suddenly, teachers said, dozens of riled-up teenagers started racing down hallways and careening down stairways with their phones to get to the fight. to stop more people from flooding into the cafeteria, revere high posted staff members in front of the lunchroom entrances and issued a “hold” order to keep students in their classrooms. administrators called the police to help restore calm. the school said it ultimately suspended 17 students involved in the brawl. across the united states, technology centered on cellphones — in the form of text messages, videos and social media — has increasingly fueled and sometimes intensified campus brawls, disrupting schools and derailing learning. the school fight videos then often spark new cycles of student cyberbullying, verbal aggression and violence. hello! i've spent the last few months reporting on tech-fueled violence in schools for this story. i'm really interested in learning about how your local schools are handling these issues. what are you seeing? what remedies do you think schools should try? @natasha singer my daughter’s school in norfolk va just installed fight detection technology in all the bathrooms so that officers can respond more quickly. @natasha singer tx parent of a middle schooler here. the school had always had a ""soft"" ban on cellphone use during class. however, last year, as in your reporting, a slew of fights broke out and it was getting worse. there was even some local news coverage of our school interviewing parents about the violence. the school responded by enforcement of the cellphone ban. things are better, not perfect. and no amount of enforcement short of confiscating phones at the entrance will really stop students from using them.so although the violence seems to have gotten a little better, cyber bullying and the online rumor mill continues. @natasha singercurrent teacher in florida here. this school year, our school board banned cellphones, headphones, airpods etc., not only during class time but in between classes and during lunch. they provided no extra personnel to help take the phones away, so the ban was not enforced. there is no difference from before the cell phone ban to after the cell phone ban. students walk around freely with their phones in hand and headphones on airpods in. some parents fought it saying their child’s 504 plans allowed them to have a phone.there was an incident of a kid masturbating to porn on his phone in the boys bathroom and another student came in and filmed him masturbating with his phone and then posted it on social media. kids commit suicide over such things.i sent an email to the superintendent and all school board members about this. i got no response.i have my students put their phones away in a sleeve, which i have been doing for several years. but i am in fighting an uphill, unsupported battle. the kids openly fight me to keep their phones, refuse put them away, or put away fake ones.at least here in southern florida, we are teaching kids that a governmental body can pass a law, but it doesn’t mean anything. and they will go out into the general public as adult and think the same thing. @natasha singer. as a conflict resolution professional, i have worked in numerous schools for the last 30 years. like the teacher in the article, i have tried to barricade and disperse students & told them to put phones away to not exacerbate the problem.days before the pandemic lockdown, the organization i worked for, creative response to conflict, completed our “social media-tors!” training with middle schoolers in queens. this program trains peer mediators to safely intervene in online conflicts.interestingly, our research showed that when students did not see each other in person, bullying decreased. students became more selective as to who they engaged with online, knowing there would be no in person ramifications the next day. bullying is fueled by the ping pong of in person and online. during the pandemic, we removed the in person element. now schools are struggling to remove phones, which may limit some of the planning and filming of fights during the school day, but it doesn’t impact everything that happens the minute students get their phones back.part of the solution involves teaching students how & why to become allies instead of bystanders or instigators. restorative practices programs also help change the school climate so people get to know each other. this reduces “othering” & makes schools safer & more welcoming, reducing skyrocketing

"I Traded My News Apps for Rumble, the Right-Wing YouTube. Here’s What I Saw.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/13/business/rumble-trump-bongino-kirk.html,"bystuart a. thompson stuart thompson has monitored right-wing media since 2020. he watched 47 hours of video on rumble for this article. as soon as president-elect donald j. trump won the presidential race, influencers on rumble, the right-wing alternative to youtube, flooded the platform with a simple catchphrase: “we are the media now.” the idea seemed to capture a growing sense that traditional journalists have lost their position at the center of the media ecosystem. polls show that trust inmainstream news media has plummeted, and thatnearly half of all young peopleget their news from “influencers” rather than journalists. in its place, they argue, are right-wing digital creators who have found hordes of fans online. rumble, for instance, is tiny compared with youtube, but it is a primary source of news for millions of americans, according topew research center. on election night, its active viewership topped out at more than two million, and the company said in a statement that it averaged more than 67 million monthly active users in the final quarter of 2024. if rumble was the media now, i wondered what it would be like to consume an all-rumble diet. so on nov. 18, about two weeks after the election, i deleted my news apps, unsubscribed from all my podcasts and filtered all my newsletters to the trash. and for the next week, from early morning till late at night, i got all my news from rumble. i started by visiting rumble’s homepage on monday morning where i saw my first recommended video. it was about the risk of nuclear war, with an a.i.-generated photo of president biden laughing maniacally above a headline that read:“wwiii incoming?!biden authorizes strike on russia ahead of trump taking office!!” rumble was once an obscure video platform featuring mostly viral cat videos. founded in 2013 by a canadian entrepreneur, it was designed as a home for independent creators who felt crowded out on youtube. but the platform took a hard right turn around the time of the capitol riots on jan. 6, 2021, when social networks and youtube cracked down on users who violated their rules. conservatives flocked to other platforms, including rumble, which quickly embraced its new role as a “free speech” haven — and saw its valuation surge to half a billion dollars practically overnight. its content today goes far beyond cat videos. video game livestreams populate its homepage alongside abizarre face-slapping competitioncalled“power slap.”but political commentary and news remain its most popular categories by far. a screenshot from the first day of this experiment shows videos about wwiii and live categories focused on news, entertainment and “conspiracies.” i chose a selection of popular “news” shows to watch, along with political content from other areas, like its active “conspiracies” section. because my experiment began so soon after mr. trump swept to victory on nov. 5, i expected many of the videos to feel triumphant. there were a few moments of joy: after the hosts of “morning joe,” the msnbc talk show,visited mr. trump at mar-a-lago, hosts of rumble shows gleefully mocked them, saying they went to“kiss the ring and bend the knee.”clips of n.f.l. athletes doing mr. trump’s dance moves were a sign, the hosts said, that mr. trump hadrecaptured popular culturefrom the clutches of hollywood liberals. but their happiness quickly gave way to a relentless outpouring of anger and frustration, as they fixated on a cast of perceived enemies to blame for america’s troubles — from democratic politicians totiktok personalitiesto republican adversaries. just a few hours into the experiment, it was clear that i was falling into an alternate reality fueled almost entirely by outrage. among the claims i heard: some people at think tanks in washington were “morons” and“crazier than any schizophrenic.” the department of homeland securitywas runninga “sex-trafficking operation,” a claim apparently based on a misreading of agovernment report. (the report, by the department of homeland security’s office of the inspector general, indicated that more than 300,000 unaccompanied minors had not received a notice to appear in court or had received the notice but had failed to appear. some conservative commentators said this meant the children were being trafficked, but experts in immigration policy said it meant no such thing.) progressives weretrying to get republicans killed— a claim based on death threats that representative marjorie taylor greene of georgia said she received. after only one day, i could feel my perspective shifting. when i described to my wife what i was hearing on rumble, she said i was right to feel uneasy because the world i was immersing myself in sounded genuinely awful. hour by hour, rumble’s hosts stoked fears about nearly everything: culture wars, transgender americans and even a potential world war iii. on the second night, while catching up on the show “redacted,” i heard that world war iii wasmore or less imminentbecause of rising tensions with russia but that most americans were unaware of it. exactly what to make of this remained unclear to me, but i suspected tensions would need to rise much further before bombs started dropping.clayton morris, a former fox news personality who co-hosts the show with his wife, seemed convinced that nuclear war was coming, describing the lack of fallout shelters in major cities throughout the united states. (i later readnews articlesthat offered afuller picture, suggesting that the risk of escalation was real but that nuclear threats were also a strategy in mr. putin’ssaber rattling.) the coverage struck me as particularly scary, but i also paused to consider whether mr. morris had any credentials as a russia-ukraine analyst. since 2017, he has pivoted his career from hosting television shows to offering investors “financial freedom” through real estate investing. he was sued in 2019 by two dozen clients who said they weresold ramshackle homesas investment properties, then relocated his family to portugal before the lawsuits were settled — whichsome saidcomplicated the litigation proceedings. (mr. morris denied any wrongdoing.) on rumble, though, he seemed authoritative: his slickly produced show had more than 560,000 followers and it aired daily with an active comments section filled with supporters. the videos were recommended to me by rumble’s algorithm, so i kept watching. other shows referenced clips directly from russian state television orthe russian government. during “the roseanne barr show,” a segment about nuclear warbled into an adfor an emergency health kit. (in an email, the show’s co-host jake pentland, who is ms. barr’s son, told me their show wants to keep americans “safe and protected from this wildly corrupt administration whether that’s through education or highlighting specific products that can protect them.”) the prospect of an impending world war iii stuck with me long after the livestreams ended. as i shuttled my son to day care or walked down aisles at the grocery store, i found my mind drifting to thoughts of nuclear bombs, a military draft or how a global conflict might actually unfold. while watching a segment on the dire prediction, i glanced over at my wife, who was enjoying netflix’s romantic comedy series “nobody wants this,” unaware about the threat of nuclear winter. as the days ticked by, i saw how the outrage stoked online could burst into the real world. early in the week, multiple hosts on rumblewere furious overa democratic official in pennsylvania who they suggested was trying to steal the election by counting invalid ballots. the controversy gained nationwide attention and the official, diane ellis marseglia, the commissioner for bucks county, pa., received profanity-laden emails and death threats. reading news articles about it later, though, it was clear the situationwas morecomplicatedthan the hosts had suggested. the courts responded withadditional guidanceand the county followed the law. the official eventually apologized for using a badly worded statement that stoked the backlash — and her apology video also made the rounds on rumble. “we are all going to learn lessons from this new media landscape,” ms. marseglia said in her apology. “most of all, i am.” dan bongino, the host of “the dan bongino show,” relished the moment. “who’s in charge now? we are,” he said triumphantly. “who made this a story? us.” it seemed clear that actual news — the objective details about complex situations like election proceedings or the war in ukraine — mattered far less than how these situations could be contorted to support mr. trump or deride democrats. nearly every show created a visceral feeling that the nation was barrelling from crisis to crisis. progressives were getting away with galling levels of incompetence or corruption, the hosts said over and over again. even though mr. trump and the republican party would soon control the white house and congress, and conservatives have a majority on the supreme court, there weremore battles to come. after just a week, this alternate reality started shifting how i instinctively reacted to the world outside rumble. i would catch a stray story on the local news radio about something innocuous, like train delays or traffic jams, and wonder: “can i really trust this?” it’s true that listening to any single news source long enough will shift your perspective. but few sources have as many ties to mr. trump and his incoming administration as rumble. its top personalities are frequently seen with mr. trump at events or at mar-a-lago, his florida home, with hosts suggesting they will have special access to the administration. vivek ramaswamy, mr. trump’s pick for a new government efficiency initiative, and howard lutnick, the likely commerce secretary, owned millions of dollars worth of rumble shares when it went public in 2022. so did craft ventures, which was co-founded by david sacks, an investor who sits on rumble’s board of directors and was recentlynamed mr. trump’s pick for cryptocurrency czar. christopher pavlovski, rumble’s founder and chief executive, has emerged as a trump ally, too. in a post on x, he shared a photo from after the election of him standing next to several people, including elon musk, one of mr. trump’s most prominent backers. at the back of the frame and grinning was the soon to be 47th president of the united states. “free speech saved,” mr. pavlovski wrote. i received a statement from tim murtaugh, a representative for rumble who was also mr. trump’s communications director for his 2020 campaign. he said: “the new york times and its fellow legacy media outlets have lost their monopoly on deciding what information people can have, so of course they’re rushing to attack rumble, a key alternative in the news marketplace.” the fear and outrage that infused every show was offset by a sense of hopefulness that the president-elect would fix everything — even that the “planet might have been saved” because he was re-elected. blame for any hiccups in mr. trump’s strategy was assigned to democrats or even republicans who were not sufficiently obedient. senator tommy tuberville, an alabama republican,said on one showthat while republicans controlled the senate, the party remained “a third maga, a third republican and a third rino,” meaning “republican in name only.” “we’ve got control, but do we have control?” mr. tuberville summarized. perhaps the biggest cheerleader for mr. trump was mr. bongino, the eponymous host of rumble’s most-watched show, with 3.4 million followers. mr. bongino is a former fox news host who ranthree unsuccessful bids for elected officebefore striking gold in the right-wing commentary business. the podcast version of his show consistently ranks amongthe top news podcastsin the country. rumble’s financial documents show that his company, bongino inc., owned 5.8 percent of the company when it went public in 2022, now worth more than $100 million. though i listened to an hour of mr. bongino’s opinions each day, it seemed like i learned mostly what various progressive or mainstream media figures had said about different culture war topics, and mr. bongino’s predictable reactions to them. many segments on mr. bongino’s show included comments from liberals or mainstream news media, along with mr. bongino’s predictable reactions to them. segments where bongino reacts to comments by liberals or mainstream media other segments each segment minutes 10 20 30 40 50 60 nov.

race. he talked about the murder conviction of an undocumented migrant — butin reaction to what a news anchorhad said about the case on abc news. nearly every show i watched on rumble framed issues this way, focusing on how news was discussed by mainstream media, and then complaining about it. i don’t remember seeing mr. bongino criticize mr. trump — not once. he spent the first part of the week saying that mr. gaetz, the former republican congressman who was briefly a contender for attorney general, would surely be confirmed. he seemed to dismissa federal sex-trafficking investigation into mr. gaetzby saying it was impossible to find “good” people for top roles. (mr. gaetz denied any wrongdoing and the justice department declined to file charges.) when mr. gaetz withdrew his name from consideration later that week after significant pushback, mr. bongino never faulted mr. trump for the whole ordeal. instead, he blamed republicans and said it was part of mr. trump’s strategy to intentionally overwhelm his critics with controversial picks. after watching rumble nonstop for days, i realized this very article was likely to fuel its own cycle of outrage on the platform. but i was surprised when that happened before it was even published. i wrote to everyone mentioned in the article to ask for their perspective about rumble and its popular shows, but few replied. instead, people like russell brand, the former actor turned political commentator, took one of my emails and made an entire segment out of it. mr. bongino called me“public enemy no. 1”and claimed my story would focus on rumble’s fringiest voices in a bid to get the site banned. “don’t ever email us,” he warned. “don’t. because you’re going to become part of the show.” mr. pentland, the co-host of “the roseanne barr podcast,” posted the email i sent him to his x account. rumble’s chief executive reposted it, then elon musk reposted that to his more than 200 million followers. my phone number was visible, and apparently seen more than 50 million times on the platform, so i was soon flooded with angry phone calls and texts calling my article (which hadn’t yet been published) a “hit job” focused on world war iii. on his show, mr. pentland referenced my email and said his original ad for a nuclear fallout health kit was meant to “educate our audience” about alternative medicines. then that segment bled intoanother adfor the health kit. stephen k. bannon, host of “war room,” relayed a message through his producer, saying that his show “exists as the information arm for the activist cadre at the tip of the spear of the maga movement.” candace owens, the host of the “candace show,” was the only one who called me back. she said she was focusing less on political outrage lately after growing weary of chasing negativity. “i realized i was waking up every day and i was looking for things to be angry at,” she said. “and that wasn’t healthy for me.” advertisement",16088,"bystuart a. thompson stuart thompson has monitored right-wing media since 2020. he watched 47 hours of video on rumble for this article. as soon as president-elect donald j. trump won the presidential race, influencers on rumble, the right-wing alternative to youtube, flooded the platform with a simple catchphrase: “we are the media now.” and for the next week, from early morning till late at night, i got all my news from rumble. but the platform took a hard right turn around the time of the capitol riots on jan. its content today goes far beyond cat videos. because my experiment began so soon after mr. 5, i expected many of the videos to feel triumphant. progressives weretrying to get republicans killed— a claim based on death threats that representative marjorie taylor greene of georgia said she received. since 2017, he has pivoted his career from hosting television shows to offering investors “financial freedom” through real estate investing. as the days ticked by, i saw how the outrage stoked online could burst into the real world. received profanity-laden emails and death threats. nearly every show created a visceral feeling that the nation was barrelling from crisis to crisis. progressives were getting away with galling levels of incompetence or corruption, the hosts said over and over again. its top personalities are frequently seen with mr. trump’s pick for a new government efficiency initiative, and howard lutnick, the likely commerce secretary, owned millions of dollars worth of rumble shares when it went public in 2022. he said: “the new york times and its fellow legacy media outlets have lost their monopoly on deciding what information people can have, so of course they’re rushing to attack rumble, a key alternative in the news marketplace.” trump’s strategy was assigned to democrats or even republicans who were not sufficiently obedient. 18 19 20 21 22 note: times are approximate on his thursday show, he talked about the nation’s intelligence apparatus — but it was in response to whata cnn host had saidabout its effectiveness. he spent the first part of the week saying that mr. gaetz, the former republican congressman who was briefly a contender for attorney general, would surely be confirmed. instead, he blamed republicans and said it was part of mr. but i was surprised when that happened before it was even published. pentland, the co-host of “the roseanne barr podcast,” posted the email i sent him to his x account. then that segment bled intoanother adfor the health kit.",Stuart thompson has monitored right-wing media since 2020.

bridge manhattan bridge brooklyn bridge hugh l. carey tunnel congestion pricing has been debated for decades, and opponents have fought hard to diminish or stop the tolls, which would bethe first of its kind in the united states. under public pressure, gov. kathy hochul had blocked the program just weeks before its original start date in june. at the time, she cited concerns about the possible impact that the tolls could have on new york’s economy,an idea disputed by many experts. when she revived the program in november, she introduced a 40 percent discount in rates across the board for several years. the metropolitan transportation authority, the state agency that runs the city’s subway and buses and two commuter rail lines,plans to phase in higher rates later. officials are racing to implementthe programbefore president-elect donald j. trump, a powerful opponent who has promised to end the project, takes office on jan. 20. and at least 10 lawsuitscould still unravel the planahead of its start date. here is a closer look at how the tolls would work for most drivers. click the dropdowns below to see more options the program has been designed to reduce the volume of personal automobiles because they make up a large share of manhattan’s traffic.  there would be a cap of one toll per day for passenger vehicles entering the designated tolling zone. the base toll for personal cars has been set at a higher amount than for motorcycles, taxis or ride-hail vehicles in hopes of encouraging drivers to use mass transit or other options, like carpooling, that contribute less to traffic. those enrolled in the e-zpass system would pay a lower fee than if they were not. thee-zpass systemis used by many east coast states to collect tolls on bridges and highways, and transportation officials say it is the most efficient method to charge drivers. those traveling over a bridge that is not tolled otherwise would pay the base toll and not receive a credit.  those who would pay the new toll with e-zpass would receive an additional credit if they would exit the zone using the queens-midtown and hugh l. carey tunnels, regardless of entry point. the base toll would apply during the most congested hours: from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. click the dropdowns below to see more options taxis and app-based ride-hail services such as uber and lyft are a significant source of traffic in manhattan, and passengers who use them already pay other congestion fees. passengers in these vehicles — not drivers — would pay a new fee per trip into, out of and within the zone.  the average fare in 2023 for trips in the zone, without tip, was $26 for taxis and $36 for passengers using ride-hail apps, according to transportation officials. taxis made an average of 12 daily trips and ride-hail vehicles made six. the fee for passengers in taxis would be slightly lower than for passengers in ride-hail vehicles, which make fewer trips and are more likely to idle in the zone. public officials want to avoid driving customers away from the struggling taxi industry. taxi drivershave faced many challengesover the past decade, such as predatory loans and the rise of for-hire apps. click the dropdowns below to see more options one of the goals of congestion pricing is to reduce air pollution in and around manhattan. trucks are some of the biggest contributors to noise, smog and other pollutants around busy roads.buses also take up much more spaceand contribute more to congestion compared with smaller vehicles.  there would be no daily cap on tolled trips made by trucks or buses. these vehicles, like those used as u-hauls and for package deliveries, would be charged lower tolls than large trucks and tour buses. but their fees would be higher than those for passenger vehicles because they still take up a large amount of space on the road and can cause delays while driving and turning. drivers enrolled in the e-zpass system would pay a lower fee than if they were not. thee-zpass systemis used by many east coast states to collect tolls on bridges and highways, and transportation officials say it is the most efficient method to charge drivers. drivers traveling through a tunnel with a pre-existing toll would be granted a credit to offset the cost of the new toll.  drivers who would pay the new toll with e-zpass would receive an additional credit if they would exit the zone using the queens-midtown and hugh l. carey tunnels, regardless of entry point. peak fees would apply during the most congested hours: from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. officials want to discourage deliveries and commercial traffic during these hours. click the dropdowns below to see more options transit officials have tried to keep the new toll affordable by establishing tax credits and discounts for people with low incomes who would have to drive into the zone for work. but this would be avery small fraction of drivers.  out of the 22 million people who live in the region and the 1.5 million who work in the zone, an estimated 16,000 people with household incomes under $50,000 drive to work into the zone. thatrepresents only 1 percent of its workers, according to a recent analysis of federal demographic data. some workers who earn less than $50,000 per year may have no alternative to driving to work in the zone. because the toll may pose a financial hardship, they could sign up for a program that would provide a 50 percent discount from the peak toll price after their first 10 trips in a calendar month. the discount would not apply for off-peak toll rates.  low-income residents of the congestion zone who make less than $60,000 a yearcould apply for a state tax credit. click the dropdowns below to see more options public officials have tried to keep exemptions to a minimum in order, they say, to evenly balance the burden of the new tolls among drivers, to discourage drivers from using vehicles in the zone as much as possible and to aim for generating $15 billion to pay for better subways and buses. when state lawmakers established the program in 2019, they shielded emergency vehicles from paying the tolls. those vehicles would include ambulances, police vehicles, correction vehicles, fire vehicles and blood delivery vehicles. manhattan’s new tolling program is still being challenged in federal and state courts, with rulings possible before it begins on jan. 5. gov. kathy hochul has fast-tracked the new tolls to enter midtown and lower manhattan. drivers could be charged beginning in january. new york city is constantly changing, opening the door to both new battles over traffic and radical solutions. notes: each mock trip

(singing) what is love? here’s to love. love. from “the new york times,” i’m anna martin. this is “modern love.” [music playing] are you ready to go? i’m ready to go. ok. let’s do it. today i’m talking to my colleague, eli tan. thanks for having me on. eli is a reporter at “the times.” he’s 26. he lives in san francisco, and he’s single. that means eli, like nearly every other single person i know, is on the dating apps. and also, just like every other single person i know, eli thinks the dating apps are awful. he told me every conversation he has feels exactly the same. honestly, it feels like this liminal interaction that you can have a dozen times a day where it’s always the same type of thing. and no one ever remembers the conversation they have with someone on a dating app. you never continue that in the real world. no. it’s kind of this weird, performative interaction that you do just to get to the next step. do you feel trapped by these apps? like, do you feel like it’s the only way that you can meet people? in a lot of ways, i do, yeah. i think i’ve looked at the data of how many relationships after college start on dating apps nowadays, and it’s like the vast majority or something. so in a lot of ways, it feels like it’s something that everyone is doing. but also, if it’s possible, if we could all just stop going on dating apps, we would. [laughs]: but — it’s so true. yeah. — it’s kind of like how people feel addicted to social media, and they say, i wish that nobody was on it, because then i wouldn’t feel a need to be on it. completely. and that’s how i feel about dating apps. i mean, i’ve spent years on dating apps. and at one point, i went and i actually listened to the hinge founder’s — he went on podcasts and talked about, well, here are the best ways to make your profile. what did he say? he just said — he’s like, have a photo with friends. i’m like, i know. it was very data-driven. he said, ok, this many of the relationships start when you have a fun prompt. and you always want to be responding to prompts. you don’t want to be just — ugh! — sending likes out into the ether. and i said, ok. if i’m going to be on these apps, i might as well have an approach that would work. it’s so easy to get fatigued with swiping and talking that i thought, oh, if there’s a data-driven way to make this better, i should try to do it and see how it works. [music playing] the thing is that data-driven approach didn’t really work for eli. he optimized his profile, chose the best discussion prompts he could, the best photos. and he was going on more dates, sure, but he couldn’t find anyone he really connected with. but then eli learned about a new kind of dating app, apps that promised to solve his problems using ai. so eli signed up. he made ai clones of himself that could go on hundreds of virtual dates. and he used ai dating coaches to help him flirt, kind of be his wingman. i’ve never heard of someone dating like this, ever. so that’s what we’re talking about today. what happened when eli handed over control of his dating life to ai, and whether this technology can solve our dating woes? stick with us. ok, eli, you are here to talk about dating using ai. and i guess i’m curious, in the broadest sense, why would someone do that? why introduce ai into our dating life? so the problem, i think, it’s trying to solve is that talking to people and matching with people on dating apps can be this tedious and time consuming thing. and the idea is that if you clone yourself as an ai and the ai can take care of that initial conversation when you’re kind of feeling out if you might like someone or not, then it can save you time. and then if you have so many of these dates, the best one or two are going to be with somebody that’s really compatible. so in that way, it can save you time as well. in my case, i had my clone — it was going on hundreds of dates a week, which is more than i would ever be able to go on by myself. i can usually, at most, probably manage one date a week. i have so many questions about everything you just said. but before we do that, i just want to make something really clear. you weren’t just using a demo or something here. these were real apps that were made to help people use ai in their dating lives. and you actually did this making a real profile, using your real name, your real photos, earnestly trying to meet someone. were you nervous for that? not really. i think i was more curious. [laughs]: not at all? well, what’s the worst that can happen? not really, no. oh, my — i mean, i thought it might be kind of weird or a little bit dystopian, people tell me. but personally, i was more just curious, and i thought the whole thing was kind of a humorous thing to try. oh, really? oh, my gosh. yeah. i’d be really scared. i’d be really nervous. i just feel like — i don’t know. i would not do an experiment with my actual love life. and i’m the one that hosts a podcast about love. like, i would feel very nervous about doing that. i don’t know — maybe that’s ego? it’s cool to me that you were just purely curious about it. yeah, some of it’s probably that dating apps can be so frustrating anyways. you’re like, let’s just blow it up and see. yeah, why not? how much worse can things get? i’ll make a clone of myself and date that way. why not? let’s try it. why not? ok, i want to get into the specifics here. when it comes to the cloning apps, what apps were you using, and what did they do? so for the cloning apps, i used one app called ice, which let me create a clone that could then talk to real people. and then i used another app called volar, which let me create clones that talked to other people’s clones. break that down for me. you’re trying to duplicate your personality in an ai clone. what does that look like? how are you training this computer model? well, each of these clones had their own chat bot that would essentially be like my brain. so i would basically be texting these clones like i would a close friend so that they could pick up on my cadence and — your mannerisms. — the things that i’m interested in. the clones would ask me what i’m looking for in a relationship and try to feel that out so that when it went out there itself into the dating pool, it could act just like me. and can i ask you, what types of questions, the specific questions it was asking you and how you responded? yeah, it would be the typical dating interest. so like, oh, what do you like to do on the weekends? what are you looking for in a relationship? what are your love languages? uh-huh. and what did you say you were looking for? what type of relationships you’ve been in. for the purposes of this, i said, yeah, i’m looking for a serious relationship. i’m looking for a serious partner. mm-hmm. and what did you say you liked to do on the weekends? i’m just trying to get a sense of, i guess, you, but really your clone. so that’s where it got difficult because it can be difficult to put your personality into text like that. totally. it’s like, hang out with friends and chat. yeah, [inaudible]. and then at the end of the day, we’re all similar because everyone likes to go out and eat at restaurants and hang out at parks. and work out, yeah. yeah, and then there was one particular thing i had a really difficult time, which was trying to explain to my clone that i like the outdoors, and i like nature, but i don’t actually really go in the outdoors much, and i don’t really go hiking. so my clone would always tell people that, oh, i went on this hike this weekend, and i did this, and i had to explain to it like, no, i say i like those things, but i’ve never actually owned hiking shoes, you know? i don’t know any of these places you’re mentioning because i’m just more kind of the idea of being an outdoorsy person, those type of things that seemed intuitive to me. your clone’s like, and i just got back from climbing mount kilimanjaro, and you’re like — exactly. — we need to roll that back. and i’m like — i walked up a hill. — yeah, i didn’t do that. yeah, yeah, yeah. i want to clarify, do these clones hook into existing dating apps that we have, like hinge and tinder? or are they on separate apps? so the clone apps are separate apps. ok. from what i understand, a lot of these really popular dating apps are working on creating their own clones, but that’s all internal for now. so i used basically smaller apps that are — yeah, they’re their own thing. so you log on to them, and you have your own profile. and they don’t connect to places like hinge — gotcha. — tinder. you log on to them. you train the clone. like you said, you upload the photos. and you’re texting it and telling it about what you enjoy. and it’s picking up on your cadence. and so you train up this clone that then goes out and has conversations with who? so the clones would have conversations with other people’s clones. so at the end of every day, i would get a notification that said, your clone went on 100 dates today. check and see how they went. and i could go through — oh, my god. — and i could look at these long conversations that these two clones would have together. and if i wanted to, i could say, ok, i think this worked out really well. i think there’s something here. i can manually enter. and then our clones become humans, and we talk that way. so you’d open up your phone after just doing other things during the day, doing your job, hanging out with real people in the world, and you log on to this app and it would say, your clone has gone on 100 dates, and you functionally read transcripts of these dates? yeah. so i would get a notification that my clone had gone on 10 or 20 or 30 dates, and then i could go in and i could read back through those transcripts and see how they went. did you ever log into your app and see them just chatting it up and feel like you were intruding? yeah, if you were on the app, you could click on a conversation and see the messages go back and forth every few seconds if you wanted to. ooh. and then i could say, oh, this person likes doing so-and-so, and, oh, they like going to this place. i do, too. but then the weird thing was seeing — it didn’t happen often, but moments of intimacy between two clones, where it really didn’t feel like it was me and another person. it felt like my clone was kind of its own thing. and what i found was that my clone really did have a personality of its own. even if i tried to train it on certain things, it would enjoy going to its own restaurants and coffee shops and stuff like that. can you give me an example of a moment of intimacy that you saw between your clone and someone else’s clone, if you can remember? it would be very brief, but it would be like after a long conversation, my clone would say something like, i really like you. and then the other clone would say, i like you, too, or something like that — ok, stop. — something very raw. how did real eli feel reading clone eli and clone lisa having this moment of like, “i like you,” “i like you“? what did that feel like to you, reading the transcript of this clone conversation? it felt totally bizarre, and it felt like something that i was not involved in. and it didn’t make me want to jump in and take over. it felt like, oh, no, this is kind of its own thing happening. interesting. and yeah, i didn’t do this. this is — well, that was going to be my question. it’s like, in reading a transcript of a clone date that ostensibly went really well — they’re hitting it off — clone sparks are flying — are you then like, man, i want to get in this app and talk to real lisa? it sounds like your answer to that is no. it’s almost so uncanny valley, or it feels separate from you. and it doesn’t make you actually want to get in touch with the real person behind that clone. yeah, i would say that’s definitely true. huh. i don’t know. if that were me and i was carrying my phone around all day, and i knew that inside my phone, my clone was going on hundreds of dates — [laughs] it felt like this secret life i had in my phone, where — totally. — i would look at the notification and look around, and i would say, no one even knows that my clone just went on 100 dates. [laughs]: no one even knows that my clone’s a player. my clone is on its way to date all of san francisco in one month. ok, how is that actually time-saving, though? like, you open up the app, and it’s like, your clone went on 100 dates. do they rank them in terms of compatibility, or do you need to read through basically 100 transcripts of dates? because that does not feel quicker to me. yeah, so this app did not rank them. but i’ve talked to people that work for dating app companies that say, oh, well, we can then manually run a program that will find the best three conversations. i mean, there’s an episode of “black mirror” that’s like this, where it’s like a futuristic dating app where people’s clones are trapped in this universe, and they have to find each other. oh, yeah. and they have to find love. and i actually talked to a few different founders that told me straight up, they said, yeah, it was inspired by that episode to — oh, my god. — create this app. and i thought, oh, wow, that’s interesting because that was like a dystopia. that wasn’t like a happy story. i would 100 percent say that. [music playing] when we come back, eli and i do a dramatic reading of one of his clone’s conversations. you will not want to miss it. [music playing] ok, so you just told us about this way that clones can go on dates with other clones, but there’s another use of clones, ai clones and dating, correct? yes, the other way that you can use clones and that i tried out was that you could go into another app, and you could look through a list of clones and people, and you could pick which one you wanted to talk to. and then i myself could have a conversation with the clone. so it’s you yourself, you, human, real eli. yes, human eli could go into the app, and it could say, ok, look at 100 of these profiles of these people. which one do i think i would be interested in or do i think is attractive? and i can click on that person, and i can just immediately enter a conversation with that person’s clone. so what is the problem-solve there? what’s the purpose? it’s not totally — i think the purpose would be that on the other end — right. — you can see not only that somebody is interested in talking with you, but then you have, basically, this preemptive conversation. and you can see, oh, ok, what are they like? yeah. so instead of having this pile of swipes or likes on a dating app that is two-dimensional, you now have this three-dimensional thing where you can see how you might have gotten along with this person or how your clone managed the conversation. and you get to see — interesting. — a little bit more about them than you would just with photos. yeah, there’s more evidence, almost, for potentially actually engaging with this human person as another human person. ok, so there’s this conversation that you include in the article you wrote about this experiment, eli, where your clone is interacting with a real person. so it’s this kind of conversational dynamic we’re talking about. and i want to do something that will be fun, ok? i want to have us act out that conversation because i really think the listeners need to hear it in its full glory. so your clone is talking to this real person named rachel. you are going to be your clone. i’m going to be rachel. and we’re going to go for it. i need to get into character for a second. i’m going to embody rachel. and i need you to put yourself in the space of being your clone. ok. you feel ready? i’m ready. ok. go for it. if you could only eat one snack for the rest of your life, what would it be? mozzarella sticks. crunchy, cheesy bliss. [laughs]: what is it about mozzarella sticks that make your heart skip a beat? lol. it gives pizza vibes but with much more cheese. what’s your go-to? expensive cheese and bread all the way. there’s something about the richness that makes my heart sing. what’s your fave pizza topping, by the way? pepperoni. and what do you mean by expensive cheese? pepperoni perfection. [laughs]: ok, ok, ok. when you read this transcript again between your clone and this real person, rachel, what’s your immediate thought? oh, i was cringing. [laughs]: i thought this was — i mean, i remember when i first read this conversation on the app — because it works ok when i’m messaging other people because i’m in control. of course. but the horrifying part is then seeing all the things my clone was saying to people. so you’re saying you wouldn’t — i was just thinking, oh, my gosh, why would it say this? crunchy, cheesy bliss? followed by the pepperoni perfection. it was like too many catchphrases. like, it was just too much. it’s really bad. i mean, it’s really bad. are you like, what have i wrought? like, what else are you thinking? yeah, typically the reaction would be, ok, i need to fix something because you can train the clone when it makes mistakes. and you can kind of do pep talks with it and say, ok, we can’t talk like this anymore. we can’t be doing these catchphrases. like, you tell the clone, all right, no more catchphrases. or you don’t need to talk so much about cheese and food. and it’s ok to do other stuff. [laughs]: but my reaction, it was like — yeah, it was like wanting to discipline this clone for — what if this person was someone that i really liked? and it was like — well, what if you — — well, now it’s botched this opportunity — i was just — — and i could have maybe done it better myself. i was going to say, did that thought occur to you? like, what if rachel was a potential match, and then she heard “pepperoni perfection” from your clone, and she was like, i’m out? like — i don’t know — that’s what i meant by, were you nervous to do this? yeah, that was, i think, the part that took courage, was to say, ok, i’m just going to do it, even if it might torpedo this interaction. or if i think i could actually salvage this, i’m just going to see if the clone can do it and can turn it around. interesting. and in that way, it felt like it was a little bit out of my control. but with something like this, rachel knew that she was talking to my clone. yeah. so she probably had an understanding that, ok, this is not exactly how eli talks — or hopefully not. i want to flip the script a bit. so that was your clone talking to a real person. when you were the real person talking to a clone, what was that like for you? yeah, that wasn’t great either. i mean, what i ended up finding was that most people have the same four or five interests. and it can be kind of hard to animate that or to create any sense of chemistry. and a lot of the times, the things that make us who we are, they’re just very difficult to put down or to train a clone on. and what it helped me with was seeing what a person’s broad interests were and the things that they like to do and more of that biographical detail. but it didn’t help me at all realize if i had any chemistry with that person. so in that way, the clones have kind of an impossible task where even if they could perfectly replicate flirting and the way we talk to each other, it would only go so far, i think. yeah. i wonder if this experiment taught you anything about the nature of conversations on dating apps, because listening to you talk, i’m wondering whether ai is involved or not, how is talking about our favorite foods supposed to help us build a connection with someone else? like, maybe there’s just a problem with dating on an app, period, is that we’re talking about the wrong stuff. yeah, but thinking a lot about that because i think when you go on an actual date, within the first few minutes, no matter what you’re really talking about, you can get a sense if you like that person or not. and for whatever reason, when you do that virtually over text, it’s just not the same, even if you’re talking about something that might be more realistic. there’s something about the in-person chemistry that’s not coming through. [music playing] when we come back, eli tells us about a more promising way to use ai in dating. [music playing] so, eli, we talked about these ai clones of yourself that you made to go on all these virtual dates for you, but i know you also used an app called amori that had these ai dating coaches. and these seemed to me like something i would actually use. i could not see myself cloning myself, but i honestly really could see myself popping over to my ai dating coach and being like, oh, what do you think about this situation? or was the text i just sent totally freaking weird? or how should i respond to this? tell me about those dating coaches. are they what i imagine them to be? yes, the dating coaches, in one of the apps, they all had different personalities. so one of them was a wise aunt figure. oh, my god. and one of them was like the bro best friend. and another one was christie, the blunt bestie, who’s — she was the most popular on the app, i was told, by its founder — duh. — because she was so sassy, and she would tell it like it is, you know? so, yeah, i could upload conversations that i’d have with somebody off of dating apps, whether it was texting on imessages or whatever it was. and the clone or the dating coach would look at all the messages, and i could ask it questions about how the conversation was going. like what kinds of questions? so i would ask, do you think this person’s interested in me romantically, or do you think it’s more of a friend situation? yeah. and christie would say, oh, i’m kind of — christie’s blunt bestie? christie, the blunt bestie. right. she would say, oh, i’m kind of getting buddy vibes from this one. oh, god. or i think this one might — maybe we can spice it up. but right now, i think this is more just kind of a platonic thing. that’s so blunt bestie vibes. is this an actual thing that you uploaded to christie and she actually said that to you? yes, yes. ok, and what was your emotional reaction when blunt bestie ai dating coach told you that? like, a “aw“? one of the situations, i was like, i don’t know, christie. i mean, i think there might be something there. so in one of the cases, i switched over to ethan the wingman, which is one of the other coaches that i would use because he’s more of my bro. [laughs]: and he’s always going to hype me up. like, he’s never looking to shut things down. he’s always looking for solutions. yeah. so i asked him — so you uploaded the same conversation and you said to eli. yeah, i uploaded the same conversation, and he was much more optimistic. i mean, he picked out specific things that she sent or said that he said, this could be really good. and who did you decide to believe — christie, blunt bestie, or ethan, your bro? in that case, i stuck with ethan, my bro. but in a lot of the cases, it’s true. christie, her feedback actually was pretty good. can i just follow up? so ethan said, like, go for it, man. there could be something here. there could be a spark. and so did you proceed with the conversation in that way? did you try to see if there was something romantic there? and was ethan right, basically, is my question. i think in that case, ethan was probably more right. but i think it really more comes down to just looking at these conversations with optimism or being really cautious and safe. huh. which is what the two coaches represented, more than actually picking up on the specific things. can i ask you, did anything come of that relationship? did you guys end up going on a date, date? uh, no, not with that person. ok, but ethan was right that there was something a little more there, but it just didn’t pan out? i think so personally. my read was closer to how ethan saw it than christie. copy that. all right, gotcha. when you were asking these dating coaches to generate a response to something someone had said to you on an app, would you disclose to the people on hinge or whatever who were applying, would you tell them — you’d send them a message, and then would you say, like, and by the way, that was generated using ai? would you disclose that to them? i would not disclose it to them in the moment. ok. but if i would go on a date with that person, i would tell them, and i would see what they thought about it — and what — — because that felt more honest than just living this — what did people think? — this lie. how did you say it? like, and by the way, that cool line that drew you in, that was from the rizzler or whatever. [laughs] well, i would always bring it up. i would try to do like a roundabout way to bring it up, where i said, oh, actually — ‘cause i saw you’re a journalist. what are you writing about? i’m actually writing about this dating app story where you can use ai to generate messages. and they’re like, that’s so weird. i would totally know if someone used that. and i’m like, well, could you tell that i actually used it for these few messages? and they would be like, oh, no, i didn’t. i didn’t know. or they would say, oh, yeah, now that you say that, i can kind of tell. yeah. but most people were pretty put off by the idea. i never met someone that was like, i’m going to try that myself. that never happened. would you feel — i don’t know — a bit of a weight lifted off your shoulders when you finally disclose that you were using ai? did it feel like you were admitting something? a little bit. yeah. i wondered how it would reflect on me if it would make me seem either kind of dishonest or — huh. — like i wasn’t super genuine because i was using this. i mean, in one case, this person that i’ve actually been on a few dates with, the ai actually came up with this inside joke that is still kind of a thing. and i have not disclosed that this actually wasn’t me that — oh, my gosh. — created this. well, eli, are you going to, or it’s too late now? i mean, i guess she’ll hear this episode and then know that. but something like that, i just felt like, oh, this is weird. is this something that’s coming from me, or is this kind of inorganic, though? can we know what the joke is, or is that too — yeah, i have some prompt on my hinge profile about — it’s like, “i know the best —” these are all so silly already. it’s like, “i know the best place in town for —” and then you fill it in. i think i said something like dim sum. nice. and she had asked about it. and i had been using this product kind of like chatgpt. it’s called claude. and claude was actually a little bit funnier. it was like a little bit better with the banter, and its whole thing was that it wasn’t telling her what the place was. and it was just trying to do other stuff or telling her — yeah, it was diverting. — oh, maybe if i trust you more, i can tell you. funny. so — and you still haven’t told her — — that has kind of continued on. i’ve still never told this person about this dim sum place. wait, i have to ask, are you still seeing this person? i am. yeah, we’re getting dim sum on this week, actually. and i’m probably going to have to confess while i’m there that the ai came up with that dim sum restaurant. [laughs]: you know what’s striking me about this sort of usage of ai and dating, like the showing of the conversations and asking for advice, i do that literally all of the time with just my friends, right? i’ve been talking to this person on and off, and i am basically sending screenshots of our entire conversation from start to finish, sending off like 65 images to the friend group chat, asking for feedback. like, this is what i’m doing with my friends, and it strikes me like ai is kind of doing that, but worse? possibly, yeah. i think one alternative way to look at that would be you can’t always berate your friends a dozen times a day, sending them screenshots about conversations. my friends love it. your friends love it? [laughs]: yeah, my friends would probably, i think, get tired eventually if i was like, can you come up with another opener? ok, what about another? what about another? i see what you’re saying, yeah. if you’re trying to use this stuff en masse, the ai might make sense. so actually, at one point, i have a best friend who is very similar to ethan, the wingman, in my life. and at one point, i was like, oh, i’ll send both of them screenshots and see the difference. interesting. you put this to the test, the question i just asked you. i put it to the test. yeah. yeah, my friend in real life, his name is ryan. but ryan is not very good at dating apps. so i was like, well, i don’t know if any of this advice is going to be really great. i don’t have somebody that nails with the advice in real life about this stuff. i don’t have a group chat that can actually give me — you got to get yourself a blunt bestie, babe. i know. i do. i really need that in real life. that might help me out. are you still using the ai? the story’s published. it came out. are you still using these ai tools post-publish, or did you delete the clone apps from your phone the second that you were done with this story? i have not been using the clone apps. a couple of them actually shut down after i finished reporting this because they couldn’t raise more money, or they didn’t have very much success. cheesy, crunchy bliss was just not making a lot? that was a killer for them. something i still do, i still ask this chatgpt service sometimes to recommend me date spots or things we can do or activities we can do in certain neighborhoods. because at this point, the service actually knows me pretty well. we’ve talked enough about — wow. — how dates go. and a lot of the times, it will actually give me really good recommendations. well, help me make something of it. right now, it sounds like, in some way, the clone version of you or the ai tools have embedded themselves into the way that you’re using these dating apps. like, do you think this experience of reporting the story has fundamentally changed the way you’re approaching dating in your life and will approach dating? i think so. i think it has. and i think it’s changed the way that i see my profile. and when you animate some of the ways that you describe yourself on apps or put them into conversation, it’s like, oh, this actually comes off differently than maybe i thought it did. huh. maybe i will actually not market myself as much of an outdoorsy person because i’m not or something like that. yeah, yeah. after all of this, what is your verdict? is ai going to fix our dating woes, our app fatigue? i think my takeaway is less about, can ai solve my dating life, and more, do i want it to? there are some things that, yeah, maybe i can do this. but do i want to be automating out my relationships and my dating and these moments of first meeting somebody and having meetcutes? like, why would i want a robot to do that? i think that’s just something that i want to do myself. and i got so many emails from readers that said, dude, just go — older readers that were 60, 70 years old that would say — what did they say? wait, that’s so cute. they were saying, back in my day, i would just go out and i would just smile at women on the street. and if they smiled back, i would go up and talk to them. you should try that. and part of me is thinking like, ok, glenn, it’s not 1970, and times have changed. it’s actually not ok to just go out and smile at a bunch of women. we actually have to be mo",32131,"for more audio journalism and storytelling,download new york times audio, a new ios app available for news subscribers. please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. love is stronger than anything you can feel. today i’m talking to my colleague, eli tan. and also, just like every other single person i know, eli thinks the dating apps are awful. he told me every conversation he has feels exactly the same. like, do you feel like it’s the only way that you can meet people? so in a lot of ways, it feels like it’s something that everyone is doing. he just said — he’s like, have a photo with friends. he said, ok, this many of the relationships start when you have a fun prompt. so that’s what we’re talking about today. and i guess i’m curious, in the broadest sense, why would someone do that? and the idea is that if you clone yourself as an ai and the ai can take care of that initial conversation when you’re kind of feeling out if you might like someone or not, then it can save you time. i can usually, at most, probably manage one date a week. and i’m the one that hosts a podcast about love. and what did you say you liked to do on the weekends? so my clone would always tell people that, oh, i went on this hike this weekend, and i did this, and i had to explain to it like, no, i say i like those things, but i’ve never actually owned hiking shoes, you know? and so you train up this clone that then goes out and has conversations with who? and i could look at these long conversations that these two clones would have together. and if i wanted to, i could say, ok, i think this worked out really well. it would be very brief, but it would be like after a long conversation, my clone would say something like, i really like you. and it didn’t make me want to jump in and take over. it felt like, oh, no, this is kind of its own thing happening. my clone is on its way to date all of san francisco in one month. so it’s you yourself, you, human, real eli. yes, human eli could go into the app, and it could say, ok, look at 100 of these profiles of these people. which one do i think i would be interested in or do i think is attractive? and you can see, oh, ok, what are they like? ok, so there’s this conversation that you include in the article you wrote about this experiment, eli, where your clone is interacting with a real person. so your clone is talking to this real person named rachel. and i need you to put yourself in the space of being your clone. it gives pizza vibes but with much more cheese. and in that way, it felt like it was a little bit out of my control. so she probably had an understanding that, ok, this is not exactly how eli talks — or hopefully not. and it can be kind of hard to animate that or to create any sense of chemistry. but it didn’t help me at all realize if i had any chemistry with that person. i wonder if this experiment taught you anything about the nature of conversations on dating apps, because listening to you talk, i’m wondering whether ai is involved or not, how is talking about our favorite foods supposed to help us build a connection with someone else?

one of the situations, i was like, i don’t know, christie. laughs]: and he’s always going to hype me up. i mean, he picked out specific things that she sent or said that he said, this could be really good. and was ethan right, basically, is my question. did you guys end up going on a date, date?

[theme music] love now and for always. did you fall in love? just tell her i love her. love is stronger than anything you can feel. for the love. love. and i love you more than anything. (singing) what is love? here’s to love. love. [theme music] from “the new york times,” i’m anna martin. this is “modern love.” this year marks the 20th anniversary of the “modern love” column. 20 years — can you believe that? two decades of essays that have made us laugh, made us gasp, broken our hearts, reminded us of the fundamental goodness of people. and — let’s be honest — a lot of these essays should come with tissues. it’s kind of our thing here — making you cry. to mark this big anniversary, we’ve got a conversation with “modern love” founder daniel jones. dan has edited around 1,000 essays since the first one ran back in 2004. and when you spend all your professional time contemplating human connection, that work doesn’t stay at the office. it impacts you in profound ways. so today, dan shares the three essays that have changed the way he approaches love and relationships in his own life. so it feels strange to say what i say to guests on the show, which is welcome, because, really, you welcomed me into this universe. so instead of saying welcome, i’m going to say, dan jones, hello, and thank you so much. it is great to be back here. the “modern love” column has been around for almost 20 years, which is a long time. and i do not say this in a rude way, but that also means that you are 20 years older than you were when you started it. is there anything that’s happened in your life over those two decades that has changed your approach to the work or reframed it in some way? hmm. i’ve gone from being young to less young over that time. [laughs] delicately put. [laughs] i started the column with children who are now very much adults and have gone through their own breakups and traumas and all of that and got out into the world and gotten jobs. my marriage of 29 years came to an amicable end. my father died, and there’s been a lot of tough family time since then. but i feel like my life was pretty stable during the family child rearing years. and then, oddly timed to the pandemic, i have to say — [laughs] has happened to many, yeah. — it just opened up, and it was like the column was saying to me, ok, you’re going to experience the whole range of what you’ve been putting out there. and interestingly enough, i feel like working on the column for all these years has given me touchstones and tools — and not just for me, for other people, too — to be able to navigate difficult times in life. it feels like this churning reservoir of human experience that feeds into your veins if you are open to it. i love what you said, that you gave so much to the column. and now you’re in this place in your career and your life where it’s giving back to you. i mean, what a — it’s like an annuity program, you know? yeah, it’s like a 401(k). right, right. exactly. it’s like a roth ira. it’s the “modern love” 401(k). that’s a sexy way to say it, right? you know? i’m withdrawing. [gasps]: i’m getting close to the age where i’m going to be forced to withdraw. so that’s a good thing. people are loving this metaphor. yeah. ok, so that’s where you are now. but when you were starting the column, did you see yourself as an expert in relationships or in romance? i wasn’t great at romantic relationships. i was like, how does this work? how does this work? wait — i was really terrible at it in high school. i was really terrible at it in college. mm-hmm. i still found it really hard. i had my first girlfriend in grad school. [laughs]: took you a while. but very slow learning, very shy. but i think just the weightiness of romantic relationships is a scary thing. and i wasn’t paralyzed with fear or anything. i assumed i’d get married and have a family. all those things were just assumptions and didn’t seem all that hard to make happen, in a way. but the complications of relationships and loss and just all those big things, i felt like those were things that happened to somebody else. those were out there and were these deep, dark wells that i hadn’t really experienced and didn’t have a sense of how to navigate. hmm. how did the people in your life react when you told them like, hey, i got a new gig. i will be covering love and relationships [laughs]: at “the new york times“? how did people react? some people were just — they were surprised that that would be my subject. huh. and that would be my beat, in a way. to me, i don’t think of love and relationships as being a beat. i think of it as being like the center of all life, you know? it’s like, it’s not off to the side. say that, mm-hmm. it’s the center of things. honestly, i don’t like the word “romance.” it just feels shallow and — or schlocky? — schlocky and whatever. but the word “love” has it all. it’s like, that’s the core of human existence, it seems to me. it’s the stuff of life and loss and death and yearning and dreaming and all of that stuff. mm. have you come to that understanding of these stories about love are really stories about life? did you enter into the column, the early days of this column, with that understanding, or has that been worked out over 20 years of editing these pieces? we started that way a little intentionally. we made it clear that the stories were not just about romantic relationships. it was of family relationships and friendships and parenthood and the whole gamut of human love and bonds. and in coming up with a title, “modern love,” we wanted an umbrella that was wide enough to encompass love. and the “modern” part of it could mean a lot of things. to me, it meant something that was contemporary, like a way we connect that we didn’t use to, or the way we use technology, the way we have children that we didn’t use to, all of those ways that are now. and we just thought “modern” would cover that piece of it. ok, so another big part of the column is that it’s totally based on reader submissions, meaning anyone can send in their idea for a story and you select the ones you want to edit and then publish. why did you go with that submission model as opposed to commissioning stories from famous writers or other well-known people? i just thought, let’s just open the floodgates and see what comes in. i didn’t realize at the time what a great idea that was because — [laughs]: i realized later, i’m a genius. i’m a freakin’ genius for coming up with that. but not like it’s any kind of new idea, but for this kind of a forum, it was essential. and as an example, we published a story by a bangladeshi immigrant who’d been a taxi driver in new york in an arranged marriage from bangladesh, had won the visa lottery and moved here. then they settled in queens. they had a daughter. she became a doctor. and i asked him, what made you write this story, your love story from 30 years ago, and bringing it up to now? what made you submit it? and he said, oh, i’ve been reading “modern love” for 20 years. oh. you know? mm-hmm. i’ve been reading it every week. and he wasn’t a writer. he’d just been reading the column and thought — wow. — i have a story. all these people who have stories, they read stories. they think, what about my story? and that’s something i was late in realizing, that it was just — it had drawn stories out of people who otherwise would not have told them. mm. it felt like a safe space for them. they thought, well, other people have done it — totally. — so i could do it, too.

[music playing] all right. so, dan, can you please kick us off with the first essay you want to talk about? yeah. so this is an essay. it’s called “one bouquet of fleeting beauty, please.” and the writer is named alisha gorder. so this is a story that begins with a young woman working in a flower shop, describing the kinds of customers who come in, the kinds of flower bouquets that they buy, and for what reason. and you think you’re in this light, airy story about a flower shop. and then about halfway through, it takes a plunge into this really troubling back story where her high school boyfriend had died by suicide at age 18. and it throws what she’s talking about and the flower shop into a whole new context. and in the end, it turns into a meditation of, why flowers? why are these the things that people rely on for these important transitions and moments in life? and comes to a wisdom at the end that has just stayed with me ever since. and long-time listeners will remember that this essay was featured on the podcast years ago, back when we had celebrities and voice actors read the essays. let’s hear a part of this one performed, i think, really tenderly by the actor kerry bishé. “there’s a picture i took of him just days before i left for college, two months before he died. it was the summer of chips and guacamole dinners we shared, sitting on the living room floor. he’s standing in the kitchen wearing a white t-shirt and jeans, one perfect half of an avocado cradled in his hand. his face is turned away, hidden from the camera. but i like to think he’s smiling. [music playing] i remember the song we were listening to, the chatter of frogs through the screen door, my bare feet on wood — precious moments made all the more precious by the fact that they have already come and gone. now i measure months by what’s in season — sunflowers in july, dahlias in august, rose hips and maple in october, pine in december, hyacinth in march, crowd-pleasing peonies in may. a favorite of mine is tulip magnolia — the way the buds erupt into blooms and the blooms into a litter of color on lawns, all in a matter of weeks while it’s snowing cherry blossoms. how startlingly beautiful impermanence can be.” you said that it’s that ending and, in fact, it’s that final line that really speaks to you. can you tell me what you learn or take away from that line? it’s sort of grown on me, “how startlingly beautiful impermanence can be.” it’s not that love or connection is beautiful and impermanent. it’s beautiful because it’s impermanent. [laughs] and the fleeting nature of any connection is what makes it precious and what makes it beautiful. and the way that she saw this in petals on the ground that are soon to dry up and go away, but the beauty is in that it won’t last. hmm. i mean, there’s this section, i think, a little bit earlier than that when she even poses the question quite directly, like, why flowers? why do we give these things that are going to shrivel and die? yeah. you have to throw away, yeah. and i love what you’re saying. it’s not despite the impermanence. it’s really loving because of it, because our time is — mm-hmm. that is the arc of life. it’s shortened with flower blossoms. but that is it. it sometimes lasts a long time, sometimes a short time. but it will always feel fleeting in a way, that a level of beauty. what does this essay make you think about in terms of your own life or your own relationships to me, it’s about — i mean, it’s a buzzword we always hear about, but here, it really comes home to roost — is presence as being present. and it’s always the hardest thing for me — for a lot of people — appreciating what you have now and not thinking about what you’re building toward and what you’re accumulating wealth for and what’s to come, but the connections you have now that are beautiful in the moment and not fearing that you’re going to lose them — because you are. that’s a certainty. but just being able to be present and appreciate them, and the fact that it’s this young woman who was able to artfully, in the midst of grief, compose such a beautiful piece that teaches that is just miraculous to me. you mentioned earlier that your dad passed. did you return to this essay then? was it in the back of your mind as you were processing all that? it must have been because i was scrolling through the archive and saw that illustration and clicked on it. and i did see it in a new way. i remembered how much i appreciated it at the time. i was able to hold it together here. [laughs]: but when i read it aloud to a friend, who obviously was sitting there when i was rereading it, i couldn’t get through the final lines. i was really broken up by it. it sounds like this piece resonated with you and spoke to you in a different way years later, which is really powerful. do you want to talk about the next essay? yeah so this one is called “nursing a wound in an appropriate setting.” it’s written by thomas hooven, who is a doctor. he’s not a writer. but you would never know that — no, you would not. — from reading this incredible essay. and i think about this essay all the time. this was published in 2013. he describes his relationship with his long-time girlfriend before he goes to medical school. they knew each other for 12 years. they were both the children of divorce and of unstable households that were scary. and they gave each other a sense of safety. he describes their relationship as being no fighting. fighting was what their parents did. fighting would threaten their equilibrium. yeah. fighting would threaten their love. and so it was a flat, safe relationship. they were together for 12 years. they got engaged. he was about to head off to medical school. and then she abruptly broke up with him. i think there were only a few weeks from their marriage — three. — from their wedding. three weeks. three weeks. [chuckles] wild. and he was just — devastated doesn’t begin to describe it. and he goes off to medical school or his residency, and it’s sort of his boot camp in feelings and complications and devastation and real life, like real life. and then after this time in the wilderness in his residency and going through all this, he learns what real love is. yeah, i mean, his idea of what real love is at the end of the essay is so powerful. this essay was also featured on an early season of the podcast. so here’s jake gyllenhaal reading thomas hooven’s essay “nursing a wound in an appropriate setting.” yeah, this one is so great. “my ex and i are not in touch. our relationship so long in the making and so quick to end was like an ornamental piece of crystal — aesthetically pleasing, but lacking resilience and once shattered, irrecoverable. looking back at the various romantic and not-so-romantic dating experiences i had afterwards, it’s hard to separate my growth as an emotionally conversant partner from my development as a capable physician. both happened simultaneously and gradually through stretches of triumph and sorrow. there were no eureka moments, and neither ever really ended. the turmoil i experienced as an intern left me with a deeper understanding of how pain works, how it feels, how it ebbs, and how it leaves you less naive. i also learned to open up to important facets of life that my previous relationship had locked out — unhappiness, uncertainty, and regret. comfort around feelings like these is crucial in both medicine and intimate relationships. it’s the basis of empathy. i didn’t understand that before my ex left me. and i learned it the hard way. by the time i met my wife, i was a changed man and a real doctor. and our love developed differently from any i had ever experienced before — less like a crystal vase, more like a basketball. our relationship is made for bouncing, for good and sometimes rough play that modern professional lives generate. we do have fights — oh, yes, we do. but they do not threaten our foundation. they deepen it.” tell me what you take away about thomas’s articulation of what real love is. what is he saying? well, this is one of these essays that i feel like mirrored my experience, in a way. like, i didn’t come from a family of turmoil. but i’m afraid of conflict, total fear of conflict. don’t like to fight, don’t like to argue. my idea of a successful, romantic, loving relationship was being in a harmonious space all the time — or not all the time. sometimes you’d be bored, but you wouldn’t be fighting. and so this idea that fighting can bring you closer is revolutionary to me. it still is revolutionary to me in not only that it can bring you closer, but it’s the only thing to bring you closer and the only thing to deepen your relationship. fighting can lead to the end of a relationship, definitely. but the only way forward and the only way deeper is through conflict and resolving conflicts to a new understanding of the relationship and who you’re with and the person you’re with and getting to know them better and all of that. and i don’t know what business he has writing this well about — you’re like, listen — like, it’s not fair to be like a doctor. — you’re already a doctor. i know — and also to be able to write this well about and understand — aw. — love this well and loss and conflict and depth, it’s remarkable. mm. so are you fighting all the time now? no. i still need to learn how to fight better. [music playing] we’ll be right back. [music playing] let’s talk about the final essay. this is an essay by elizabeth fitzsimmons. it’s called “my first lesson in motherhood.” can you tell me what that essay is about? yeah, so this is a piece that ran on mother’s day way back in 2007. and it’s yet another one that takes a really dramatic turn — several dramatic turns. and it’s an essay about bravery when you didn’t think you had the capacity for it. it’s a couple who are having trouble getting pregnant and decide to adopt a baby girl in china. and they specifically fill out forms saying like, we’re new parents. we don’t want any disabilities, any — we can’t deal with anything, basically, [laughs]: except for just a perfect, little, healthy baby. and they get a baby who’s chosen for them by the time they get there and meet with the baby and are alone with her for the first time. they discover alarming physical problems, a really bad rash and a scar at the base of her spine, and hear a horrifying diagnosis that the child will be paralyzed from the waist down, will be incontinent, will have serious, serious problems. and unbelievably, they talk to the agents from the adoption agency, and they say, oh, well, you know, we’re sorry about this, and essentially offer a swap for a different baby. yeah, that’s a moment that is unbelievable in this piece. the view of human life in that circumstance. so this essay was read by the actress connie britton in 2016. and you can just hear the emotional stakes of this story in her performance. let’s listen to it. yeah, she’s really perfect for this one. “i pictured myself boarding the plane with some faceless replacement child and then explaining to friends and family that she wasn’t natalie; that we had left natalie in china because she was too damaged; that the deal had been a healthy baby, and she wasn’t. how could i face myself? how could i ever forget? i would always wonder what happened to natalie. [music playing] i knew this was my test, my life’s worth distilled into a moment. i was shaking my head no before they finished explaining. we didn’t want another baby, i told them. we wanted our baby, the one sleeping right over there. she’s our daughter, i said. we love her. yet we had a long, fraught night ahead wondering how we would possibly cope. i called my mother in tears and told her the news. there was a long pause. ‘oh, honey.’ i sobbed. she waited until i caught my breath. ‘it would be ok if you came home without her.’ ‘why are you saying that?’ ‘i just want to absolve you. what do you want to do?’ ‘i want to take my baby and get out of here,’ i said. ‘good,’ my mother said. ‘then that’s what you should do.’” i mean, i’m tearing up. me, too. so the lesson in this piece to me is about a test. it’s really a test. it’s like, what are you capable of? like, what kind of devotion? what kind of sense of responsibility? what are you going to take on? and they have to decide in the moment, are they going to stick with this child with this horrifying set of health complications that could control their lives forever, or are they going to push that baby aside and accept a healthier baby? and then, how do they live with themselves if they do that? neither choice is an appealing choice. no. this essay — i mean, all of these essays bowled me over, and this one just made me — i mean, i quite literally called my mom after this. it is such a moving [sighs]: testament to just the completely inexplicable, immediate bond between parent and child. yeah, i’m still crying. i mean, it’s remarkable. tell me what you’re taking — i mean, you are a parent. tell me what you’re thinking about when you read this essay. well, first of all, i think anyone reading this thinks, what choice would i have made? of course. and you would like to think that you would make the choice of keeping the child. but honestly, one of the most moving things and tragic things that happened in the wake of publishing this essay is we got emails from people who had faced this choice and — wow. — made the opposite choice and either left with a healthy baby and struggled and struggled and struggled with having done that. more common was giving up on adoption entirely and just walking away, and walking away from that child or any child. but she’s just like, i’m going to walk into this. i’m going to just walk forward into this, and it’s going to be what it’s going to be. and miracle of miracles, within a year or so, all that stuff has gone away. they see a specialist. i know. the kid is fine. i’m going to cry again. it’s like after making this decision, they go home, and she heals. oh. yeah. and she recoiled at thinking that was a reward for making the right choice. she said, it’s not about that. it’s not about, we were generous, or we were good, and therefore, our child turned out fine. it’s not that at all. it just happened that way. but it’s yet another lesson in you can’t predict the smooth path. you just have to walk forward and be brave. i often say with “modern love” stories that are really about choices and hard choices and how it’s ordinary people being incredibly brave, i mean, i often wonder what creates the person who can make the brave choice versus the person who shrinks from it? like, what is that magic sauce? or what is that childhood experience? or what is the parenting that they have? totally. because there is a divide. there is a divide often in those circumstances that we saw in the outpouring after the essay. we see instances of bravery in all three of the essays that you’ve shared today — bravery to embrace the brevity of love, bravery to engage in fighting in a relationship, bravery to make a choice. would you define bravery as like a core act of love? yeah, a core act of love and a core act of life. people’s bravery has been my biggest takeaway over 20 years of doing this work. it’s never a person who says, i am brave. it’s almost the opposite. it’s people who say, i’m not brave. i’m a coward. and yet — totally. — and just the lesson of that, life — it’s going to be a mess one way or the other. you just choose your mess. but that is what it is. that is life. you’re not going to avoid it. there’s such a school of life that is about trying to make your life as clean and tidy as possible. and it’s really a struggle to do that. and i’m not sure it’s well-directed energy. [chuckles] what do you think we should direct our energy to? and now this is just truly me asking you because i want you to give me life advice — if not to cleaning up our life. well, no, i’m not an advice giver, anna. i know, but just please — you should know that. — put on the hat for one second. like, if not to direct our energy towards cleaning up our life in your 20 years of doing this work, what is the more worthwhile thing to direct energy towards? this is not exactly new advice, but it’s really the wisdom from alisha gorder’s essay, which is, be in the moment. value the people you’re with now. don’t think i’m planning for 10 years from now. get your 401(k) out of your mind. contribute to it, but put it out of your mind. it’s the now. it’s the now. that is the work. dan i love that. it’s the now. i feel like so many listeners right now are clinging to every word you’ve said, trying to figure out what you’re looking for in a “modern love” essay pitch. and by the way, you can send those submissions to modernlove@nytimes.com. dan, can you give us a few quick tips on what makes a story stand out in your inbox? well, a bad subject line is “modern love submission.” you’re like 80 percent of people who submit. and a good subject line would include an attempt at a title, which would be like, “please, lord, let him be 27.” please, lord. yeah. i read that subject line. it was funny. it was smart. it was vulnerable. i just prayed the essay would deliver on that promise. and it did deliver. we actually featured it on the podcast a few seasons ago. so a good subject line is very practical advice, but what about the essence of a story? what are you looking for there? harder to define. quality is a sense of humility. there’s a sense that you’re not the smartest person in the world, but you do have something to offer. and in the world of pitching and of trying to get published, there’s an overriding sense that you have to act confident. you have to sell your product. you have to say, this essay is going to be perfect for you. and that’s just the wrong approach. that kind of confidence is not what a hard experience leaves you with. it can leave you shaken. it can leave you wise. but it doesn’t leave you cocky. and i think it’s important that the stories aren’t really about answers. they’re about a search for answers. and they don’t need to come to a conclusion, but they need to present a problem in an interesting way that makes you think about it. well, now you’re going to get even more submissions that can fuel the next 20 years of “modern love.” dan, thank you so much for the conversation today. thanks, anna. that was a lot of fun.

[theme music] from “the new york times,” i’m anna martin. this is “modern love.” this year marks the 20th anniversary of the “modern love” column. 20 years — can you believe that? two decades of essays that have made us laugh, made us gasp, broken our hearts, reminded us of the fundamental goodness of people. and — let’s be honest — a lot of these essays should come with tissues. it’s kind of our thing here — making you cry. to mark this big anniversary, we’ve got a conversation with “modern love” founder daniel jones. dan has edited around 1,000 essays since the first one ran back in 2004. and when you spend all your professional time contemplating human connection, that work doesn’t stay at the office. it impacts you in profound ways. so today, dan shares the three essays that have changed the way he approaches love and relationships in his own life. so it feels strange to say what i say to guests on the show, which is welcome, because, really, you welcomed me into this universe. so instead of saying welcome, i’m going to say, dan jones, hello, and thank you so much. it is great to be back here. the “modern love” column has been around for almost 20 years, which is a long time. and i do not say this in a rude way, but that also means that you are 20 years older than you were when you started it. is there anything that’s happened in your life over those two decades that has changed your approach to the work or reframed it in some way? hmm. i’ve gone from being young to less young over that time. [laughs] delicately put. [laughs] i started the column with children who are now very much adults and have gone through their own breakups and traumas and all of that and got out into the world and gotten jobs. my marriage of 29 years came to an amicable end. my father died, and there’s been a lot of tough family time since then. but i feel like my life was pretty stable during the family child rearing years. and then, oddly timed to the pandemic, i have to say — [laughs] has happened to many, yeah. — it just opened up, and it was like the column was saying to me, ok, you’re going to experience the whole range of what you’ve been putting out there. and interestingly enough, i feel like working on the column for all these years has given me touchstones and tools — and not just for me, for other people, too — to be able to navigate difficult times in life. it feels like this churning reservoir of human experience that feeds into your veins if you are open to it. i love what you said, that you gave so much to the column. and now you’re in this place in your career and your life where it’s giving back to you. i mean, what a — it’s like an annuity program, you know? yeah, it’s like a 401(k). right, right. exactly. it’s like a roth ira. it’s the “modern love” 401(k). that’s a sexy way to say it, right? you know? i’m withdrawing. [gasps]: i’m getting close to the age where i’m going to be forced to withdraw. so that’s a good thing. people are loving this metaphor. yeah. ok, so that’s where you are now. but when you were starting the column, did you see yourself as an expert in relationships or in romance? i wasn’t great at romantic relationships. i was like, how does this work? how does this work? wait — i was really terrible at it in high school. i was really terrible at it in college. mm-hmm. i still found it really hard. i had my first girlfriend in grad school. [laughs]: took you a while. but very slow learning, very shy. but i think just the weightiness of romantic relationships is a scary thing. and i wasn’t paralyzed with fear or anything. i assumed i’d get married and have a family. all those things were just assumptions and didn’t seem all that hard to make happen, in a way. but the complications of relationsh",32002,"for more audio journalism and storytelling,download new york times audio, a new ios app available for news subscribers. while it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. the episode you’re about to hear is from a special series celebrating the 20th anniversary of the “modern love” column. love is stronger than anything you can feel. two decades of essays that have made us laugh, made us gasp, broken our hearts, reminded us of the fundamental goodness of people. it’s kind of our thing here — making you cry. so today, dan shares the three essays that have changed the way he approaches love and relationships in his own life. so it feels strange to say what i say to guests on the show, which is welcome, because, really, you welcomed me into this universe. so instead of saying welcome, i’m going to say, dan jones, hello, and thank you so much. and i do not say this in a rude way, but that also means that you are 20 years older than you were when you started it. is there anything that’s happened in your life over those two decades that has changed your approach to the work or reframed it in some way? i’ve gone from being young to less young over that time.

Why Am I So Tired All the Time?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/well/mind/fatigue-and-sleepiness-causes.html,"ask well chronic exhaustion is pretty common, but it’s also treatable. credit...eric helgas for the new york times supported by byanna gibbs q: i get plenty of sleep, but i’m always tired. what’s going on? figuring out why you’re tired often requires a little detective work, said dr. shannon sullivan, a sleep medicine specialist at stanford university. on the one hand, your sleep routine might just need a few tweaks. but certain health conditions or medications could also be to blame. the good news, dr. sullivan said, is there are ways to identify and treat the source of your fatigue, which can often help you feel better. “it’s a part of medicine with a great deal of hope,” she said. the first thing you should do isreview your sleep habits, dr. sullivan said. have you recently strayed from your normal sleep schedule? have you been stressed? if not, your sleep routine might need some sprucing. make sure you’re getting at least seven hours of sleep every night (some people need more) and try to go to bed and wake up at the same times every day. much like a toddler’s naps, your own sleep will be better when it’s consistent, dr. sullivan said. if you have a regular afternoon coffee or an evening glass of wine, try skipping it. and avoid scrolling on your phone or snacking just before bed. all of these activities can lower the quality of your sleep. thetiming of your mealscan make a difference, too; aim to finish dinner at least two to three hours before bedtime.

[did you recently buy a home? we want to hear from you. email:thehunt@nytimes.com] it was, in part, a question of background. while ms. andorfer, 33, had mostly grown up in big cities (pittsburgh and baltimore) and attended college in chicago, mr. croton, 32, was a product of santa barbara, calif., and its rambling ambience. “santa barbara has that kind of ‘small city, large town’ thing going on,” he said. “it’s very beautiful, lots of outdoor stuff, but also lots of amenities and restaurants and fun things to do.” mr. croton was warmer to the idea of leaving san francisco, where the couple met in law school. both of their jobs as attorneys were in the bay area, though each could telecommute several days a week, leaving room to imagine a different way of living. and ms. andorfer was somewhat surprised to find how much she looked forward to their getaways, especially to the town of sonoma, a foodie haven with 11,000 residents set in the vibrant heart of sonoma valley wine country. “i very quickly could see myself living there,” she said. “it doesn’t have city vibes, but it has restaurants and culture — a lot of things going on. i love to cook and i’m in a bunch of wine clubs, including several right in that area.” it was ms. andorfer who suggested visiting some open houses in sonoma — “just for fun,” she said. mr. croton added a wrinkle when he proposed including marin county, about 30 miles south of sonoma, with its coveted combination of rural feel and higher-end amenities. at an open house in marin county, the couple met kristen perry, an agent with the kristie martinelli team at coldwell banker who previously was an executive at several tech startups. “it’s always interesting when people leave the city,” ms. perry said. “some take a very long time to get to the point of actually being ready to move. but alex and george moved very quickly once they realized that they felt pretty sure about it.” the couple scouted open houses for weeks, looking for a place with an airy feel and distinctive architecture. they hoped to remain within walking distance of shops and services, as they were in san francisco, and wanted either a big yard or park access for their pets. with some help from mr. croton’s mother for a down payment, they capped their budget at $1.35 million. among their options: no. 1 three-bedroom ranch in sonoma this three-bedroom, two-bath house in sonoma, built in 1979, had a beautifully updated kitchen and lots of natural light. its 1,833 square feet, finished with bamboo flooring and plantation shutters, sat on nearly a quarter acre. there was an attached two-car garage, and an expansive deck and garden shed took up much of the backyard. the house sat on one of sonoma’s main streets, necessitating a fully fenced front yard. the road noise bothered mr. croton more than it did ms. andorfer. it was listed at $949,000, with estimated annual taxes of $11,000. no. 2 woodsy a-frame in marin county set on a narrow road in the fairfax hills, this updated two-bedroom, two-bath 1967 house with vaulted ceilings and skylights backed up to forest, creek and hiking trails in marin county’s cascade canyon preserve. a chef’s kitchen and big skylights made it feel bigger than its 1,572 square feet, and the couple loved the glass doors that opened out to a big back deck surrounded by old-growth trees and views of the hills. there was virtually no storage (it had a carport but no garage), and the home’s tucked-in location meant longer drives to the city than its location suggested. it was priced at $1.195 million, with estimated annual taxes of $10,000. no. 3 walk down the hill to sonoma this 1,915-square-foot house in sonoma had three bedrooms, three bathrooms and an open-plan living area. the living room, which had vaulted ceilings, opened onto a wraparound deck with custom shading and forever views of the sonoma valley. perched near the top of a narrow road of residences, it felt a bit isolated, yet ms. andorfer found a coffee shop and other amenities within a few minutes’ walk down the hill. built in 1978, the house needed some upgrades, including backyard fencing, new kitchen appliances and, most pressing, a new roof. there was an attached two-car garage. it was listed for $995,000, with estimated annual taxes of $9,500. find out what happened next by answering these two questions: which would you choose?

A Guy I Know Had a Liver Transplant. Now He’s Boozing Again.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/magazine/liver-transplant-alcohol-ethics.html,"advertisement subscriber-onlynewsletter the magazine’s ethicist columnist on how to support someone with an addiction problem. bykwame anthony appiah my significant other has a friend who is a longtime alcoholic, while also being intelligent, entertaining and conniving. for example, he used to tell his wife he was going to the gym and then head to the bar; before returning home, he’d dampen his clothes in the bathroom to make it seem as if he’d gotten a good sweat on. he was off the radar for a bit, and then we learned he had a liver transplant. after that, he had an episode of hepatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder caused by liver dysfunction. it seems the doctors knew he was still drinking but gave him the new liver anyway and counseled abstinence. a few parties later, he was sneaking vodka, gin and whatever else was around. he lies to everyone and has made his guy friends vow not to tell his wife about his drinking. they’ve made a meager attempt to confront him, only to be assured that he just fell off the wagon and would be good. just don’t tell the wife! i’m appalled that they’re going along with this. there are a couple of ethical issues here. first, who should decide whether someone is entitled to a transplant? some hospital systems deny a liver transplant to patients who continue to drink alcohol, and other hospitals don’t. second, do the friends have an obligation to tell this man’s wife that he’s still drinking? she could insist he leave the house and go to rehab, in which case he might have a chance of living long enough to see his children get married. some additional context: a friend of mine died waiting for a liver transplant. i am also the child of a lifelong alcoholic.— name withheld from the ethicist: there’s more than one morally defensible way of allocating donor organs. in the united states, as in western europe, the system emphasizes equity and basically gives priority to patients with the greatest need. an approach that focused instead on efficiency — on getting the maximum use out of donated livers, as measured by ‘‘quality-adjusted life years’’ — might give an edge to people who were younger and otherwise healthier and might work against low-income and minority populations. organ allocation in the united states is governed by the organ procurement and transplantation network (o.p.t.n.), whose policies determine the order in which deceased-donor organs are offered; they do not, however, dictate medical practice. so it’s up to a medical center to decide whether or not transplant candidates with alcohol-related liver disease are to abstain from alcohol for some period — six months having long been a typical sobriety window. some studies indicate that carefully selected patients who aren’t subject to a sobriety window can do just as well as those who are (though the data is hard to interpret because of the ‘‘carefully selected’’ part). and if your drinking has caused a severe case of acute hepatitis that doesn’t respond to medical treatment, you probably won’t survive a six-month waiting period. so the trend seems to be away from requiring an extended interval of abstinence. the point is that the current system for allocating this scarce resource is morally legitimate, whatever trade-offs it may entail; its architects are perfectly aware that many liver recipients will not succeed in refraining from heavy drinking afterward. the fact that this longtime alcoholic has returned to his old habits is distressing. it doesn’t mean that the system isn’t functioning the way it’s meant to. one thing that transplant centers may try to determine is whether patients with an alcohol problem have social networks that could help them stay sober. this brings us to your second question. this fellow’s friends weren’t looking after him when they agreed to uphold this boozy bro code and keep mum. he doesn’t want to die, but he’s drinking himself to death, which means that, at least in this key area, he lacks the capacity for rational decision-making. in a situation like that, it’s more important to attend to his interests than to respect his autonomy. if there’s a chance that his life can be extended by successful management of his alcoholism, and if discussing the problem with his wife will help, thoughtful friends would do just that.

atlanta might well respond, “bless their hearts.” the de facto capital of the american south moves with too much muscle and speed to be bothered by such quaint notions, secure in its position as a nexus of civil rights history, capitalist hustle, black creativity, and (thanks to generous state tax credits) tv and film production. beyond the traffic-choked highways, atlanta’s older, more central neighborhoods actually offer abundant charm, thrumming with dining, nightlife and art. a key catalyst has been theatlanta beltline, the partly constructed 22-mile walking and biking path that has connected old parts of town in fresh ways, spurring revitalization and giving locals and visitors alike a place to enjoy the city outside their cars. atlanta’s spiritual mission is spelled out in the civil rights landmarks along auburn avenue, the historic black business corridor just east of downtown where the rev. dr. martin luther king jr. grew up and later preached. start at the old brick chapel ofebenezer baptist church, which is overseen by the national park service (free admission). find a seat in the pews, close your eyes and listen to recordings of king’s sermons from the 1960s that play on the sound system. walk a minute east to see the crypts of king and his wife, coretta scott king, before continuing past an elegant stretch of queen anne-style houses, among them m.l.k.’s birth home (currently closed for renovation). end your walk with a fresh-fruit cup (from about $5) fromlottafrutta, auburn avenue’s beloved pan-latin frutería. southern national the atlanta braves’2013 decision to leavethe struggling summerhill neighborhood, just south of downtown, for a new stadium in the suburbs was met with lusty boos by city dwellers. since then, however, all kinds

avenue,harold’s chicken & ice bar,a popular spot for gizzards and giblets, becomes a joyous, bumping dance club on weekend nights, attracting a crowd of 20- to 40-somethings. usually at the controls on fridays is chris marks, who spins records under the monikercm the dj. atlanta hip-hop has evolved to contain multitudes — by turns socially conscious, psychedelic, ruminative, daring andjust plain

eastside trail the busiest stretch of the beltline,the eastside trail, begins at the krog tunnel and extends about two and a half miles north to the lovely green slopes ofpiedmont park. the beltline has been transformative for a city that for decades wasorganized around the car. and though its success has promptedserious concernsabout gentrification, it seems that atlanta, finally, can see itself, particularly on weekends, when the path is crammed with flirting teenagers, exercise freaks, extrovert roller skaters, buskers and cool kids rocking complicated sneakers from the future.

finster, the georgia preacher whose idiosyncratic, funny and dreamlike work has beenchampionedby the athens, ga., rock band r.e.m., among others. in the last few years, the high has taken special care to feature black art, reinforcing atlanta’s reputation as a center of black expression and ideas. current shows includea photo exhibitionfrom tyler mitchell, the first black artist to shoot the cover

What if Charity Shouldn’t Be Optimized?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/business/charity-holiday-giving-optimized.html,"the recent trend in philanthropy has been to look for the most bang for your buck. maybe you don’t have to. credit...photo illustration by jack smyth supported by byemma goldberg equipped with tools to measure our calories, steps, working hours, wasted hours, water intake and sleep cycles, we have now been exhorted to measure our charitable impact, too.books,podcasts,tiktoksanddigital guidesimplore us to donate our money cautiously, rationally, to the charities that promise to make a dollar go the furthest it can. holiday season giving can start to feel a little like sports betting: it doesn’t matter if you’re loyal to a scrappy local team — the data can tell you exactly where your money should go. this is not how i thought about charity when i was growing up. i remember my childhood neighbor declaring that when he rode the subway he sometimes found himself spending more than he would on a cab, because he did not believe in toughening his heart toward people asking for change. this seemed like an approach that made up for impracticality with grace: when someone in front of you says they need help, do not look away. what is the right way to give away money, anyway? the debate has been fomented partly by a group of billionaires — most prominently the facebook co-founder dustin moskovitz and his wife, cari tuna — whose approach to charity argues, essentially, that you do not get to feel good for having done anything at all. people should give wherever their money is most needed and most likely to yield the biggest effects. mr. moskowitz and ms. tuna are among the silicon valley billionaires who have embraced the philosophical movement known as effective altruism, a worldview that focuses on optimizing good. elon musk, a founder of tesla and spacex,said effective altruist thinkingclosely aligned with his views. the co-founder of skype,jaan tallinn, also supported the movement, and former board members of openai had ties to it as well. for billionaires who made their money by crunching numbers, effective altruism extends that into the way they give away their money, too. it is a data-loving engineer’s mode of do-gooding, for the first generation of ultra wealth created by engineers it’s an approach that can give people moral permission to keep amassing more wealth — as long as they give some of it away. e.a. fits comfortably into an era of widening inequality, as the fortunes of the world’s richest have grown, and so has their ability to shape ideas for the rest of us. e.a. applied the sheen of good will (altruism) to a brand of thinking (optimization) that had already taken over the way weeatandexercise, work and live. and just as health optimization began as a tech-world obsession that trickled down to the rest of us, something similar has happened in recent years with the ethos of effective altruism and americans’ sensibility around charitable giving. hello! i'm wondering: how do you decide where to donate money? did reading this article give you any new ideas to consider? @emma goldberg, yes! this article gave us much to think about. in my family, we are not wealthy but comfortable, and our own lives have benefited greatly from many nonprofit organizations - especially those with missions relating to religion, arts, and education. so it's easy and natural for us to support those organizations. we don't need to see a rating, because we've seen the results of their work with our own eyes. perhaps there are many who either don't attend anything run by a non-profit, or don't realize they do, so they think giving is only about stereotypical poor people in a faraway place. i like that you offer options for a more balanced approach. i live around the poverty level so have little money to give to charity. i am very thoughtful of how i spend the money i do have. i do not want to add harm to the world by the way i spend money thereby necessitating charity. i try to ""first do no harm.""as examples:i have a small ira. i choose the funds and companies that are not polluting industries or harm animals, the ones that pay living wages. i check as we sow for suggestions of ethical investing.i buy and eat food that has been grown organically, and regenerative when i can find it. i only eat pasture raised meat and eggs because i don't want the animals to suffer. i feel i'd be ingesting that suffering if i were to eat them. i buy fair trade chocolate and tea.i recently purchased a sofa and took my time buying it. i purchased one that had been made in north carolina by workers paid living wages. it also didn't out-gas harmful chemicals and was made with forest stewardship council certified wood.i recently replaced my really old car with a ev. i love it because it is so quiet and does not contribute to the smog of my city.i wear clothes as long as they are presentable, then wear them in my yard planting native flowers for the pollinators and birds. then i turn them into rags to clean the house.can i do better? yes. but striving to live causing as little harm as possible gives me great joy and satisfaction. even if i can't cut a big check to the local humane society or women's shelter each christmas. @emma goldberg thank you for this article. i give to a range of organizations, some that have changed the arc of my life and my family’s, some that envision a world that is livable for everyone, and some that add cultural value that makes the livable life worth living. i feel fortunate to be able to give across this spectrum, and would never shame anyone for giving in a modest or values driven way, unlike the implicit criticism that ea adherents level at the rest of us. @emma goldberg opening with a caveat - i'm a nonprofit fundraiser at a relatively large organization. but i prefer to donate to small, community-based nonprofits, parks/botanic gardens, and museums primarily because i know from experience that these organizations often have the hardest time quantifying their impact. solid data practices require resources that are out of reach or impractical for many of these organizations. my choices as a donor, nonprofit decision-maker, and fundraiser are informed by another philanthropic school of thought: community-centric fundraising, which is also an equity-based framework. the difference is that it denounces more data-centric modes of giving as inherently harmful to scrappy but impactful community-based organizations, particularly those run by, and for, members of historically marginalized communities. it also embraces time/volunteerism, connections within the community, and resource-sharing among nonprofits and other local organizations as ways to give and make a difference. it's interesting that two opposite movements are both based on genuine concern for social justice.

A Hanukkah-Ready Recipe That Does Everything Right,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/dining/hanukkah-recipe.html,"holidayrecipes  by inspired by a ukrainian cafe and a mother-in-law’s classic, this take on kasha varnishkes is rich with caramelized onions. byjoan nathan when my daughter daniela returned from a work trip to eastern europe last summer, she raved about the kasha varnishkes at kafe jerusalem, a tiny ashkenazic jewish restaurant in lviv, ukraine. according to her, it was even better than mine. i pride myself on my recipe, having learned it from my mother-in-law paula, a kasha varnishkes maven who grew up not far from lviv, so i found this news perturbing, to say the least. paula’s version was a simple yet ethereal mixture of caramelized onions; kasha, the hulled groats of buckwheat berries; and varnishkes, one of several yiddish words for noodles. but often, the dish is bland, lacking in onions with buckwheat that’s too finely ground. curious to know what made kafe jerusalem’s kasha varnishkes so special, i contacted marianna dushar, a food anthropologist in lviv who focuses on the food of galicia, which covers parts of western ukraine and southern poland. “first and foremost, it’s all about the kasha,” ms. dushar wrote in an email, translating for the restaurant’s chef-owner, lola landa. around 1880, long before my in-laws came to the united states in 1950, a large wave of jewish immigrants from eastern europe brought kasha varnishkes to the lower east side. mostbought their stone-ground buckwheat fromwolff’s, long the go-to for the grain. since the 1930s, birkett mills has milled wolff’s buckwheat in its an 18th-century grist mill in penn yan, n.y.,where it thrived in the region’s eastern europe-like climate.

international recognition. vivian yeeandmatthew mpoke bigg maneuvering for the future of syria intensified on monday after its new leaders met with foreign diplomats, and its ousted former president, bashar al-assad, said in what appeared to be his first public remarks since fleeing the country that he had wanted to stay and fight. in thestatement, issued monday on social media accounts he used while in office, mr. al-assad said he had been evacuated to russia after rebel forces infiltrated damascus, the capital, just over a week ago. he also criticized the rebel alliance that has formed the country’s new leadership, as the kremlin acknowledged that the fate of the critical russian bases in syria was uncertain. tass, the russian state news agency, also reported mr. al-assad’s statement, which said it had been issued from moscow. the statement later appeared to have been removed from one of the social media accounts of the former syrian presidency. here’s what else to know: assad statement:mr. al-assadsaid in the statementthat he did not “consider stepping down or seeking refuge” as the rebels advanced, and that he had remained in damascus, until dec. 8, when, he said, fighters moved in. coordinating with “our russian allies,” mr. al-assad said he then headed to the coastal city of latakia, near where russia operates a military base. syria diplomacy:as the world

people remained “unshaken.” anton troianovski syria went unmentioned in an hourlong televised meeting that president vladimir v. putin held with the russian military’s top brass on monday. putin has yet to comment on syria since his ally bashar al-assad’s fall, and his continued silence is a sign that the kremlin is still struggling to determine what its future military presence in syria will be.

but had wanted to stay and fight, according to a statement that was posted on monday to social media accounts he used while in office and reported by russian state news media. the statement, which said it had been issued from moscow, contained what appeared to be the first public comments from mr. al-assad since his government was overthrown just over a week ago. in it, he defended his record during the country’s long and brutal civil war, criticized the country’s new leadership and gave details of his flight from syria. the russian state news agency, tass, reported news of the statement on its website on monday. mr. al-assad said that he had not planned to leave the country, and said he did not “consider stepping down or seeking refuge” as the rebels advanced. he said he had remained in damascus, the capital, “carrying out my duties” until early on dec. 8, when, he said, rebels began to infiltrate the city. at that point, he moved “in coordination with our russian allies” to the syrian coastal city of latakia, and later arrived at russia’s hmeimim air base nearby, he said. “as the field situation in the area continued to deteriorate, the russian military base itself came under intensified attack by drone strikes. with no viable means of leaving the base, moscow requested that the base’s command arrange an immediate evacuation to russia on the evening of sunday dec. 8,” mr. al-assad said in the statement, which was published in english. this account of the episode could not be independently confirmed. the kremlin has said that mr. al-assad made the “personal decision” to leave office and that president vladimir v. putin had offered exile to him and his family. dmitri s. peskov, the kremlin spokesman, has saidmoscow will not disclose detailsof mr.

al-assad’s governmentover a week ago, syrians have begun to reckon with thenetwork of prisons, police stations and torture chambers that were central to his family’s brutal rule, and the abuses of the past 13 years, after the failed rebel uprising and subsequent civil war.death tollestimates from the conflict are as high as 620,000, in a country with a prewar population of 22 million. mr. al-assad’s arrival in russia has effectively put him out of the reach ofinternational justice, human rights advocates have said. in the statement, mr. assad offered a defense of his record in office, saying he had “refused to barter the salvation of his nation for personal gain.” mr. al-assad, who at times in the one-page statement referred to himself in the third person, also did not mention any plans for his future, and said that his bond with syria and its people remained “unshaken.” “when the state falls into the hands of terrorism and the ability to make a meaningful contribution is lost any position becomes void of purpose,” he said, in an apparent attempt to provide a larger explanation for his departure. there was no immediate public response to the statement from syria’s new transitional government. advertisement vivian yee reporting from cairo a little more than a week after overthrowing the longtime syrian leader bashar al-assad, the rebel alliance that took power in syria was making rapid progress toward international recognition of its legitimacy as its officials began to receive diplomats from the united nations, the middle east and europe. the leader of therebel coalition, ahmed al-shara, met on sunday with the united nations special envoy to syria, geir o. pedersen, and they discussed the unfolding political transition, according to a message on telegram posted by the coalition. mr. al-shara, better known by his nom de guerre, abu mohammad al-jolani, “stressed the importance of rapid and effective cooperation” to rebuild syria, develop its economy and maintain syria as a unified territory, the telegram post said. speaking to reporters on his arrival in the syrian capital, damascus, mr. pedersensaidmany challenges lay ahead for syria and called for increased aid to assist with the country’s humanitarian crisis. kaja kallas, the european union’s foreign policy chief,told reporterson monday that she had sent the “european top diplomat in syria” to meet with the new government in damascus. the european union is the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to syria through u.n. agencies, making the relationship with brussels a crucial one. france’s foreign ministry said on sunday that a team of diplomats would travel to syria on tuesday. and turkey and qatar, which were in contact with the rebels well before the surprise offensive that rocketed them from obscurity in syria’s northwest to control of nearly the entire country, were both reopening their embassies in damascus. since mr. al-assad fled the advancing rebels on dec. 8, the rest of the world has had to reckon with a sudden new reality in syria: a country where nearly 14 years of civil war had left mr. al-assad in seemingly firm control was now in the hands of a conservative islamist group,hayat tahrir al-sham, that the united nations, the united states, turkey and many other countries had long designated as a terrorist organization for its early ties to al qaeda and the islamic state. arab countries had for years been moving towardnormalizing relationswith mr. al-assad, despite his brutal treatment of his people, and western countries, while hitting him with heavy sanctions, had grudgingly come to accept that he was there to stay. his overthrow scrambled that calculus, forcing foreign powers to decide how to deal with a largely unknown quantity that many of them had shunned as extremists for years. many of those powers, including the united states, european countries and turkey, say they want to see a stable, unified syria with an inclusive government that respects the rights of syria’s minorities, including shiite muslims, druse, christians of various sects and alawites, the shiite offshoot sect that the assad family and many of its strongest supporters belongs to. foreign countries have the leverage to push syria’s new leadership toward that vision. to unlock greater flows of humanitarian aid, get suffocating economic sanctions lifted and earn international legitimacy — all required for a crippled, impoverished syria to stabilize and rebuild — hayat tahrir al-sham will need other countries to remove its designation as a terrorist group. ms. kallas hassaidthat the european union will not lift sanctions on syria until its new leadership shows it will protect minorities and women’s rights and disavow extremism. on monday, she told reporters that european foreign ministers meeting in brussels would discuss “how we engage with the new leadership of syria and on what level we engage the leadership and, of course, what more steps are we willing to take if we see that syria goes to the right direction.” individual european countries were also gradually reaching out to damascus. italy, which has maintained a diplomatic presence in the syrian capital since 2018, was the first to engage on the ground. its ambassador was the only european representative in a meeting the syrian transitional administration held last week with several arab ambassadors, according to italy’s foreign ministry. jean-noël barrot, france’s foreign minister,told france inter radioon sunday that a team of four french diplomats would head to syria on tuesday for the first time since 2012, when france and many other countries broke with mr. al-assad over the bloody crackdown on peaceful antigovernment protesters that instigated the civil war. mr. barrot said the main goals were to establish first contact with the syrian authorities there and to evaluate the needs of the syrian population. “but also to verify whether or not the initial statements made by this new authority — which were rather encouraging, which called for calm, which apparently did not commit any abuses — are actually being followed up on the ground,” mr. barrot added. the quickening diplomatic engagement reflected the winners and losers in the new syria. russia, a key ally of mr. al-assad, said over the weekend that it had evacuated some staff members from its embassy in damascus, though the embassy confirmed that its ambassador was staying. but turkey, which has long hadtacit linksto hayat tahrir al-sham and has emerged as an important go-between for the group and other foreign governments, raised its flag over its embassy in damascus on saturday for the first time in 12 years. and qatar, which like turkey has maintained a relationship with the group and supports islamist groups around the middle east, likewise sent a diplomatic delegation to syria to reopen its embassy there, its foreign ministry said in aposton x on sunday evening. mr. al-shara, who has long craved international legitimacy for hayat tahrir al-sham, appears attuned to concerns about whether his group is ready to lead. according to the telegram post announcing his meeting with mr. pedersen, he said it would be important to secure economic and political support for creating a safe environment for the millions of syrian refugees in the middle east, europe and elsewhere to return. “leader al-shara pointed out the need to implement these steps with great care and high precision without haste and under the supervision of specialized teams, so that they are achieved in the best possible way,” it said. aurelien breedencontributed reporting from paris;emma bubolafrom rome;jacob roubaifrom beirut, lebanon; and natalia vasilyeva from istanbul. euan ward israel carried out a heavy wave of airstrikes overnight on syria’s coastal region, a war monitor said early on monday, as the israeli military continued to pound syria in a bid to destroy the country’s military assets after rebels seized power. the overnight strikestargetedformer syrian army positions including air defense sites and missile warehouses, according to the war monitor, the syrian observatory for human rights, an organization based in britain that has long tracked the conflict in syria. earlier in the day, an israeli airstrike also targeted radars in deir al-zour’s military airport in the country’s east, the observatorysaid. the “successive strikes” along the syrian coast —home to russian naval bases— amounted to “the most violent strikes in the area” since 2012, according to the observatory. it said there were 18 airstrikes, which were particularly powerful because they were consecutive and detonated missiles in warehouses, leading to secondary explosions. the israeli military declined to comment on the strikes. israeli officials have previously said that the campaign in syria is an effort to keep military equipment out of the hands of “extremists,” after an alliance of rebel groups ousted the assad regime earlier this month. there were no immediate reports of casualties from the latest strikes, the observatory said. israel has struck syria more than 450 times since the collapse of the assad government, according to the observatory,destroying syria’s navyand dozens of air bases, ammunition depots and other military equipment. israel’s militaryhas also seizedand occupied an expanse of territory in syria over the de facto border between the two countries, including on the syrian side of the strategic mt. hermon. israel has given no timeline for its departure, apart from saying thatit would stayuntil its security demands were met. on sunday, the israeli government unanimously approved plans by prime minister benjamin netanyahu to expand settlements in the israeli-occupied golan heights, part of an $11 million scheme to double the population in the area. the move was necessary, the prime minister’s office said, because a “new front” had opened up on israel’s border with syria after the fall of the assad government. israel seized the golan heights during the arab-israeli war of 1967 and it is considered illegally occupied under international law. the head of the group leading the rebel coalition that now governs syria, ahmed al-shara, said in an interview on saturday with syria tv, a pro-opposition channel, that israel was using pretexts to justify “unwarranted” territorial seizures in syria. still, he said, syria could not afford any further conflict and was instead focused on diplomatic solutions. “syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations,” mr. al-shara said. “the priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not being drawn into disputes that could lead to further destruction.” gabby sobelmanandvivian yeecontributed reporting. advertisement lara jakes lara jakes writes about global conflicts and diplomacy. the 13-year civil war between syria’s government and rebel fighters has ended. but the peril is not over for syria’s kurdish minority. a number ofarmed factions are still jostling for controlafter the collapse of the assad regime. they include the kurdish-led syrian democratic forces, which have allied with the united states to combat the extremist islamic state, and the syrian national army, a militia backed by turkey, which is hostile to the kurdish forces. for more than a decade, the kurdish-led soldiers have been america’s most reliablepartner in syria, liberating cities seized by the extremist group and detaining around 9,000 of its fighters. but turkey, which shares a border with syria, has long considered the kurdish group to be its enemy. the turkish government believes the kurdish fighters in syria are allied with the separatist kurdistan workers’ party, or p.k.k., which has fought the turkish state for decades. presidentrecep tayyip erdoganof turkey, who backs the rebel groups that toppled the assad regime, appears eager to seize the opportunity created by the momentous political shift in syria to pursue his own agenda against the kurdish fighters. the shape of the new syrian government, led by the islamist group hayat tahrir al-sham, is still being determined. but american officials and middle east analysts agree:turkey will have an outsized influence. that means kurdish groups’ foothold in the northeast looks increasingly “tenuous,” said wa’el alzayat, a syria expert and former american diplomat. turkey “will have the biggest leverage in what’s happening, and will happen, in syria for the foreseeable future,” he said. as hayat tahrir al-sham and its allies seized control from president bashar al-assad, “they brought with them a tide of turkish power and influence over the future of syria,” said nicholas heras, a senior analyst at the new lines institute. the high stakes for the kurds, and for western forces determined to prevent a renewed isis threat, were illuminated earlier this past week. even as hayat tahrir al-sham and its allies took over,turkish-backed rebels attacked the syrian democratic forces, supported by turkish airstrikes and artillery fire. the commander of the syrian democratic forces, gen.mazloum abdi, told the new york timeshe had to divert fighters who were defending the prisons that house accused isis members to fight off the turkish-backed militants. now, mr. heras predicted, arabs who had joined the syrian democratic forces to fight the islamic state could disband or defect to other rebel groups, under pressure from turkey and hayat tahrir al-sham. that would further weaken the kurdish forces. a best-case scenario for the kurds, officials and experts said, might see them receive enough support from the united states to secure the territory they hold in northeast syria. that could give them leverage with the new government in damascus to pursue a fully autonomous state, something minority kurds in syria have long sought. at worst, the kurds could face an inflamed conflict with turkish-backed fighters, be forced to cede control of at least some of their oil-rich territory and, if president-elect donald j. trump decides to withdraw u.s. troops, lose vital help on the ground. “there really needs to be some kind of cease-fire/peace agreement between the turks and the kurds that both sides can agree with,” said natasha hall, a syria expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington. the biden administration is racing to negotiate just that before it leaves office next month. following meetings in turkey last week, secretary of state antony j. blinken said on saturday that “making sure that isis was in a box” remained an urgent priority in syria. he said the kurdish fighters were “playing a critical role in pursuing that mission.” but the diplomatic balancing act he faced was clear: his meetings in turkey included talks with the foreign minister, hakan fidan, who earlier last week said that “any p.k.k. extension in syria cannot be considered a legitimate partner.” and on friday, mr. fidan pointedly cited the p.k.k. as he described efforts to keep terrorist organizations from exploiting the political chaos in syria. yet there are signs that american diplomacy is having an impact. last week, an american commander, gen. michael e. kurilla,visited northeast syria, where 900 american troops are stationed. hours later, a cease-fire between the kurdish forces and a turkish-backed rebel group known as the syrian national army was announced in the northern city of manbij, where the two sides have frequently clashed. general abdi, the kurdish commander,said on xthat the cease-fire was brokered with american help. under the agreement, he said, kurdish forces would withdraw from manbij, a majority arab city which they seized from the islamic state in 2016 but that hassince become a flashpointamong battling factions for control. but he and other syrian ethnic kurds are increasingly worried that their retreat from manbij is just the beginning. last tuesday, a senior hayat tahrir al-sham officer said thatlocal tribes allied with his grouphad wrested control of the eastern city of deir al-zour from kurdish fighters who had taken over asmr. al-assad’s forces collapsedjust days earlier. and in the days since, the turkish-backed rebels have repeatedly battled with kurdish forces in the region around the euphrates river. mr. heras, the new lines analyst, said he thought those skirmishes could be military preparations for an invasion of kobani, a majority kurdish city. the city, just south of the turkish border, holds deep emotional significance for the kurdish forces, who fought with american troops toreclaim itafter a four-month islamic state siege that began in late 2015. general abdi now appears to bebracing for a possible invasionby turkey’s allied fighters. mr. heras said residents were fleeing kobani by the thousands despite a shaky truce agreement this past week that aimed to buy time for negotiations. “turkey is taking advantage of the crisis in syria to destabilize the region and seize our land, while claiming they are fighting terrorists,” said sinam sherkany mohamad, the head of the kurdish fighters’ political wing in washington, in a statement. “but we are not terrorists, we are democratic u.s. allies.” james f. jeffrey, a former american ambassador to turkey who was a chief syria envoy during mr. trump’s first administration, said any invasion of kobani would violate a 2019 agreement that the u.s. negotiated for a détente, “and whether by the turks, or syrian forces associated with the turks, it makes no difference.” in the meantime, general abdi has sought to shore up the kurdish fighters’ relationship with hayat tahrir al-sham, sayinghe is seeking direct relationswith the group’s leaders. officials and experts said turkey may wait until its interests are locked in with the new syrian government before deciding whether to launch a full-bore military offensive against the kurdish forces. it may also watch to see whether mr. trump withdraws american troops, and how his administration deals with mr. erdogan, a like-minded strongman whose relationship with the united states hasoften been tempestuous. senator lindsey graham, republican of south carolina, warned in astatementon social media that he was prepared to push for economic sanctions against turkey if it attacked the kurdish forces, which he said would “set in motion an isis jailbreak.” he added: “if turkey takes military action against kurdish forces in syria, it will jeopardize america’s interests dramatically.” safak timurcontributed reporting from istanbul.

al-zour’s military airport in the country’s east, the observatorysaid. the “successive strikes” along the syrian coast —home to russian naval bases— amounted to “the most violent strikes in the area” since 2012, according to the observatory. it said there were 18 airstrikes, which were particularly powerful because they were consecutive and detonated missiles in warehouses, leading to secondary explosions. the israeli military declined to comment on the strikes. israeli officials have previously said that the campaign in syria is an effort to keep military equipment out of the hands of “extremists,” after an alliance of rebel groups ousted the assad regime earlier this month. there were no immediate reports of casualties from the latest strikes, the observatory said. israel has struck syria more than 450 times since the collapse of the assad government, according to the observatory,destroying syria’s navyand dozens of air bases, ammunition depots and other military

benjamin netanyahu to expand settlements in the israeli-occupied golan heights, part of an $11 million scheme to double the population in the area. the move was necessary, the prime minister’s office said, because a “new front” had opened up on israel’s border with syria after the fall of the assad government. israel seized the golan heights during the arab-israeli war of 1967 and it is considered illegally occupied under international law. the head of the group leading the rebel coalition that now governs syria, ahmed al-shara, said in an interview on saturday with syria tv, a pro-opposition

solutions. “syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations,” mr. al-shara said. “the priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not

Stokes blow compounds England slide towards defeat,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cdxzlr1790xo,"third test, hamilton (day three of five)new zealand 347(santner 76; potts 4-90)&

against new zealand was compounded by a concerning recurrence of ben stokes' hamstring injury.stokes was in visible distress as he left the field clutching the same left hamstring he injured in august, subsequently missing four tests.the captain was bowling his third over of the third day, midway through the afternoon session. he pulled up in the follow-through of his second delivery, went straight to the dressing room and did not return for the remainder of the new zealand second innings. the all-rounder will have a scan overnight.even before stokes was injured, england were staring down the barrel as an inevitable kane williamson century built new zealand's monstrous lead.after rain delayed play by two and a half hours, williamson moved to 156. he added 107 with rachin ravindra, who made 44, and another 92 with daryl mitchell, who helped himself to 60.when new zealand were finally bowled out for 453, england's target was a world-record and improbable 658.england were left six overs to bat, in which time ben duckett played an awful hack to drag on off the retiring tim southee and zak crawley was lbw to his tormentor matt henry.the tourists will resume on 18-2 when play gets under way at the earlier time of 10:30 (21:30 gmt monday) on day four.dry weather is forecast for days four and five, giving new zealand plenty of time to salvage a consolation victory from a series england have already won.for england, the bigger worry is stokes' fitness. this is a devastating blow for stokes, whose progress from left-knee surgery at the end of last year has now been hit by two hamstring injuries in the space of five months.the first, sustained playing for northern superchargers in the hundred, ruled him out of the home series against sri lanka and first test in pakistan. stokes later admitted the mental toll the battle to get fit in pakistan took on him, made worse by a break-in at his home while he was away.the captain has looked near to his best in new zealand, the country of his birth, both as a leader and a player.the 33-year-old had been able to play a full role as a fourth seamer, but it is the repeat injury after such a bowling workload that is the cause for alarm.the 23 overs he bowled on the first day of this test are the most he has bowled in a single day, his 36.2 overs in the match his most since june 2022 and the 66.1 overs in the series his most as captain.stokes pulled up with a back problem during the first test in christchurch, though was able to stay on the field. his immediate reaction here was an instant indication of the severity of the issue.as ravindra hoiked to mid-on, stokes hobbled off, covering his face as he left. ollie pope, already standing-in as wicketkeeper, took over as captain.stokes had treatment and will be assessed further before england make a decision on whether he bats in the second innings.his spell with mi cape town in the sa t20 in january will surely be cancelled and any slim prospect of a return to the england one-day team for the champions trophy is over. more important are the questions over his long-term prospects as a test bowler. when new zealand resumed on 136-3, leading by 340, england's prospects were already bleak and williamson mercilessly removed any semblance of hope.on his home ground, williamson racked up his seventh century and nudged his average at seddon park to 94.94. from 50 overnight, he was watchful and correct, mainly waiting for england to drop short in order to cut to the square boundary.on 73, williamson survived the tightest lbw shout from brydon carse and on 80 miscued shoaib bashir over carse at mid-wicket. on 86, a pull at a stokes bouncer was parried by pope flying down the leg side. it would have been a magnificent catch.when stokes was injured he was replaced in the attack by left-arm spinner jacob bethell, whom williamson hit for six over long-on to go to his 33rd test hundred. the action simply became about how many runs new zealand wanted to amass.williamson seemed nailed for a double, only to sweep bashir to sub fielder rehan ahmed at deep square leg. mitchell holed out to long-off to become bethell's first test wicket.the futility of new zealand continuing to grow their lead bordered on farce. england spared their seamers and harry brook bowled with the second new ball.the crowd chanted for southee and got their wish after mitchell santner was out for 49, including five sixes. england gave southee his second guard of honour of the match, his quest to add to his 98 career sixes ended by lofting bethell to long-on. next ball, bethell bowled henry to end with 3-72.zak crawley overturned being given out leg before to henry from the fifth ball of the innings, before duckett's ridiculous charge at southee.there was still time for henry to get crawley for the sixth time in six innings in the series. crawley ends with a series average of 8.66 â no england opener has ever batted as much in a single series and ended with a lower average.",5269,"he pulled up in the follow-through of his second delivery, went straight to the dressing room and did not return for the remainder of the new

edging the lions 48-42 in detroit.billed as a potential super bowl preview, the top two scorers in the nfl put on a show worthy of the big game, with their two banged-up defences unable to shackle allen or lions quarterback jared goff.goff threw five touchdowns but was always playing from behind after allen's two quick rushing scores early on - as the bills equalled an nfl record with eight straight games scoring 30 points or more.they are also just the second team to score and concede 40 points in back-to-back games.if this fixture is repeated in the super bowl it would be some spectacle, but both sides need to solve some defensive issues if they are to make it to new orleans in february. the 11-3 bills are the only team to beat the 13-1 chiefs and will now fancy pipping them to the afc top seed after the champions saw mahomes limp out late in their 21-7 victory at the cleveland browns.the chiefs have won 10 games this season by one score -

and a team record 10th straight victory of the season.jalen hurts finally got the eagles' passing attack moving a week after receivers aj brown and devonta smith's public criticism, with opposition quarterback russell wilson having all the production problems this week.the steelers did secure a play-off place despite the defeat, but their top spot in the afc north is under threat after the baltimore ravens dominated the new york giants 35-14 to close the gap.lamar jackson threw five touchdown passes before next week's huge showdown against the steelers in baltimore - with pittsburgh also sweating over defensive star tj watt who injured his ankle against the eagles.the houston texans won a second straight afc south title after beating the dolphins 20-12 - in a game overshadowed by a serious injury to miami receiver grant dubose, who was driven off on a stretcher in a neck brace after 10 minutes of treatment following a blow to the head.head coach mike mcdaniel said dubose would remain in hospital overnight after ""some positive feedback"" on his head and neck injuries. jordan love and the green bay packers impressed with a comprehensive 30-13 win in seattle, which saw the seahawks lose top spot in the nfc west and drop out of the play-off places altogether.at 10-4, only five teams in the entire nfl have a better record than the packers, but two of those are in green bay's division - so a wildcard looks their most likely route to the play-offs.the packers helped one of their rivals out, with the minnesota vikings bagging a play-off spot before their monday night game thanks to seattle losing.the divisional system is helping out the tampa bay buccaneers, who improved to just 8-6 with a 40-17 victory over the los angeles chargers and that is good enough to top the weaker nfc south. the washington commanders led 20-7 in the fourth quarter but had to survive a late onslaught at the new orleans saints, with back-up quarterback spencer rattler throwing a touchdown pass as time expired.trailing by a point, interim head coach darren rizzi went for a two-point conversion and instant win instead of settling for overtime, but the try just failed, allowing washington to escape 20-19.indianapolis colts running back jonathan taylor was left red faced when he casually dropped the ball after scoring a touchdown -

of course in the game.england's seamers pounced with the new ball under darkening skies to dismiss south africa for 281 and take a 114-run lead.that advantage was extended to 145 as tammy beaumont and heather knight steered england to 31-1 at the close, after first-innings centurion maia bouchier fell for a duck.south africa earlier appeared on course to reach parity through marizanne kapp, who made a fluent 57 before she was bowled by debutant ryana macdonald-gay which sparked the collapse as the delay came just five balls later.macdonald-gay struck again shortly after the resumption with nadine de klerk caught behind for a duck, lauren filer ended sune luus' resistance for a gritty 56 and chloe tryon tamely chipped lauren bell to mid-on for 20.bell finished with 4-49 after mopping up the tail, with the collapse distracting from the disciplined efforts of south africa's top order throughout the morning and afternoon sessions.opener anneke bosch fell in the second over of the day, but a stand of 92 between laura wolvaardt and annerie dercksen helped the hosts rebuild until the latter was caught at slip off filer from the final ball before lunch.the omission of the decision review system (drs) for the match had a huge impact on the home side as captain wolvaardt was visibly frustrated to be given out lbw to sophie ecclestone for 65, suggesting she had hit the ball.a chanceless partnership of 99 between kapp and luus followed but, once broken, a fragile middle to lower order was exposed and gave england hope of a first test win since 2014. there was some concern that kate cross' omission from england's xi because of a back spasm could leave the seam attack short of control, but bell and filer stepped up with impressive maturity despite south africa's gutsy partnerships for the second and fourth wickets.at times, filer sacrificed accuracy as a result of her raw pace, but that point of difference proved invaluable on a docile pitch.the impressive dercksen withstood the pressure after england's early breakthrough and dug in alongside her captain, and though both batters were tested by filer's short ball in her fiery opening spell, they were mostly untroubled.but knight threw filer the ball for a short burst before lunch and it produced the desired result, with dercksen fending off a short ball to slip where ecclestone took a cracking one-handed rebound catch.while luus and kapp's partnership after lunch was solid, south africa are not blessed with the same batting depth as england and it always felt as if one wicket would change the direction of the test.macdonald-gay took out kapp's off stump with a beauty as reward for her disciplined spell and then the lower order was blown away by bell, with the tail backing away as england moved into the ascendancy. while the seamers played starring roles, wicketkeeper amy jones and left-arm spinner ecclestone also proved crucial. they ensured that south africa's top order, despite batting well, were unable to be ruthless in the manner of bouchier and nat sciver-brunt for england on day one.ecclestone may have got a touch fortunate with the wicket of wolvaardt if she did get an edge, but that moment followed a spell of remarkable consistency that gave the batter so few options to score and put the pressure back on.wolvaardt seemed happy to defend ecclestone and score from the other end, but she could only defy the spinner's greatness for so long, getting stuck on the crease by one defensive prod too many.the result was a furious wolvaardt thumping her helmet with her bat as she marched off in disbelief, and while that was ecclestone's only scalp, she twirled away for 25 overs and conceded just 40, which allowed captain knight to rotate her seamers regularly and ensure they were all well rested between spells.meanwhile, jones' ability to stand up to the medium-pacers set up the prized wicket of kapp, who also found herself stuck in the crease and unable to manipulate the ball as effectively as she had against bell and filer.kapp became frustrated and lost her off stump, while de klerk also fell victim to the same trap as she got an edge through to jones for a sharp catch.luus had previously dropped anchor as kapp was more aggressive, but following the wickets she looked uncertain about whether to continue with the approach or try to increase her strike rate when batting with the tail, eventually falling to the new ball by edging filer behind after a 148-ball stay.the pitch is showing signs of deteriorating and beaumont and knight had to negotiate some uneven bounce at the end of the day.england's healthy lead puts them in a commanding position, though a forecast for wet weather on day four could force them to move the game along at a quicker rate.",5252,"while the seamers played starring roles, wicketkeeper amy jones and left-arm spinner ecclestone also proved crucial.","South africa lose their last seven first-innings wickets for

PGA Tour v LIV - why 'The Showdown' is significant,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c1el0y158g8o,"a supposed peace deadline had just passed and men's professional golf was mired in more uncertainty, when the idea to create a match between pga tour players and those from the breakaway liv circuit was first pitched.the initial approach, by tv producer bryan zuriff, was made to the rory mcilroy camp in dubai last january. zuriff was responsible for previous iterations of 'the match' - televised silly season clashes for cash.but this concept seemed to carry more significance. mcilroy certainly saw it that way as did three of his most notable peers, which is why 'the showdown' comes to fruition in las vegas on tuesday.mcilroy partners world number one scottie scheffler against liv recruits bryson dechambeau and brooks koepka in an 18-hole ryder cup-style matchplay event. for once, this is a confected contest tasty enough to be worth watching. pga versus liv - the establishment against the upstarts and mcilroy against dechambeau - the man who capitalised on the northern irish star's us open capitulation last june.scheffler competes fresh from reminding us of his prowess with victory in the bahamas last week, while dechambeau and 2023 us pga championship winner koepka are past sworn enemies now united as the only players to land majors while playing under the liv umbrella.these are attractive storylines and this is the first time since the open in high summer that this quartet of superstars have all been able to play in the same event.if you wanted to put on a match, these are the four players you would want, which is telling, because professional golf remains a fractured, split sport. but this week's competition is the vehicle to demonstrate that some of the biggest names have had enough of an increasingly tedious and debilitating divide.last week mcilroy was asked whether this event would serve as a detrimental reminder that men's professional golf is still a sport at war. the world number three thought it was ""a terrible question"", but it did yield an interesting response.""we're trying to bring these players together, and the more opportunities we can get to do that, the better,"" mcilroy said.""does it remind people we're not playing together all the time? yes. but at least we're making the effort to try to bring the best together more often. if we can start by doing something like this, that's only a good thing.""he is saying, in other words, that the stars are taking this into their own hands to make an influential push to end the stalemate. this is another example of how the power of leading players has increased while rival factions have been battling for the game's future.scheffler weighed in by saying: ""there's been so much talk about liv versus the pga tour, all this talk about money. we want to get back to the competition. it's fun to get together to compete.""it is fair to say the pga tour was lukewarm about two of its most prominent members' involvement in competing against a pair of liv stars, who remain suspended from the tour for joining the saudi arabia funded league.significantly this match occurs in a week when there is no conflicting pga tour tournament. ""it took a few conversations to get them to the point where they saw that this could be a good thing in the long run,"" mcilroy admitted.""it wasn't all plain sailing, but we got there in the end.""pga tour boss jay monahan and his board continue negotiations with the saudi public investment fund (pif) over a reported acquisition of six percent of the tour's commercial arm by the pif.this is the deal that is now almost a year past its initial deadline, but it could still herald peace in golf's so called 'civil war'.if saudi arabia becomes formally invested in both sides, liv and pga tour players being reunited at tournaments beyond the majors is a more likely scenario.but until a contract is signed and receives us government approval, we have only a handful of dp world tour events where liv recruits have been welcomed and this week's 'showdown' at shadow creek as opportunities to see together golfers from the conflicted constituencies.the players will be mic'd up, but the golf should do the talking because there are enough ingredients to give the contest a degree of edge which has been missing from previous iterations.genuine interaction between the players will be fascinating to hear. we do not need faux banter that can so often infect this kind of occasion and hopefully the players will remember they are golfers rather than comedians.it is no joke to say that this is possibly a glance into the future and not just because the spoils are coming in the form of crypto currency. the liv camp is already talking up an enticing prospect of a ryder cup style match between the rival tours.it is a concept that could excite fans and maybe replace the moribund presidents cup put on in non-ryder years by the pga tour, which is contested by teams representing the us and non-european internationals and is not open to liv golfers.such developments in pro golf do not tend to happen in a hurry, though. nevertheless, the fact that this week's contest is occurring at all is a start.and through its relative competitive validity it is, maybe, a significant step towards some kind of reconciliation.",5235,"a supposed peace deadline had just passed and men's professional golf was mired in more uncertainty, when the idea to create a match between pga tour players and those from the breakaway liv circuit was first pitched.the initial approach, by tv producer bryan zuriff, was made to the rory mcilroy camp in dubai last january. but at least we're making the effort to try to bring the best together more often. if we can start by doing something like this, that's only a good thing. the liv camp is already talking up an enticing prospect of a ryder cup style match between the rival tours.it is a concept that could excite fans and maybe replace the moribund presidents cup put on in non-ryder years by the pga tour, which is contested by teams representing the us and non-european internationals and is not open to liv golfers.such developments in pro golf do not tend to happen in a hurry, though.",Rory mcilroy partners scottie scheffler against liv recruits bryson dechambeau and brooks koepka in an 18-hole ryder cup-style matchplay event.

""we are limited by the supply we are able to offer,"" says mr fink. commercial vineyards in denmark and sweden have only been allowed under european union rules since 2000. winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.curiosity, and the fact ""it's possible"", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains jean becker, from the danish wine association.""i was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. we were six growers,"" says mr becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of copenhagen.there are now 150 commercial wineries in denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.meanwhile, sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the swedish wine association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.""i began with 500 vines,"" said jean becker, ""today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. they start bigger in scale. is there a market for it? the answer is yes.""but it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in france, and almost a million hectares in spain. in southern zealand, jesper rye jensen, who runs vesterhave vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with france.""it is very challenging because it's new for us,"" he says. ""we have to learn it. it's not like southern europe, where they had generation after generation.""data shows that both denmark and sweden have seen average temperatures rise almosttwo degrees celsiusover the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and alonger fruit-growing season.but there remains a risk of frost damage.jesper rye jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. ""we wine growers in denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.""but niels fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. ""climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. that is as threatening here as it is elsewhere."" however, prof torben bo toldam-andersen, a fruit science researcher from the university of copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of scandinavian wineries. ""climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.""he is leading a programme called ""fastgrapes"", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern europe.they are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. new seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.""there are so many things that go into the perfect wine,"" says the researcher. ""part of that search happens in the lab… you can see the genes that make it strong.""the first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across scandinavia, lithuania, northern germany and belgium. but even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.romain chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. born and raised in france, he moved to sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.now 27, the winemaker works at thora vineyard on the country's southwestern bjäre peninsula. ""we need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],"" he says.but ''starting from scratch"" in sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. ""it's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.""thora's owner, american expat heather öberg says all the effort and expense is worth it. ""we can compete with other european wines,"" she says.yet, home-grown scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. danish wine in denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; £22) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest french and spain imports. only a negligible amount is exported.""we will never get in competition with france, italy and spain because they have very low prices,"" says mr becker. at his central copenhagen wine shop, vino fino, owner nicolai christiansen mostly sells french wine. yet he says he has recently sold a case of danish wine to a bar owner in france.""if you can sell it to a french guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,"" he jokes.however, he is still to be convinced about danish wine.

Christmas dinner in the UK set to cost less this yearThe BBC digs into which bits of the festive feast have gone up and down in price.7 hrs agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv3y61qq41o,"falling turkey and brussels sprout prices mean christmas dinner will cost a little less at the supermarket checkout this year.the price of brussels sprouts has fallen by 12%, while a 10lb (4.55kg) frozen turkey will cost you £1.21 less than it did last year, research for the bbc suggests.but digging deeper we discovered root vegetables have gone up in price this year, after wet weather delayed the planting season.when all the trimmings are totted up, a family christmas is set to cost £31.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of £32.18. it reflects food prices rising at a slower rate in the past year, as uk inflation has eased. the annual change in price for products across tesco, sainsbury’s, asda, morrisons, aldi and lidl were measured by retail tracking platform assosia.the crown of the christmas feast, the turkey, has fallen in price by 6% this year, according to this data.tom copas, managing director of copas turkeys in cookham, berkshire, said the price of turkeys had begun to stabilise after a couple of ""incredibly turbulent"" years that had pushed up the cost of rearing his birds.""hence we're seeing incremental changes in prices year on year, rather than dramatic ones,"" added mr copas, whose family has been rearing turkeys since 1957.however, mr copas says he'd seen slower sales and more demand for smaller turkeys this year, perhaps indicating customers were tightening their belts.""it's possibly people are trying to keep the overall basket spend down."" brussels sprouts came in at 12p cheaper for a 500g bag compared to last year.hot summers and sudden cold snaps of the previous two years had made things hard for producers, says john inglis, senior commercial manager at esg drysdale, one of the uk's largest sprout producers.but he says this year has seen us get ""back to normality"" after ""a couple of tricky seasons"" and sprouts are thriving again.the price change may not affect everyone though as the humble sprout can be a divisive veg. a yougov poll earlier this year found that a quarter of britons dislike them, with the controversial brassica more popular with older generations. root vegetables were behind the largest price changes in our christmas shop.maris piper potatoes have seen a whopping 26% increase, with a typical 2kg bag up from £1.58 to £1.99.tracy bush, co-director of provenance potatoes in kent, says poor weather has had a lot to do with the price of spuds going up in recent years.""we've had a particularly wet spring so planting was difficult for any root crops, and then the autumn when crops are lifted and harvested, that was also very difficult,"" she says. carrot farmer rodger hobson says the same wet weather delayed this year's carrot planting season. last year, the weather was so bad that supermarkets had to import carrots. this year,they've gone up by 13.4% to 69p per kilo.but mr hobson says he would not be surprised if ""when it comes to christmas week they'll be down to 20p a kilo"".this is because carrots are often chosen as ""loss leaders"" in supermarkets. they're sold at a loss to attract customers in to spend on more profitable items.ged futter is a retail specialist who used to be a buyer for asda. he says supermarkets drastically reduce their prices in the week before christmas.""every year they do the same thing,"" he says, noting that supermarkets usually fight for customers with cut price ""potatoes, carrots, parsnips, brussels spouts"".mr hobson says perishable items make for good loss leaders because customers can't stockpile them when they are cheap. if supermarkets reduced the price of long-life items like baked beans, shoppers might be tempted to buy their year's supply in december, he says.while loss-leaders are good for shoppers, mr futter stressed these below-cost prices ""don't show the true cost to the farmer"" and can generate a lot of food waste.""people think that food is cheap to produce - that's not true."" this year price rises were not confined to the main meal - the cost of christmas desserts also went up.christmas pudding is 11% more expensive than in 2023, and mince pies are up by 5%, according to assosia's research.jessica white, the owner of meg rivers artisan bakery, says: ""our costs have indeed gone up of ingredients, packaging, wages and like everyone - electricity."" but she says her company had chosen not to put prices up this year.they have already sold out of christmas puddings and have had to make more to fulfil the waiting list, she says. ""we make more and more each year and don't notice a drop in demand."" bbc news also looked into how the cost of a christmas dinner might vary depending on where you shop.we compared prices on the websites of the uk's top five supermarkets - tesco, sainsbury's, asda, morrisons and aldi.our snapshot from one day, which does not take into account loyalty card prices, suggests aldi was the cheapest supermarket for a basic list of christmas essentials, at around £24.30.asda was second cheapest at £28.22, followed by morrisons and sainsbury's.tesco was most expensive at £36.51. last year,our research suggestedmorrisons was the most expensive, with tesco third. while we tried to find equivalent items across all five supermarkets, there are some small differences in product sizes or types. so the cost of your christmas dinner might vary between supermarkets and the items you choose.prices will also vary the closer we get to christmas as supermarket competition becomes even more fierce.our bbc analysis should not be directly compared with the price rise figures from retail analysis firm assosia as we both use a slightly different basket. start with a budget: plan ahead and add up hidden expenses, like tin foil for roasting a turkey.write a food list: decide on your must haves and what you might not miss.bargain hunt: look out for online offers as well as yellow sticker items which have been reduced.use your freezer: christmas foods that freeze well include butter, meat joints and some cheeses like cheddar.join up with friends and family: this means you can buy bigger pack sizes, which are often better value.read more from the bbc food team here",6139,"falling turkey and brussels sprout prices mean christmas dinner will cost a little less at the supermarket checkout this year.the price of brussels sprouts has fallen by 12%, while a 10lb (4.55kg) frozen turkey will cost you £1.21 less than it did last year, research for the bbc suggests.but digging deeper we discovered root vegetables have gone up in price this year, after wet weather delayed the planting season.when all the trimmings are totted up, a family christmas is set to cost £31.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of £32.18.

"Royal Mail takeover by Czech billionaire approvedThe £3.6bn deal by Daniel Kretinsky is cleared after agreeing ""legally binding"" undertakings.7 hrs agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg93390808o,"the sale of royal mail's parent company to a czech billionaire has been cleared by the government.the £3.6bn takeover by daniel kretinsky's ep group has been given the go-ahead after agreeing ""legally binding"" undertakings.the government will retain a so-called ""golden share"" that will require it to approve any major changes to royal mail's ownership, hq location and tax residency.ep group will also have to maintain the one-price-goes-anywhere universal service obligation (uso), which currently means it has to deliver letters six days per week, monday to saturday, and parcels monday to friday. the company has committed to maintaining the uso for as long as it owns royal mail. earlier this year, mr kretinsky told the bbc he would honour the service - in whatever form it takes -""for as long as i am alive"".the uso is currently under review, with royal mail suggesting to regulator ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business ""a fighting chance"".the regulator said in septemberthat it was looking at these changes, with a decision due next year.ofcom chief executive dame melanie dawes told the bbc there were ""real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future"".given letter numbers are falling ""we have to think about what is economical"", adding ofcom would be publishing plans next year ""to make sure it is sustainable"". the takeover of royal mail's parent company, international distribution services (ids), is expected to be completed early next year. when debts are included, the deal values the company at £5.3bn.business secretary jonathan reynolds said while it was up to shareholders to approve the deal, the agreement the government had reached meant the takeover ""will be a good deal for the uk, be a good deal for the people who work for royal mail and a good deal for customers"".mr kretinsky said the talks with the government had ""resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings.he added, that ep group had a ""mission to make royal mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers"". the conditions agreed by ep group include keeping the brand name and royal mail's headquarters and tax residency in the uk for the next five years.it has also reached an agreement in principle with unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to mr kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of royal mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run.dave ward, the general secretary of the cwu union, told the bbc it was an ""extensive agreement"" and the deal was the ""best opportunity"" to save the future of royal mail.however, he added that the union had ""not agreed anything"" on uso reform and there was ""a long way to go"" before that happened. ids also owns a highly profitable european parcels business called gls which made over £300m last year. this offset lossesat royal mail, allowing ids to report a small profit.by bringing gls parcel know-how to the uk market, coupled with investment in out-of-home delivery lockers, mr kretinsky hopes to build a pan-european logistics business.the hope is that this will enable royal mail to claw back market share it has lost in recent years in the profitable and growing parcels business.mr kretinsky has a net worth of £6bn, according to the sunday times rich list.in addition to owning 27% of west ham united football club and 10% of sainsbury's, mr kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of russian gas to europe, paid for and with the consent of the eu.earlier this year the takeover was called in for review under national security laws as royal mail is considered vital national infrastructure.but speaking in front of mps in november, reynolds had referred to mr kretinsky as a ""legitimate business figure""whose alleged links to russiahad already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago. royal mail, which was split from the post office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses.the volume of letters being posted in the uk has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels.last week,royal mail was fined £10.5mby the regulator ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.ofcom's dame melanie dawes told the bbc it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would ""absolutely"" hold royal mail to account.jenny hall, director of corporate affairs at royal mail, told the bbc the company was investing to improve performance, but it was ""really important"" the uso was reformed to reflect consumer trends.she added that royal mail would always try to keep postage costs as low as possible, but prices do ""need to reflect the realities of delivering the service"".the price of a second-class stamp, which is currently 85p, is regulated by ofcom, with the amount royal mail can increase it by each year tied to inflation.however, there are no such limits on first-class stamps, and in october royal

"West African bloc pins hopes on ambitious superhighway from Ivory Coast to NigeriaThe road could breathe new life into West Africa's regional bloc, Ecowas.1 day agoAfrica",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr56dq0gr2mo,"west african leaders are holding a crucial summit in nigeria's capital abuja, focusing on the morale-sapping departure of mali, burkina faso and niger from their 15-member bloc ecowas.few think the military rulers of the three dissident states can be persuaded to pause or reverse their decision.while faced with this blow to regional unity, west africa is also poised to start work on a 1,028km (689 miles) highway from ivory coast's main city abidjan - through ghana, togo and benin - to nigeria's biggest city lagos.construction is supposed to start in 2026 and pledges of $15.6bn (£12.3bn) have already been mobilised from a range of funders and investors.just as western europe matched the soviet-led communist bloc with a ""common market"" that later evolved into today's trading powerhouse, the  european union (eu), so ecowas may find that a drive for prosperity and growth proves to be its most effective response to the wave of military coups and nationalism that have swept across the region since 2020.the plan to build a modern transport corridor along the west african coast was originally approved eight years ago - long before the coups that have overturned civilian rule in mali, burkina faso and niger.preparatory studies, led by the african development bank, were commissioned.but when these were presented last month, the timing could hardly have come at a better moment for reinvigorating the battered self-confidence of ecowas (economic community of west african states).neither traditional diplomacy, nor sanctions, nor even the threat of military intervention in niger, had managed to push the juntas into organising elections and restoring civilian government, as required by ecowas governance rules.the defiant regimes declared they would leave the 15-member bloc altogether.they have subsequently spurned the remaining members' efforts to persuade them to stay, although the ecowas envoy, senegal's new, young president bassirou diomaye faye, who shares their nationalistic outlook, is still trying.until this crisis, ecowas was africa's most cohesive and politically integrated regional grouping, with a creditable record of crisis management and even the deployment of peacekeepers in troubled member states.with the departure of mali, burkina and niger, the bloc will lose 76 million of its 446 million people and more than half its total geographical land area, with the loss of vast tracts of the sahara – a painful blow to prestige and self-belief. the shock of the three countries' withdrawal may boost those pushing for tougher governance and democracy rules.meanwhile, the ambitious coastal transport corridor project, conceived to support economic development, will also serve a political purpose - demonstrating the remaining member countries' capacity to work together and accelerating the trade growth and investment attraction of coastal urban west africa, already the most prosperous part of this vast region.and just as the eu's wealth and dynamism proved a powerful attraction for former communist states, perhaps rising prosperity across ecowas will eventually entice the now disenchanted further north states into rejoining the bloc.construction of the proposed four-to-six lane motorway is forecast to create 70,000 jobs, with completion ambitiously targeted for 2030.and the plan is to acquire a sufficiently broad strip of land along the route to later accommodate a new railway line, linking the big port cities along the gulf of guinea. existing rail routes extend inland, but there is no rail line along the coast.the road will connect many of west africa's largest cities - abidjan, with 8.3 million people, accra (4 million), lomé (2 million), cotonou (2.6 million) and lagos, estimated at close to 20 million or perhaps even more.several of the cities are key gateway ports for the flow of trade in and out of the region.already the bureaucratic hassles and risks of petty corruption that have so often complicated life for drivers passing from one country to the next are beginning to wane.at many border crossings, modern one-stop frontier posts, where officials from both countries work side by side to check passports and transit documents, have replaced the assorted huts where drivers and passengers queued at a succession of counters while one set of border police and customs officers after another laboriously worked their way through the formalities.and now the proposed highway and rail line promise to further speed the flow of trade and travel between the coastal economies, boosting competitiveness and integration and transforming the region's attraction for investors - just as the eu transformed trade and development across the european continent.and that process of economic and administrative integration of course had enormous political consequences.it acted as a powerful incentive for countries still outside the bloc to improve economic governance, strengthen democracy and tackle corruption, in the hope of qualifying for membership.perhaps ecowas can emulate this precedent, and lure the dissident states into re-joining, particularly if flagship projects such as the transport corridor give a real fillip to growth.for not only do mali, niger and burkina face severe development and security challenges, but they are also all landlocked, and heavily dependent on their coastal neighbours, through transport, trade and labour migration. huge volumes of trade, formal and informal, flow across the borders.livestock from the three countries in the sahel is exported on the hoof to feed city dwellers in dakar, abidjan and lagos.onions and potatoes grown in niger's arid climate are prized by coastal household shoppers, while ivorian, ghanaian and nigerian manufactured goods are exported in the opposite direction.millions of burkinabès and malians are settled in ivory coast, a mainstay of the workforce for its cocoa plantations.moreover, the coup leaders are not pulling out of the west african cfa franc, an eight-country single currency, backed by france, that hampers competitiveness but provides a solid defence against inflation and monetary instability.yet these deep ties between the sahelian countries and coastal west africa were not sufficient to deter the military regimes in mali, burkina and niger from announcing their withdrawal from ecowas.hostility to the bloc, which they portray as bullying and arrogant, has paid political dividends, boosting their popularity at home. and morocco talks of opening up an alternative trade corridor to its atlantic ports, which could broaden the options.but if the remaining ecowas countries can accelerate their own drive for prosperity, pruning back trade barriers and pressing forward with breakthrough projects such as the coastal highway and rail line, then gradually they may salve today's political bruises and mistrusts and draw the sahel states back into a reunified west african regional identity.paul melly is a consulting fellow with the africa programme at chatham house in london. how a uranium mine became a pawn in the row between niger and francewhy west africa's united front is in tattersbola tinubu's u-turn on niger sanctions received with relief go tobbcafrica.comfor more news from the african continent.follow us on twitter@bbcafrica, on facebook atbbc africaor on instagram atbbcafrica",7344,"and morocco talks of opening up an alternative trade corridor to its atlantic ports, which could broaden the options.but if the remaining ecowas countries can accelerate their own drive for prosperity, pruning back trade barriers and pressing forward with breakthrough projects such as the coastal highway and rail line, then gradually they may salve today's political bruises and mistrusts and draw the sahel states back into a reunified west african regional identity.paul melly is a consulting fellow with the africa programme at chatham house in london. how a uranium mine became a pawn in the row between niger and francewhy west africa's united front is in tattersbola tinubu's u-turn on niger sanctions received with relief go tobbcafrica.comfor more news from the african continent.follow us on twitter@bbcafrica, on facebook atbbc africaor on instagram atbbcafrica","Mali, burkina faso and niger will leave the 15-member bloc ecowas.

UK 'doesn't have enough builders' for Labour's 1.5m homesBuilders and developers say reforms are needed to recruit more tradespeople to build the homes being promised.3 days agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg1471rwpo,"the uk does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the bbc.the home builders federation (hbf), along with the uk's largest housebuilder barratt redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.the government confirmed there was a ""dire shortage"" of construction workers but said it was ""taking steps to rectify"" the problem. last week, prime minister sir keir starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in england by 2029.and on thursday he unveiled sweepingchanges to the planning system and vowed to override ""blockers"" standing in the way of building the new homes.labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.the current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the construction industry training board (citb).but for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the hbf, the trade body for the house building industry in england and wales.based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineersthe hbf said while the industry had ""the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out"".when asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, david thomas, chief executive of barratt redrow, said: ""the short answer is no.""he told the bbc the government would have to ""revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production"" for their target to be met.""they're challenging targets, i think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,"" mr thomas said.but the hbf also said the uk ""does not have a sufficient talent pipeline"" of builders to employ. it cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.the industry body admitted the sector itself had not ""attracted"" enough new recruits in recent years.all of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said. barratt redrow boss mr thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.""if you went back to the 60s and 70s, i think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,"" he said.the average rates of pay for these jobs ""are high"" but the issue was ""more about availability of labour with skills, he said.an experienced bricklayer can earn around £45,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about £38,000 and electricians £44,000, according to government figures. skills shortages have been an issue in the uk for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the european union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of brexit.the hbf said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and ""restrictions"" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.mr thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern eu countries, admitting that ""in hindsight"", the uk had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the ""norm"".according to the industry's latest census, romania, india and poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. more than half of london's construction workforce are eu/eea nationals.last month, the government announced £140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established ""homebuilding skills hubs"" to fast-track training.a government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to ""make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously"".but ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said theywere ""unrealistic"" and ""impossible to achieve"".the independent think tank centre for cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.but both barratt redrow and the hbf have welcomed the government plans. the hbf said ""a more pro-development policy approach"" would enable the industry to ""invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply"".despite recruitment challenges, barratt redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what barratt itself forecast,before the merger with redrowin october.",5409,"""he told the bbc the government would have to ""revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production"" for their target to be met. it cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.the industry body admitted the sector itself had not ""attracted"" enough new recruits in recent years.all of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.","The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.

"Milei, Musk and Maga: Is Argentina influencing the US?As Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.3 days agoLatin America",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y86vv0wneo,"as argentina's maverick libertarian president javier milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the us.milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.despite his tough austerity measures anda continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according toa survey carried out earlier this monthby the cb consultora organisation.that level of popularity is similar to that of donald trump right now. roughly half of us voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and trump has hailed milei as a man who can ""make argentina great again"". meanwhile, tech billionaire elon musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming us administration, has also praised milei, saying argentina is ""experiencing a giant improvement"" under his leadership.but what is it that trump and musk see in milei? and are they as close ideologically as is often assumed? milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. but he has caused a stir in the us because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in washington along the lines of what is happening in buenos aires.in milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline aerolineas argentinas, which has already been privatised once before beingrenationalised in 2008.all this is music to the ears of elon musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-calleddepartment of government efficiency- a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire vivek ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (£1.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. according to him, milei is doing ""a fantastic job"" in argentina by ""deleting entire departments"" - and he would like to follow suit in the us, with trump's blessing. but long-time latin america observers are sceptical.monica de bolle, senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington, says that ""taking inspiration from milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense"".""the situation in argentina is very particular to argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. that has nothing to do with the us.""ms de bolle says argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was ""bursting into crisis every few years"".""that is appropriate for argentina, but for nobody else."" marcelo j garcía, buenos aires-based director for the americas at global consulting firm horizon engage, says milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a ""masterpiece"" of political marketing that has ""captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe"".but he argues that while musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what trump wants.""i'm not sure that the trump platform is compatible with a milei-type chainsaw small government,"" he told the bbc.he points out that trump's policies ""require big government in some areas"", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. ""you can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.""in milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government. milei and trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the ""woke agenda"". but in economic terms, their ideas are very different.milei is a passionate free-trader, and argentina is a member of the south american trading bloc mercosur, which also includes brazil, paraguay, and uruguay.while he is in favour of mercosur's recentfree-trade deal with the european union,he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. as a result, he says mercosur ""has ended up becoming a prison"".""if the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?"" he said at the mercosur summit in uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the eu was signed.trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the us-mexico-canada agreement (usmca), but for reasons that are the opposite of milei's.trump wants to renegotiate the usmca, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting us manufacturing and safeguarding us jobs.he has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose ablanket 25% tariffon goods from both canada and mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the us. monica de bolle doubts that trump shares musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: ""you can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. so trump doesn't care. he put elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.""the economic debate is set to run and run, in both the us and argentina. but ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 january, but milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.as marcelo j garcía sees it, milei is a ""divisive leader"" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.""the other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,"" he says.""leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. that's not the case with milei,"" he adds.in his view, this is a real weakness: ""you don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.""milei's next big test of public opinion will come in october 2025, when argentina holds midterm elections. that could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam.",6842,"roughly half of us voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and trump has hailed milei as a man who can ""make argentina great again"".

4 days agoWhy 'digital twins' could speed up drug discoveryAI can create digital humans and digital organs that can be used in clinical trials.4 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8v73dkne3o,"this is the first of a six-part series on how ai is changing medical research and treatments.the heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.it's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.but the heart's creators, adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.these ai-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.as these differences often aren’t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without ai.“this allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. this use of ai to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,” says adsilico chief executive sheena macpherson. in 2018 an investigation by theinternational consortium of investigative journalistsrevealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.ms macpherson hopes that ai powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.“to really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,"" says ms macpherson, who is based in northumberland.""so you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.“even a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. you can also get more detailed results.""you could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.”ms macpherson adds: “[virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. it also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.” adsilico’s ai models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real mri and ct scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.the data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.adsilico’s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an ai-generated simulation.it all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all ai-simulated versions of a real human heart. human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants. more on ai and medicine perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with ai digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.drug manufacturer sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. it is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.using biological data from real people, sanofi creates ai-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.sanofi’s ai programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the ai patients. the programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process. “with a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,” says matt truppo, sanofi’s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.the results so far have been promising, mr truppo, who is based in boston, us, adds.“there is still a lot to do. many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. this is where tools like ai come in. powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate ai models of complex human biology is the next frontier.” digital twins might have weaknesses though, says charlie paterson, an associate partner at pa consulting and a former nhs service manager.he points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.""[due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.”working with limited legacy data to train its ai is an issue sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.to fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks. back at adsilico, ms macpherson is hopeful that one day ai digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.“a virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,” she says.",6163,"“this allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. ”ms macpherson adds: “[virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. more on ai and medicine perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with ai digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.drug manufacturer sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. back at adsilico, ms macpherson is hopeful that one day ai digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process. “a virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,” she says.","Ai-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds. digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations.","Ai digital twin technology is being used to supplement clinical trials with ai digital twins.

"Israeli strikes kill 50 in Gaza, Hamas-run health ministry saysThe Israeli military says Sunday's strikes targeted sites used by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.6 hrs agoMiddle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rnvy1zn10o,"more than 50 people were killed in israeli air and ground attacks across the gaza strip on sunday, according to local medics and rescuers.they said children, a cameraman who worked for the al jazeera tv network and personnel from the civil defence agency were among the dead.the israeli military said it targeted sites used by hamas and the allied armed group palestinian islamic jihad.the hamas-run health ministry said the deaths meant the number of palestinians killed in gaza during the 14-month war between israel and hamas had surpassed 45,000. the ministry does not make a distinction between combatants and civilians, but it reported in october that 29,980 children, women and elderly were among the identified fatalities.the figures are often disputed by the israeli government, which says almost 20,000 ""terrorists"" have been killed, but they are broadly accepted by un agencies.the war began when hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern israel on 7 october 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. many of those killed on sunday were in a un-run school being used as a shelter for displaced families in the southern city of khan younis.harrowing footage showed a bloody scene on the third floor of ahmed bin abdul aziz school, with children's bodies apparently among those being removed.""people were safe, staying in their homes after they prayed the dinner prayer. they were sitting, sleeping, and staying put in their places,"" manal tafesh, whose brother and his children were among those killed, told reuters news agency outside a local mortuary.medics said at least 13 people were killed, while a spokeswoman for the un agency for palestinian refugees (unrwa) said she had heard reports of around 20 casualties, many of them women and children.""it's just doesn't stop. it's so relentless the pain and the suffering that we continue to have,"" louise wateridge told the bbc from central gaza.the israel defense forces (idf) said it had ""conducted a precise strike on hamas terrorists who were operating inside a command-and-control centre"" embedded within the school.it also accused hamas and other armed groups of exploiting civilians and using civilian infrastructure as human shields.medics said several more people were killed at another school-turned-shelter in the northern town of beit hanoun, which the un said has been under siege by israeli forces for more than two months.the un said it was monitoring reports that more than 1,500 people were newly displaced after israeli forces besieged khalil aweida school and shelled it.the idf said on sunday that its forces ""conducted a targeted raid on a terrorist meeting point in the beit hanoun area"".""in co-operation with the [israeli air force], the troops struck dozens of terrorists from both the air and ground, and additional terrorists were apprehended,"" it added. another strike hit a civil defence building in the urban nuseirat refugee camp in central gaza.civil defence spokesman mahmoud basal said the strike killed the directors of its nuseirat and sheikh radwan centres along with two volunteers, one of whom he named as ahmad baker al-louh. another five people were injured, three of them critically, he added.""the israeli occupation has once again shown the world that there is no protection for humanitarian workers in gaza and no adherence to international humanitarian laws,"" he said, adding that 94 civil defence workers had been killed since the start of the war.ahmad al-louh was a cameraman for the qatar-based al jazeera network, which strongly condemned what it called israel's ""targeted killing"" of its journalist.it said louh had been covering a rescue operation by the civil defence following an earlier strike on sunday and that it came ""just days after the targeting of his house"".""the network calls on all human rights and media organisations to condemn the israeli occupation's systematic killing of journalists in cold blood, the evasion of responsibilities under international humanitarian law, and to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice,"" a statement said.the idf said the civil defence building was used by ""terrorists to plan and carry out an imminent terror attack against idf troops"".""among the terrorists eliminated in the strike was the islamic jihad terrorist ahmad bakr al-louh, who previously served as a platoon commander in the islamic jihad's central camps brigade,"" it alleged, without providing any evidence.al jazeera did not comment on the israeli allegation, butlouh's cousin mahmoud told the associated press: ""we were stunned by the israeli occupation statement.""""these claims are lies and misleading to cover up this crime,"" he added.the committee to protect journalists says at least 137 journalists and media workers have been killed in gaza, the occupied west bank, israel

was speaking to irish broadcaster rté after her country's decision to close its embassy in ireland.erlich said the ""tough decision"" was not taken lightly.taoiseach (irish prime minister) simon harris said that he did not regret the irish government's intervention in the international court of justice (icj) case in relation to israel. ireland had previously indicated its support for south africa's legal action against israel in the icj, saying it would ask the court ""to broaden its interpretation of what constitutes the commission of genocide by a state"".harris has also rejected that ireland is anti-israel.however, speaking on rté news at one, erlich said of ireland's request to the icj: ""this is an abuse of the international multilateral system by south africa, we were sorry to see ireland join it, but this joins an accumulation of steps, rhetoric and initiatives that we've seen ireland trying to promote this past year.""unfortunately in the past year we've seen ireland position itself in an extreme position that no other country has put itself.""in most countries we have difficult conversations and we have disagreements – we accept criticism, but this has gone over that line in ireland.""we see ireland in a more extreme stance than any other country.""erlich said she heard concerns from the jewish and israeli communities in ireland.""we direct those concerns to the irish government, the government that needs to make sure that they are safe, that there is a future for the jewish community in ireland,"" she said.""these assurances need to be made."" the taoiseach said his ""priority is to shine a spotlight on what is happening in the middle east and we should not allow anything to distract from what is happening"".he said although he regretted the actions of the israeli government regarding the embassy closure, he emphasised the importance of diplomatic relations and that ireland would continue to engage with israel.""i'm very proud of the decision ireland has taken, we are pro human rights and international law,"" he added.sinn féin president mary lou mcdonald said the irish government must ""hold firm"" on its stance with regard to israel and gaza.mcdonald described the move by israel over its embassy in dublin as an attempt to test the will of the irish government.""we need to work with others to bring as much pressure as possible on the [benjamin] netanyahu regime,"" she said. ireland's jewish representative council chairperson said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the deterioration in the relationship between the ireland and israel.chairperson maurice cohen said that the closure of israel's embassy has caused distress for israeli people in ireland.he said the irish government's intervention in the icj risks ""oversimplifying a highly complex and tragic conflict, unfairly isolating israel, and undermining the integrity of the term 'genocide'.""mr cohen said that for the jewish community in ireland, ""the closure of the embassy represents not only a symbolic blow but also a practical disadvantage"".""consular services provided by the embassy are vital for those maintaining connections with family, culture, and heritage in israel,"" he added.""losing this resource will leave many feeling unsupported and aggrieved.""closing the embassy risks alienating a significant segment of irish society and sends a message that dialogue is being replaced by disengagement.""he said that the jewish representative council of ireland reaffirmed its commitment to peace and the protection of innocent lives ""on all sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict"", while also supporting israel's right to defend itself from ""terrorism and existential threats"".mr cohen called on both the irish and israeli governments to seek pathways to rebuild trust and to ensure avenues for diplomatic engagement remain open. daniel epstein-o'dowd, from the ireland israel alliance, told bbc news ni that it was a ""predictable"" decision by israel to close its embassy in dublin and that ""post october 7th there has just been provocation after provocation by the irish government"".he said it is a ""very symbolic move by israel and showing that they ultimately don't see any value in retaining any diplomatic presence"" in the republic of ireland.""there are many israelis who are in the tech industry here in dublin who are a little bit stranded and isolated quite frankly, they feel the israeli embassy was very much there for them, particularly in the dark days immediately post october 7th, the embassy really shone through in the sense of that community,"" he added.""so i think it is wondering where do they go next?""i don't think that detail has yet been released, but i think it is ultimately going to be somewhere else other than ireland, it's a very sad day for anybody in ireland or israel."" tánaiste (irish deputy prime minister) micheál martin said there are no plans to close its embassy in israel.on 7 october last year, hamas launched an attack in southern israel killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.in retaliation, israel launched a massive operation inside the

passed to end the 2006 lebanon war: hezbollah would pull back from the border to be replaced by un peacekeepers and the lebanese armed forces. as they moved in, israeli forces would gradually move out.but prime minister netanyahu went to the podium at the un to deliver a fiery speech that refused to accept any pause in israel’s offensive.back at his new york hotel netanyahu’s official photographer captured the moment as he ordered the assassination of hassan nasrallah, the leader of hezbollah, along with most of his high command. netanyahu’s office released the photos, in another calculated snub for american diplomacy.the assassination was a significant escalation and a blow to hezbollah. in the weeks since, israel’s military has inflicted immense damage to hezbollah’s military organisation. it could still fire rockets over the border and its fighters continued to engage israel’s invasion force. buthezbollah is no longer the same threatto israel. military success is one of several factors that have come together to persuade benjamin netanyahu that this is a good time to stop.israel’s agenda in lebanon is more limited than in gaza and the rest of the occupied palestinian territories. it wants to push hezbollah back from its northern border and to allow civilians to return to border towns.if hezbollah looks to be preparing an attack, israel has a side letter from the americans agreeing that it can take military action.in a recorded statement announcing his decision, netanyahu listed the reasons why it was time for a ceasefire. israel, he said, had made the ground in beirut shake. now there was a chance ‘to give our forces a breather and replenish stocks,’ he continued.israel had also broken the connection between gaza and lebanon. after the late hassan nasrallah ordered the attacks on israel’s north, the day after hamas went to war on 7 october last year, he said they would continue until there was a ceasefire in gaza. now, netanyahu said, hamas in gaza would be under even more pressure. palestinians fear another escalation in israel’s gaza offensive.there was one more reason; to concentrate on what netanyahu called the iranian threat. damaging hezbollah means damaging iran. it was built up by the iranians to create a threat right on israel’s border. hezbollah became the strongest part of iran’s axis of resistance, the name it gave to its network of forward defence made up of allies and proxies. just like hezbollah’s surviving leaders, their patrons in iran also wanted a ceasefire. hezbollah needs a pause to lick its wounds. iran needs to stop the geostrategic bleeding. its axis of resistance is no longer a deterrent. iran’s missile attack on israel after nasrallah’s assassination did not repair the damage.two men, both now assassinated, designed hezbollah to deter israel not just from attacking lebanon – but also from attacking iran. they were qasem soleimani, head of the quds force of iran’s revolutionary guards, who was killed by an american drone strike at baghdad airport in january 2020. the order was issued by donald trump in his last few weeks in the white house at the end of his first term. the other was hassan nasrallah, killed by a huge israeli air strike in beirut’s southern suburbs.hezbollah and iran’s deterrence strategy matchedisrael’s own deterrencefor almost 20 years after the end of the 2006 war. but among the profound changes caused by the 7 october attacks was israel’s determination not to accept restrictions on the wars it would wage in response. america, its most important ally, also put almost no restrictions on the supply or use of the weapons it kept on providing.nasrallah and iran failed to see what had happened. they did not understand how israel had changed.  they sought to impose a war of attrition on israel, and succeeded for almost a year. then on 17 september israel broke out of it by triggering the miniature bombs built into the network of booby-trapped pagers its intelligence services had duped hezbollah into buying.hezbollah was thrown off balance. before it could react with the most powerful weapons iran had provided, israel killed nasrallah and most of his key lieutenants, accompanied by massive strikes that destroyed arms dumps. that was followed by an invasion of south lebanon and the wholesale destruction of lebanese border villages as well as hezbollah’s tunnel network. a ceasefire in lebanon is not necessarily a precursor to one in gaza. gaza is different. the war there is about more than security of the border, and israeli hostages.it is also about revenge, about benjamin netanyahu’s political survival, and his government’s absolute rejection of palestinian aspirations for independence.the lebanon ceasefire is fragile and deliberately paced to buy time for it to work. when the 60 days in which it is supposed to take effect ends, donald trump will be back in the oval office. president-elect trump has indicated that he wants a ceasefire in lebanon, but his precise plans have not yet emerged. the middle east is waiting for the ways he might affect the region. some optimists hope that he might want to create a moment akin to president nixon’s sensational visit to china in 1972 by reaching out to iran.the pessimists fear he might abandon even the hollow genuflection that the us still makes to the idea of a creating an independent palestine alongside israel – the so-called two state solution. that might pave the way to annexation of those parts of the occupied palestinian territories israel wants, including much of the west bank and northern gaza.what is certain though is that themiddle east has no chance of escapingmore generations of war and violent death until the region’s fundamental political ruptures are faced and fixed. the biggest is the conflict between israel and the palestinians.benjamin netanyahu and his government, along with most israelis believe it is possible to dominate their enemies by pressing on to a military victory. netanyahu is actively using force, unrestrained by the us, to alter the balance of power in the middle east in israel’s favour.in a conflict that has lasted more than a century both arabs and jews have dreamt repeatedly of peace through military victory. every generation has tried and failed. the catastrophic consequences of the hamas attacks on israel on 7 october 2023 ripped away any pretence that the conflict could be managed while israel continued to deny palestinian rights to self-determination. the ceasefire in lebanon

"Remembering the man who became Indian music's global ambassadorZakir Hussain, legendary tabla virtuoso, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy.11 hrs agoAsia",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwype77kwyjo,"zakir hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of indian classical musicwho has died aged 73, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy that will inspire generations.a child prodigy, he collaborated with indian classical icons like ravi shankar, ali akbar khan, and shivkumar sharma and global musicians like john mclaughlin and george harrison.born on 9 march, 1951, in mahim, mumbai, he was the eldest son of ustad allarakha, one of history's most iconic players of the tabla - a pair of traditional indian hand played drums.hussain's journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation.hussain's life revolved around rhythm from the very beginning.the sound of the tabla was his first language, his earliest ""words"". by the age of 12, he was already performing globally, accompanying stalwarts like pandit ravi shankar and ustad ali akbar khan during his teenage years.while rooted in the hindustani classical tradition, hussain possessed an insatiable curiosity that propelled him to explore other genres, leading to ground-breaking collaborations across the world.in 1973, he co-founded shakti with guitarist john mclaughlin, a group that fused indian classical music with jazz and western traditions, creating a new global sound.over five decades, shakti evolved, featuring luminaries like violinist l shankar, percussionist vikku vinayakram, and mandolin maestro u srinivas.their first studio album in 46 years, this moment, won the grammy for best global music album in 2024, marking a fitting finale to their 50th-anniversary tour. hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to shakti's success and to the global appreciation of indian rhythms. zakir hussain's contributions extended far beyond shakti.he was a key collaborator in planet drum and global drum project, both with grateful dead drummer mickey hart, earning him grammy awards in 1991 and 2008.he worked with banjo maestro béla fleck and bassist edgar meyer on the grammy-winning as we speak (2024), further cementing his status as a pioneer of cross-genre collaborations. he also collaborated with musicians as diverse as yo-yo ma, george harrison, van morrison and billy cobham, bringing indian classical music to global audiences.his ventures like tabla beat science, a fusion of indian classical music with electronic and world music, and orchestral works such aspeshkarfor the symphony orchestra of india showcased his unrelenting drive to innovate while respecting his roots.""the moment you think you're a maestro, you are distancing yourself from the others,"" hussain toldrolling stone indiamagazine earlier this year. ""you have to be part of a group, and not dominate it.""this philosophy made him not only a consummate artist but also a lifelong learner and mentor.hussain's flamboyance and speed and precision of his performances earned him widespread admiration.the new york times, in its review of a 2009 jazz performance at carnegie hall, described his artistry as embodying""an impish strain of virtuosity"".""he's a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. so he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings."" his accolades are as numerous as the beats he crafted.a recipient of the padma bhushan and padma shri, hussain was also a national endowment for the arts national heritage fellow in the united states. he delighted audiences at prestigious venues like carnegie hall and collaborated with jazz legends, western classical orchestras, and carnatic music maestros.despite his global acclaim, hussain remained deeply connected to his indian roots. his early years in a modest chawl - large tenement complexes - in mahim shaped his values.""for the first three-and-a-half years of my life, we all lived in one room that had no toilet. we had to use the common toilets,"" hussain told nasreen munni kabir.offstage, hussain was an avid reader and a fan of isaac asimov's foundation series. he loved poetry, cricket, and tennis, counting roger federer among his heroes. his curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like ravi shankar and miles davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. hussain would also later say that his tv advert for a popular tea brand - taj mahal - ""made me famous in india"".hussain's death marks the end of an era but leaves an indelible mark on global music. kabir, who chronicled his life, aptly captured his essence: ""zakir's extraordinary playing and the extreme sense of rigour he brought to his art made him a phenomenon.""music for hussain was not just a career but a spiritual journey - a way to connect with people, traditions, and cultures across the globe.in his final years, hussain remained as active as ever, performing, mentoring, and composing.""being a student and having a drive to learn keeps me going. the opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself. age doesn't affect my energy and drive,"" he said last year.",5110,"hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to shakti's success and to the global appreciation of indian rhythms. you have to be part of a group, and not dominate it. we had to use the common toilets,"" hussain told nasreen munni kabir.offstage, hussain was an avid reader and a fan of isaac asimov's foundation series. his curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like ravi shankar and miles davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. the opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself.","zakir hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of indian classical music, has died aged 73.

The Christmas number one race - and how to win itAll Mariah and Wham! want for Christmas is a chart-topper. Can a newcomer like Tom Grennan stop them?2 days agoCulture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg6ejq7zpyo,"this year's christmas number one single will be unwrapped on friday, with a mixture of old favourites, new efforts and wild cards all in the running.last year, wham! classic last christmastopped the yuletide singles chart,remarkably for the first time since its release in 1984, when the original band aid kept it off the number one spot.as is tradition, the festive number one will be announced on bbc radio 1's chart show from 16:00 gmt on the friday before christmas.at the time of writing, a stocking full of artists - naughty and nice - are hoping to top the list. wham!'s hit is the frontrunner after reclaiming the top spot in the last chart before the christmas one, as people streamed it to get into the festive spirit. it has also been reissued on cd and 12-inch vinyl for its 40th anniversary for the final week of the chart race, giving it a further boost.another seasonal staple,mariah carey'sall i want for christmas, is not far behind.also in this year's mix arebrenda lee's golden oldie rockin' around the christmas tree and the latest incarnation ofband aid.they're joined by a new festive tune bytom grennan, while songs byariana grandeandkelly clarksonhave established themselves as returning christmas classics.or the chart crown could go to something non-christmassy - like recent hits bygracie abrams,roseandbruno mars, or the fast-risinglola young.there was a long period when the christmas number one was reserved for the latest x factor winner - seven times between 2005-14 - or novelty charity-fundraising sausage-roll enthusiast ladbaby, a five-time victor between 2018-22.and just like with buying gifts, the key for any artists involved now, according to official chart company boss martin talbot, is to step into christmas with confidence and a strategy, and to go early. ""the singles market is very much dominated by streaming these days, in general terms, throughout the year,"" he says.""but the christmas market is the one market where you can sell a lot of physical [copies and] a lot of downloads and actually make a big difference. because people want to buy gifts.""that's where wham! will do really well this year.""physical or download sales count for much more than streams in the chart in the digital era. ""the other thing is, if you've got a charity record, let's not be shy about it,"" talbot notes.that's an adage not lost on bob geldof and the band aid team, who are going again with their own 40th anniversary ultimate mix, which has made headlines this timeafter ed sheeran saidhe would have preferred for his vocals not to have been used again because of the song's portrayal of africa.""when people engage with charity records, they're not doing it because they specifically want to listen to the charity record over and over again, talbot notes.""streaming doesn't really work."" instead, he says: ""it's all about voting. and you cast your vote by buying a download or by buying physical products.""east 17,reverend and the makersandthe celebsare all also having a go in aid of various charities this year, as aresouth yorkshire fire & rescue. mariah's slow-burning 1994 anthem finally topped the uk chart for the first time in 2020,returning to the summit in 2022.yet despite it being screeched by revellers across the country every december, the unofficial queen of christmas (her bid to trademark that moniker was denied by us authorities)has never been at the top of the uk chart in christmas week itself.""it was the first christmas song i ever wrote and i was just thinking about all the things that i really did want at christmas,"" sherecently told rylan in a bbc interview.""i guess i turned it into, if there's something that you love, it means more than all that stuff."" aww.her tune, like wham!'s and band aid's, has benefitted from being heavily promoted by streaming services like spotify, apple and amazon on their top christmas playlists. in recent years, amazon has thrown its might behind new christmas songs that are exclusive to its service. they have included sam ryder's you're christmas to me, which narrowly lost out to wham! last year, and ellie goulding's river, which topped the chart just after christmas in 2019.this year, grennan's soulful, lovelorn it can't be christmas is only available via amazon music.grennan, who actually penned the track in los angeles in the summer, said it was a ""no-brainer"" for him to team up with the streamer to create his own festive song.amazon has also commissioned icelandic-chinese singer-songwriterlaufey's christmas magic.she said being asked to come up with an original to go up against the usual suspects was ""such a fun challenge"".the classically-trained star's jazzy number features in red one, a holiday-themed action movie starring dwayne johnson, chris evans and lucy liu - and made by amazon. chart expert james masterson says the christmas number one race began as an invention of british bookmakers in 1984.while it used to produce many bona fide pop hits, he believes the concept has been ""ruined"" in recent years, not least by the admittedly well-intentioned ladbaby.""it became pointless speculating as to what was going to be christmas number one,"" he says of the ladbaby era.""which is why, when he didn't release a song last year, it left this void and it was a void that nobody came along to fill.""last christmas ""won by default"", he says, because it appears at the top of all the christmas playlists playing ""the same old songs, every single year, in much the same order"". due to a crowded christmas market, masterson says many record labels began to feel it's not worth worrying about the end of year chart any more.chart rules dictate that songs released in the last three years are weighted more favourably than those already in the christmas canon.but even with that factor in their favour, he feels it is increasingly difficult for artists with genuinely good new seasonal songs to ""achieve enough momentum"" to ""get lucky"".""my view is that if last christmas by wham! gets the christmas number one again by default, it would be a disaster for the whole concept,"" he concludes.so anyone launching a late bid - be it fans of the lateliam payne, liberal democrat leadered daveyoryorkshire pudding boy-will probably require a cracking campaign.there have been upsets in the past - fans ofrage against the machine's killing in the nameput a small-but-welcome dint in the x factor monopoly in 2009. talbot thinks that ifsheeran really ""wanted to really go for it"" with under the tree, his song from richard curtis's that christmas movie, he could challenge wham! and  mariah.alternatively, the ""wicked phenomenon could be really powerful"", meaningcynthia ervivoand grande's defying gravity could pull off a ""surprise"" as families and friends head for outings to the cinema.us pop sensationsabrina carpenterhas released a christmas-centric ep, fruitcake, which could top the festive album chart, but its tracks don't seem to be in the running for the singles crown.so it's beginning to look a lot like wham!

Robbie Williams on why he's played by a chimp in new film17 hrs agoCulture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7r21egd82o,"robbie williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo.""i was at this thing called the governors' ball the other night. that was amazing,"" the singer says.he is talking about the governors' awards, held in los angeles, where he joined other guests including tom hanks, angelina jolie and daniel craig.""i'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. i feel like an artist that's just been signed. i'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.""the project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in hollywood is his biopic better man.""kevin costner sought me out,"" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: ""he wanted to come and tell me about the movie."" better man deals with williams' life from childhood, through the take that years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at knebworth (with the aim of annoying oasis, who had only managed two).the twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.at least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. if sir david attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing angels and rock dj is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.to paraphrase the debut album of williams' old boyband, ape that and party. williams is speaking to me at london's soho hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, rupert everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by jennifer lawrence.williams is sitting next to michael gracey, the director of 2017 hit the greatest showman.now, after a gap of seven years, better man is gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey. for a year and half, williams and gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.""there have been a lot of musical biopics,"" says gracey. ""i wanted to come at this with a different lens.""quite often rob will say, 'i'm just like a performing monkey' or 'i'm up the back like a performing monkey'.""it just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see rob, but how he sees himself.""and so i pitched the idea to rob. i said, 'you know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'""williams takes up the story: ""i was looking for some self-worth at the time and i was like, 'i am a lion'. and he just cocked his head and went, 'mmmm.'""i went, 'monkey?'""and he went, 'yeah, so here's the idea.' and before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, i'm like, 'yes, that, that, that, please'."" the monkey was created by weta, the special effects company responsible for gollum in lord of the rings and caesar in planet of the apes. they used a combination of motion capture and cgi, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by english actor jonno davies, best known as tobias in the al pacino tv series hunters.but it turns out that the original plan was for williams himself to play the monkey.""i was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,"" he says. ""and the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.""there are loads of things that i want to do that are just best being an idea. it was great at dinner parties, 'i'm playing me in a story about me.'""and by the time it came round to it, i was bored of the idea. 'i've said it at dinner parties now. i've done it.'"" williams did perform the whole of my way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the royal albert hall in 2022.""we also scanned his eyes,"" explains gracey, ""so when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one rob's eyes.""""i kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,"" interrupts williams.""i want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film.""also, jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and i want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic."" robbie williams sums up better man as ""the greatest hits of my trauma for the tiktok generation"".and the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when nicole appleton from all saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion.""my part in her life i still have shame about. it's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,"" williams admits.""she did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. i was an idiot younger boyfriend."" appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike williams' father peter conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years.in better man, he is played by inside no 9's steve pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family.""he hasn't seen it yet. and i don't know if i want him to,"" says williams.""i haven't spoken to him about it. i'm embarrassed. i love my dad. best mate, charming, wonderful man.""but as it is with everybody's childhood, like the philip larkin poem, 'they mess you up your mum and dad.' and i'm messing my kids up."" the film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of williams' time in take that.""there's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. and i don't think anybody gets to escape that,"" is his summary.""i don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. i just know that it does. i know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. it should come with a health warning.""the death earlier this year of one direction's liam payne, who he mentored on the x factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.""it's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and i want to head that. i want to do that,"" he says.""it has to be creative people, not members of parliament or record company bosses. i think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.""but these plans will have to wait. at the moment, williams' full attention is on the film and the oscars.success in the us is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke america. (angels reached 53 in the billboard chart, millennium 72 and that was it.)in 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating i will talk and hollywood will listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric ""mr spielberg look just what you're missing"".how things change. better man has already earned a golden globe nomination for best song. and on tuesday, he will find out whether forbidden road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the academy awards.and there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination.""best visual effects,"" starts gracey, before williams interjects once more.""best musical monkey!"" he beams.gracey laughs.

""cinema is so subjective,"" he says.but he admits a win would mean a lot to india. ""i think indians are so film crazy and we've been dying to win the academy award for an indian film, which hasn't happened till now. so the country will go ballistic. they'll just go mad if we win,"" he says.""so just for the people of our country and for our country, i would be really happy if we win the award.""set in rural india, laapataa ladies tells the story of a young man bringing the wrong bride home. meanwhile, his wife ends up lost, having to fend for herself.it's a satire looking at the treatment of women, including touching on the sensitive topic of domestic violence.khan describes the plot as ""a bit shakespearean"", with its focus on humour and mistaken identities.but, he adds, it's saying ""a lot of important things about women's issues, their independence, their right to decide for themselves what they want to do"".it was these issues that drew him to the film in the first place, he explains.""every now and then you get an opportunity as a creative person to actually also sensitise people about certain issues that we face in society,"" he says.""women all over the world have been subjected to a lot of challenges in their lives. women have a raw deal in life. so i felt that here is a story which really brings that out well in such a nice way, which is why i wanted to produce it."" khan was also ""very keen"" that his ex-wife, kiran rao, should direct the film.the pair, who married in 2005, announced their separation in 2021. but they have remained close, both professionally and personally.""i think the reason i chose kiran was because i knew that she would be very honest with it and that's what i wanted,"" he says.""we get along really well. we really love each other, we respect each other.""our relationship may have changed slightly – but that doesn't mean what we feel for each other has gone down or something.""that's not to say it's all been plain sailing, however.khan admits there were arguments on set.""we can't make a film without an argument. so we argue every point and we have strong opinions,"" he says.""but our sensibilities are very similar. we are not talking about fundamental things. we are just trying to sometimes convince the other person a better way of conveying something."" bollywood produces hundreds of films every year and has a huge following among indians globally.the sway the films and stars have on their fans' imagination cannot be overstated.it has had recent success at the academy awards, with naatu naatu from rrr winning best original song and the elephant whisperers awarded best documentary short film.but victory in the international film category has so far eluded it, something khan attributes to the competition.""india has made really great films over the years. occasionally it's a matter of the right film not getting sent or the best film not getting sent,"" he says.""but otherwise we have to understand that the films you're competing against - you're not competing against five or six films, you're competing against almost 80 or 90 films, which are the best in the world.""as to whether a bollywood film could one day scoop the best overall film award, khan says it is ""possible"".but indian film-makers would first need to start making movies for a global market, he adds.""i've never really looked at an international audience,"" he says. ""we have such a large audience of our own that it doesn't come in to our mind.""that will only happen when indians start making films for a world audience. i don't think we have the bandwidth for it right now."" for now, khan is focusing on a range of projects alongside laapataa ladies, which also include his next film sitaare zameen par, due for release in 2025.looking further out, he's hoping to make one film a year, while his ""dream project"" is to take on mahabharat - the ancient indian epic.but since unretiring from film, he is determined to do things differently. again, this was influenced by his children.""my son said, 'you're an extreme person',"" he says.""he said, 'you're like a pendulum. you only did films, films, films. and now you want to swing to the other side and do no films and be with family, family, family. there is a middle place also you can think about'.""khan says his son told him to ""try and bring some balance"" into his life.""and i thought he was right. so since then, that's what i've been trying to do - living a balanced life where i'm working really hard, in fact i'm doing much more work that i ever did, but i don't work after 6 o'clock any more.""khan says he has also started therapy in recent years, inspired by his daughter ira, who works in mental health.""i think that's something that's really helped me. that's really helped me understand myself better.""i'm actually finding that balance between work and a personal life. so i feel that i've reached that space now.""watch aamir khan: the interview on the bbc news channel and bbc iplayer.",7117,"bollywood superstar aamir khan is known for some of india's most popular films, including lagaan and 3 idiots.so great is his appeal, he can barely walk down the street without getting mobbed by fans.what's less well known is that he secretly quit films during the covid pandemic in order to spend more time with his loved ones.

"Nato must switch to a wartime mindset, warns secretary generalMark Rutte urged members to ""turbocharge"" their defence spending to prevent future war with Russia.4 days agoEurope",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly41x7eg71o,"the head of nato has said it is time to ""shift to a wartime mindset"", as he warned the military alliance's members were not spending enough to prepare for the threat of a future conflict with russia.secretary general mark rutte said moscow was ""preparing for long-term confrontation with ukraine and with us"", describing the current security situation as the worst in his lifetime.""we are not ready for what is coming our way in four to five years,"" he said in his first major speech since becoming secretary general in october, urging members to ""turbocharge"" their defence spending.his comments come weeks before president-elect donald trump takes office, havingpreviously suggestedthe us would not protect nato allies that were failing to spend enough on defence. nato members have pledged to spend at least 2% of the value of their economies - measured by gdp - on defence per year by 2024.but speaking at an event in brussels, the former dutch prime minister said ""a lot more"" would be needed as danger ""[moves] towards us at full speed"".he said european members had spent upwards of 3% of gdp on defence during the cold war.""if we don't spend more together now to prevent war, we will pay a much, much, much higher price later to fight it,"" he said.he added that russia's economy was ""on a war footing"", with its defence spend by 2025 set to be ""a third of russia's state budget – and the highest level since the cold war"".russia has significantly increased its defence spending since launching its full-scale invasion of ukraine, with record levels approved for 2025.rutte spoke ata critical juncture in the war in ukraine,with russian forces grinding forward in the east of the country. by november, moscow had seized six times as much ukrainian territory in 2024compared with the whole of 2023.while the average defence spend for nato members in europe and canada is estimated at 2%, not all meet the target.trump said in february that he would""encourage"" russia to attack any nato member that fails to pay its billsas part of the western military alliance.nato's 32 members in europe and north america agree that if one member is attacked, the others should help defend them. speaking to the bbc following his speech on thursday, rutte said: ""donald trump was completely right when in his first term he forced us to spend more, he was successful, we are considerably spending more than before he became president, so in that sense he was totally right.""this is why some in nato call rutte ""the trump whisperer"". and that, they say, is a very big reason he was chosen as nato secretary general.back in 2018, then president trump famously threatened the us would ""go our own way"" if other nato members - essentially in europe - did not spend more on their own militaries. then dutch prime minister rutte was credited with reasoning with the us president, assuring him that spending had already gone up and that he, president trump, was the reason for it.and now trump is poised to return to the white house and rutte wants to keep the us committed to nato and european defence. so rutte's messaging to trump is once again to flatter him.as a former prime minister, rutte well knows that europe's leaders hesitate to spend much more on defence because voters across the continent have other priorities - rising living costs, health, migration.that, he told the bbc, is why he aimed his speech today as his ""plea"" to ""people"".""i'm really pleading directly to the one billion people living in nato territory, and particularly in canada and europe, to ask them to help me,"" rutte said.""call up your politicians, tell them that you agree that yes it is difficult, it will mean somewhat less spending on some other items, but that you want them, your politicians, to prioritise defence, because this is long-term crucial…""my plea here is if you have children, grandchildren, if you think our way of life should be preserved, the democracy, our values, then we have to prioritise defence.""and if we don't, in four or five years we are in real difficulty.""",4056,"the head of nato has said it is time to ""shift to a wartime mindset"", as he warned the military alliance's members were not spending enough to prepare for the threat of a future conflict with russia.secretary general mark rutte said moscow was ""preparing for long-term confrontation with ukraine and with us"", describing the current security situation as the worst in his lifetime. so rutte's messaging to trump is once again to flatter him.as a former prime minister, rutte well knows that europe's leaders hesitate to spend much more on defence because voters across the continent have other priorities -

Artists imagine a new utopia for Kenya's capitalCreatives in Nairobi unleash their imaginations in an effort to inspire a new future for the city.30 Nov 2024Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4vk5y4ng5o,"kenya’s capital, nairobi, has long been known as “the green city in the sun” because of its mix of forest and grasslands among the urban sprawl, but it all depends on where you are viewing it from.seen from one of the city’s comfortable apartment blocks or homes, then yes, perhaps – from one of its densely packed slums, then no.there, life can be characterised by poverty and ecological disaster, such as flooding and deadly landslides.but an art collective - kairos futura – has been trying to take what might seem like some of the city’s more dystopian elements and create a vision of a utopia, or at least how that might be achieved.their exhibition hakuna utopia features the works of seven artists exploring themes of apocalypse and resilience – some in quite abstract ways - as they respond to the daily challenges endured by nairobi’s six million residents. one of the collective, stoneface bombaa, grew up in mathare, the capital’s second-largest informal settlement.he has overcome great odds to become an artist and wants to use his work to address the way that people in mathare live – often lacking jobs, housing and education.bombaa says they endure a “hand-to-mouth economy”, never sure where their next meal will come from.“people are really angry,” he says, but through art, he feels he can “channel” his community’s anger into something positive as “art unites”.bombaa set out to create from the exhibitions “micro-utopia” sites dotted around the city.he called it the “jungle room” and hoped to get people to connect with nature from within mathare itself, in an attempt to bridge the ecological divide.ironically, the building he had identified as a possible site was demolished by the authorities to make way for a road. undeterred, he has been taking children from his community, often stuck living in unimaginable urban squalor, to experience nairobi’s verdant parks and expose them to green spaces.“there are no trees or green spaces in mathare,” bombaa says.but by contemplating the idea of utopia, he believes that he can imagine what it would be like if people in his community actually had unrestricted access to the city’s green spaces.in this way, people in his community can claim a right to access nature that is denied to them simply because they are poor. bombaa also complains about how ordinary nairobians, often scrabbling to make a living, have to pay to enter some of their city’s most beautiful locations such as the arboretum or karura forest.the kairos futura team are also drawing inspiration from nature to use their imagination in how to address urgent environmental issues.for example, coltrane mcdowell has applied this to architecture.in his work invisible cities, he was inspired by termite mounds to reimagine what architecture might look like in the future. another artist in the show, abdul rop, known for his mesmerising woodcut prints and paintings, says that in order to “achieve utopia”, nairobians need to work together.“that's why the young people are agitating right now for change,” he says, suggesting they are frustrated by a corrupt political system that hems in their potential.gen z were at the forefront of proteststhis year against new tax measures, which saw the government make an embarrassing u-turn.rop argues that by thinking about utopia through the lens of art, young people may find creative ways to fight for their future.rather than being far-fetched, he thinks that it can help imagine a bolder and more equal future for his city.“the moment to act for the future is now,” he says. the ghanaian artist clothing london's brutalist iconhow old ugandan negatives are bringing families back to lifethe continent through its own lens‘bipolar, colour and me’ -

"A decade since Canada opened its doors, Syrians reflect on home away from homeSyrians in Canada reflect on a decade in the country1 day agoWorld",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kev3k49gwo,"it started with just a small group gathered in mississauga's celebration square, rejoicingthat 10,000 km (6,200 miles) away, the syrian city of homs had fallen to rebel forces.but when news broke that president bashar al-assad had fled the country, putting an end to the country's civil war, this town square in a small canadian city became flooded with people celebrating,many of whom had fled assad's regime for canada just a decade ago.""i was crying for more than 45 minutes,"" said khaled abdulwahed, a 31-year-old syrian who resettled in toronto when he was just a young man and helped organise sunday's impromptu event.now a canadian citizen, mr abdulwahed - who was 17 when he first participated in anti-government protests in syria - has continued to advocate for the human-rights of his country, which has earned him the title of the ""syrian mayor of toronto"".while many have begun to plan trips to see family and friends, they have also shared how canada will, for most of them, remain home.""right now, is our turn to help our people, to rebuild our country and to support them from here,"" he said. mr abdulwahed was part of a wave of syrian refugees who came to canada between 2015-2016, backed by a campaign promise from newly elected prime minister justin trudeau to help resettle 25,000 syrians at a time when many were dying trying to flee their country.canada's warm welcome stood in sharp contrast to their neighbour's to the south, where donald trump was running his first presidential campaign on a promise to ban muslims from entering the country. he would later try toban immigration from seven muslim-majority countries.like mr abdulwahed, muzna dureid was forced to make the journey to canada by herself when she was a young woman.within the first three months of the revolution, the then-21-year-old witnessed her brother's arrest, her social media accounts hacked by assad intelligence officers and an uncle's assassination for his pro-democracy activities.""this was the tipping point,"" she said on a call from her older brother's new home in spain. he was released a year after the arrest, but the family had by that point fled damascus and spread out across the world.while ms dureid's parents stayed in saudi arabia, she managed to secure a fellowship in turkey before landing another one in 2016 to study in montreal.a call-out on facebook for a couch to stay on soon transformed into a lifelong bond. the quebec family who put her up for that first night - and continued to for that first year - would later go on to privately-sponsor the rest of her family to join her in canada. since 1979, canadians have helped resettleover 390,000 refugeesthrough private sponsorship - which differs from government-assisted programmes as the cost of resettlement is borne by an individual or group.as canada raced to resettle syrians fleeing the war, it proved to be essential in meeting that goal; nearly half arrived through some form of private sponsorship, according to thegovernment of canada.canada's has gone on to resettlemore than 100,000 syrians,all through a mixture of government-assisted and private sponsorships.it is a small number compared to how many refugees countries around syria - namely turkey, lebanon and jordan - took in since the syrian civil war began in 2011. but their warm welcome in canada has helped make them feel like an integral part of their new community, ms dureid said.""this is why people believe they belong to this country, not for a temporary period, but that this is their country,"" she said.the human-rights activist and policy advisor, who has worked with canada's ministry for gender equality, says that now that assad is gone, she'll likely split her time between syria and canada.""my dream is to have a ministry for gender equality in syria and be part of this work,"" she said.""i think a lot of us are gonna be between both countries and serving both countries equally.""but there are signs that canada's doors-open attitude has been shifting in recent years, with trudeau's government moving to reduce the number of permanent residents in the country as it grapples with a persistent cost of living and housing crisis.it is unclear what effect - if any - this would have on canada's refugee resettlement programme. in 2023, the country became the fifth-largest recipient of asylum seekers worldwide. maya almasalmeh, a sociology student at western university, was just 17 years old when she arrived in london, ontario with her family in 2016.in the syrian city of deraa, she lost her grandfather - ""a second father figure"" - along with her home amidst the siege on the city, which would come to be known as the birthplace of the uprising against assad.""he stole our childhood,"" she said.being the eldest daughter of seven siblings in an immigrant home, she said, meant that she also viewed herself as a second parent figure to her many brothers and sisters. and that sense of responsibility extends beyond her front door in london.""canada is the country that gave us peace, it [gave] me my education and helped me to develop to the person who i am today,"" ms almasalmeh said. but, she stressed, we ""will go back"" to help ""build the new generation.""she goes on to outline in great detail her long-term goals.""i want to be a social worker, because the people who helped us in the beginning, it was a lot of kind social workers,"" she explained, noting that her ""second home"" of deraa will need people with her skills to rebuild.but like ms dureid and mr abdulwahed, the 25-year-old doesn't foresee syria becoming a permanent base.""canada is our home. i would say, it's our heart,"" she said. ""we will never forget how canada gave us the chance to live happy again."" yet some of those celebrating are also exercising a heavy level of caution before booking flights to see distant relatives.""edmonton - this is my home. this is where my family is,"" explained 36-year-old basel abou hamrah, who resettled in the canadian prairies with his mother and three siblings in late 2015.mr abou hamrah said there are concerns when he thinks about going back to syria. part of his struggles when he first arrived in edmonton stemmed from the fact that he hadn't yet come out to his family as gay.there is also uncertainty about what the future holds for syria, which was liberated by an islamist rebel group that was once an off-shoot of al-qaeda, though it had rebranded itself in recent years.questions have swirled on what type of government the group would form, and how much freedoms syrians will have under this new leadership.""it's not safe for lgbtq refugee people back home in syria,"" he explained.prior to the 2011 revolution, there were reports of gay menbeing targeted by police.mr abou hamrah said this is why the news this week, that some european countries are choosing topause asylum decisionsfor syrian refugees, causes him grave concern.""there are lots of lgbtq refugees that - no matter what is the new government of the new syria - they will not be safe,"" mr abou hamrah said, citing how the situation in the country is still in ""flux"". moving back to syria on a more permanent basis may be, for others, the news they've been waiting to hear since the civil war pushed them from their homes years ago.""canada gave us safety and dignity,"" explained israa el issa, a mother of four, from her home in prince george, british columbia.

The dark fandom behind healthcare CEO murder suspectOnline adulation painting Luigi Mangione as a folk hero and fuelled by health system anger has worried authorities.3 days agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8nk75vg81o,"they came in hoodies, they came in masks, shuffling their feet and laughing nervously while waiting for a winner to be announced.just a few days after unitedhealthcare ceo brian thompson was murdered on a new york city sidewalk, these young men had lined up in washington square park to compete in a lookalike contest for the man wanted for his murder.it was sparsely attended and seen as a joke by those who did turn up, said talia jane, a journalist who was there.but it underlined an obsession with a murder suspect that has gripped social media since the killing on 4 december, fuelled by latent anger directed at america's private health insurers.""there was a lot of tinder already there, a lot of discontent, a lot of frustration already there, and [this] sort of threw a match on it,"" ms jane said.and it has only grown since the suspect was named as luigi mangione, a 26-year-old ivy league-educated member of a prominent baltimore family.tracing the powerful family roots of suspected killer luigi mangionein tiktok videos, memes and group chats, a young man accused of shooting a father-of-two in the back on a new york city sidewalk has been fawned over and praised as a kind of folk hero.this fetishisation was remarkably widespread, not limited to radical corners of the internet or any political affiliation, troubling many observers.""we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,"" said josh shapiro, the governor of pennsylvania, where mr mangione was arrested at a mcdonald's.""in a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice."" almost immediately after mr thompson was shot dead, the internet began to lionise his suspected killer. on tiktok, people posted videos of a ""ceo assassin"" new york city walking tour. on spotify, playlists dedicated to the suspect started to appear.once mr mangione was arrested, these fans came to his defence.the start of his legal battles prompted anonymous donors to chip in thousands of dollars towards his defence through various online fundraisers.etsy was flooded with pro-mangione apparel, while amazon pulled similar products from their site.the mcdonald's worker alleged to have turned him in has become a target for online hate, while the fast-food franchise itself has been spammed with bad reviews.the police department in altoona, pennsylvania, that arrested him even received death threats.much of this online reaction has focused on his looks, with the internet dubbing him the ""hot assassin"".indeed, mr mangione's appearance, which he showed off in shirtless social media posts, is now clearly part of the appeal, said cultural critic blakely thornton.americans are effectively ""programmed"" to trust and empathise with men who look like mr mangione, he said.""that's why they are the protagonists in our movies, books and stories.""public adoration for handsome menaccused of crimes is not new -

four-fifths - contained criticism of the healthcare system.mr mangione's x account has gained more than 400,000 followers since the shooting.the shooting also seemed to inspire others to take action against healthcare insurers - ""wanted"" posters of other ceos appeared around new york city,and a woman in florida was arrestedafter telling an insurance agent on the phone ""delay, deny, depose. you people are next,"" alluding to the words inscribed on bullet casings found at the murder scene.alex goldenberg, a senior adviser at the ncri, called the online reaction a ""turning point"" and ""a catalyst for the normalisation of political violence that was once confined to extremists on the fringes"".he compared the wave of comments to the online activity following racist mass murders, designed to defend the killers and signal-boost their beliefs - only more widespread, and happening across mainstream social media networks.""the dynamic we are observing is eerily similar to the activity on platforms like 4chan, 8chan, discord, and in other dark corners of the internet, where mass shootings are often met with glee,"" he said.tim weninger, a computer science professor at notre dame and expert in social media and artificial intelligence, said evidence suggests that the groundswell was authentic - not powered by bots or government influence operations.""people are pissed off at the healthcare industry and they are using social media to express their frustrations,"" he said. ""they're expressing those frustrations by supporting this suspect."" recent research by commonwealth fund, a health policy institute, found 45% of insured working-age adults were charged for something they thought should have been free or covered by insurance, and 17% of respondents said their insurer denied coverage for care that was recommended by their doctor.there are indications that the shooting has prompted some introspection on the part of healthcare companies.""i think all of us are taking a step back and trying to understand what's happening with patients and their experiences,"" pfizer's chief sustainability officer caroline roan told a conference in new york on wednesday, according to reuters. some of the people who have been protesting against health insurance companies for years, before online criticism about uhc took off, understand some of the darker sentiments, even if they don't endorse them.""it's a horrific act of violence, and i absolutely condemn it no matter the motivation,"" jenn coffey, who has been fighting to get uhc to cover her medical bills, said of mr thompson's killing. ""but i'm not shocked by the reaction."" ms coffey, 53, from manchester, new hampshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 and later fell ill with complex regional pain syndrome, a potentially debilitating neurological condition. when a doctor suggested that she try ketamine therapy, her uhc insurance would not cover the procedure, she said. she has since become involved in a protest campaign organised by activist group people's action.ms coffey's illness forced her to stop working as an emergency medical technician. she said she started a crowdfunding drive and had to sell most of her belongings in order to pay for the treatment herself.""i get to have some normality. i can sit up and paint, or i can enjoy a meal with my family"" because of the treatment, she said. ""i can have a life that's worth living.""unitedhealth group told the bbc they could not comment on individual cases for privacy reasons.at the same time, much of the online discussion has effectively ignored the victim, brian thompson, who was 50.""it's incredibly bleak that [thompson's death] hasn't been covered as much because, bottom line, a person died, a person was murdered,"" blakely thornton said.""the collective rage over [the healthcare industry] is really outweighing what is still a tragedy."" in his last post on linkedin, mr thompson talked about efforts to make healthcare more affordable - and was criticised in the comments. cbs news, the bbc's us partner, obtained a message that unitedhealth ceo andrew witty sent to staff this week, memorialising mr thompson and calling his murdered colleague ""one of the good guys"".""he was certainly one of the smartest guys. i think he was one of the best guys. i'm going to miss him. and i am incredibly proud to call him my friend,"" he wrote.in the email, the company shared messages from customers, including one who wrote about recovering from cancer, saying their treatment was paid for by the insurance company's benefits.""i'm thankful to uhc and everyone there who works within a broken system to help as many people as they can,"" they wrote, according to the company.another message said: ""so very sad that this world is so hateful. i have always had great experiences with uhc.""ms coffey, the uhc policyholder and patient, said: ""my heart goes out to the family and i can't imagine what they're having to struggle with that [killing]. it's awful to me that this is the catalyst for this debate.""""i would have much rather sat down and had a conversation with him.""with additional reporting from grace dean",9539,"""we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,"" said josh shapiro, the governor of pennsylvania, where mr mangione was arrested at a mcdonald's.

How Luigi Mangione's legal defence could take shapePolice believe forensic and ballistic evidence ties the suspect to insurance CEO Brian Thompson's killing.5 days agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm987p8xz3o,"forensic and ballistic evidence that police say ties the accused murderer of healthcare insurance ceo brian thompson to the crime scene will make it difficult for his lawyers to mount a defence, former prosecutors and other legal experts say.luigi mangione, 26, was arrested in pennsylvania on monday after a days-long, multi-state manhunt ended at a mcdonalds in the town of altoona.new york authorities say fingerprints and shell casings link him to the crime scene.his lawyer, thomas dickey, earlier told local media he had not ""seen any evidence yet"" implicating his client. he said mr mangione would plead not guilty to the charges he faces in pennsylvania, including firearms charges.in new york, he has been charged with second-degree murder over mr thompson's killing and it is not clear how he would plead. he is currently being held in a state prison in pennsylvania where he is fighting extradition to face that murder charge. the legal battle over his extradition could potentially take more than a month to resolve, officials said.but legal experts told the bbc that his efforts to contest his extradition to new york are unlikely to be successful. they could, however, provide his defence with a glimpse into the state's evidence against him.""i don't even know if this is him,"" his lawyer, mr dickey, said in a recent interview with us media outlet newsnation, referring to images of mr thompson's killer.""we're going to test those waters and give the government a chance to bring some evidence forward,"" he said.how the six-day manhunt unfoldedwhat is a ghost gun, the weapon allegedly used in shooting?who is the ceo shooting suspect?who was unitedhealthcare ceo brian thompson?if he is extradited to new york to face the murder charge, mitchell epner, a new york-based lawyer and former prosecutor, told the bbc that  there are, broadly, two approaches that mr mangione could take if he pleads not guilty.""defence number one is 'it wasn't me' and defence number two is 'it was me, but i shouldn't be punished' because of x,"" he said.according to new york police, mr mangione was found with a gun similar to the murder weapon, a silencer and a fake id, as well as three handwritten pages which they believe suggest a potential motive.mr epner said that the publicly known evidence so far means denying responsibility is ""out the window"".another new york-based lawyer, criminal defence attorney and professor dmitriy shakhnevich, said mr mangione's attorney could also, in theory, argue that an impaired ""mental status"" makes him unfit to stand trial.""if a judge makes a determination that he's misunderstanding, or not understanding, what's happening in court, then essentially the case won't go forward,"" he  said.""he'll be institutionalised for a period of time until he's deemed to be fit, which may be never.""that defence, mr shakhnevich added, is different to a plea of insanity, in which his lawyers could argue that ""he's not responsible for his actions because of some mental defect"".""that could also deem him not guilty, because you won't satisfy the elements of the offence,"" he said.
