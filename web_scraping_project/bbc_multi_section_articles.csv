US players to be paid Â£400k for playing in Ryder Cup,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/clyg859jed5o,"Players on next year's United States Ryder Cup team will be paid to compete after a package was agreed by the PGA of America.It will be the first time in the 98-year history of the matches that either side has been paid to play.The 12 players will each receive $500,000 (Â£400,000), with $300,000 (Â£240,000) donated to a charity or charities chosen by each member of the team.The PGA of America, which organises the event, approved the package despite saying ""no players asked to be compensated"".Six players will qualify automatically via the US Ryder Cup points list and captain Keegan Bradley will make six wildcard selections.""The players and captains, past and present, are responsible for the Ryder Cup becoming the most special competition in golf and one of the most in-demand events on the international sports scene,"" the PGA of America said in a statement.Last year's contest in Rome was marked by Patrick Cantlay not wearing the American team cap in what wasreported to be a protest,externalat the fact the players were not being remunerated to compete.Europe's Rory McIlroy said last month he would pay to play in the matches, which will be held at Bethpage in New York.""I personally would pay for the privilege to play on the Ryder Cup,""McIlroy told BBC Sport.""The two purest forms of competition in our game right now are the Ryder Cup and the Olympics, and it's partly because of that, the purity of no money being involved."" Europe won the 2023 Ryder Cupin Rome, where Cantlay's cap stance led to home fans removing their headwear as he approached in an attempt to taunt the American.It ultimately led to a spat between McIlroy and Cantlay's caddie Joe LaCava, who waved his cap close to the Northern Irishman as he lined up a putt after his player had holed a long effort on the 18th in a match against the four-time major champion and Matt Fitzpatrick.That episode spilled into angry scenes in the car park at Marco Simone afterwards, which McIlroy and captain Luke Donald said fired up Europe for Sunday's singles.""I don't think any of the 24 players on either team needs 400 grand,"" McIlroy said.""Every two years, there are 104 weeks and 103 weeks you can play golf and get paid.""Europe, who have not won on American soil since 2012, will again be captained in 2025 by Donald."
Does sacking a manager help you avoid relegation?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0kv7ym5k2vo,"Two of the clubs in the Premier League decided to roll the dice on Sunday by sacking their managers.Southampton, nine points adrift and bottom, axed Russell Martin - the manager who got them promoted last season.Wolves, five points off safety, sacked Gary O'Neil after a season and a half in charge.But does sacking a manager help to bring about survival when a team are in the relegation zone? Not counting this season, there have been 91 times when a team have parted company with their manager while in the drop zone - and on 36 of those occasions they avoided relegation.That is a success rate of 40%, so we know the difficult decision can work.Of those 36 cases, five of the teams were exactly five points adrift when the manager left, like Wolves.Sam Allardyce kept up two of those five teams - Blackburn in 2008-09 and Sunderland in 2015-16.Tony Parkes, as a caretaker, saved Blackburn from such a perilous position in 1996-97, while Harry Redknapp saw Tottenham to safety in 2008-09.Tony Pulis helped Crystal Palace avoid the drop in 2013-14, although by the time he took over from caretaker Keith Millen they were only three points off safety.Only one of those five instances happened this late in a season, though - when Blackburn sacked Paul Ince on 16 December 2008 and hired Allardyce two days later.The other four changes with teams five points adrift all happened in October.One good omen for Wolves is that they were the second most recent team who changed managers while in the bottom three and stayed up.That was when Julen Lopetegui replaced Bruno Lage - via Steve Davis' caretaker spell - just before the 2022 World Cup. Um...No team have ever had a change of manager when nine points adrift (or anything more than five points) and stayed up.In fact, only two teams have ever stayed up after being nine points or more from safety at any stage of the season.They are Blackburn in 1996-97 - a week or so after Parkes replaced Ray Harford - and West Ham in 2006-07.The Hammers, who replaced Alan Pardew with Alan Curbishley earlier that season, were 10 points adrift with nine games to go - but they won seven of those to stay up.Changing manager while in the drop zone has worked for Southampton three times - when Ian Branfoot left in 1993-94, Stuart Gray left in 2001-02 and Mark Hughes exited in 2018-19.But the tactic failed for them twice in 2022-23 when first Ralph Hasenhuttl in November and then Nathan Jones in February left.But in none of those instances were they in this big of a mess.We also now know Southampton will be bottom of the table at Christmas - with only four previous teams having survived from that position in Premier League history.West Bromwich Albion (2004-05), Sunderland (2013-14), Leicester (2014-15) and Wolves (2022-23) are the four sides to manage it. Looking more recently - in the five seasons previous to this campaign, 16 teams parted company with their manager while in the relegation zone. Only five of them stayed up.Last season the same three teams spent most of the season in the bottom three - Burnley, Luton and Sheffield United.The Blades changed manager but the other two did not - and they all went down."
UK Sport invests record Â£330m for 2028 LA Games,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cjr2lgj0x31o,"Elite sport funding body UK Sport says it will invest a record Â£330m in Britain's Olympic and Paralympic sports for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.More than 50 sports will benefit, though athletics has had its budget reduced for the second cycle running.Five new sports for the 2028 Games - baseball/softball, flag football, lacrosse, Para-climbing and squash - have all received funding.Breaking, which featured for the first time at the Paris Games this summer, is no longer eligible for support after it was axed from the Olympic programme.The total figure will top Â£400m with the addition of athlete performance awards (APAs), which are paid directly to individual athletes and contribute to their living and sporting costs so they can focus on competing - about Â£70m was awarded in APAs in the Paris funding cycle, which totalled Â£385m.Sally Munday, chief executive officer of UK Sport, told BBC Sport funding should not be looked at as either a ""reward"" or a ""punishment"" for performances at the Paris Games.""The decision that we've made against all the sports is we've looked at their potential,"" said Munday.""UK Athletics will receive in excess of Â£30m for the Olympic and Paralympic programmes and we believe that's going to put them in a great place to support their athletes in the lead into LA.""Jack Buckner, CEO of UK Athletics, said the organisation was ""disappointed"" with the decision to reduce the sport's share by Â£1.725m, and highlighted the 10 medals at both the World Championships in 2023 and this year's Olympics ""deserved a higher level of investment"".Canoeing was another sport to have its funding cut, by more than Â£500,000. When the total funding for the Paris 2024 cycle is taken into account, modern pentathlon and equestrian have received a smaller budget, but rowing has increased to Â£24.85m from Â£22.72m, despite a cut between Tokyo and Paris.Meanwhile, British Basketball Federation chair Chris Grant said the sport ""has entered a new era"" with an award of Â£2.925m, primarily to help develop the 3x3 format of the game.Great Britain won 65 medals at this year's Games and 124 medals at the Paralympics.They finished seventh in the Olympic medal table, behind the Netherlands in sixth and fifth-placed France, but Munday said the aim is to be ""consistently top five"".""We'll be really forensic - were there contributing factors that we could do differently to make sure that we don't find ourselves in that position again?"" said Munday.""We will be leaving no stone unturned to make sure that we've really understood what the factors are as to why we came seventh. But we're very clear we want to be consistently top five."""
Stokes blow compounds England slide towards defeat,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cdxzlr1790xo,"Third Test, Hamilton (day three of five)New Zealand 347(Santner 76; Potts 4-90)& 453(Williamson 156, Young 60, Mitchell 60)England 143(Henry 4-48, Santner 3-7, O'Rourke 3-33)& 18-2England need 640 runs to winScorecard England's slide towards a massive defeat in the third Test against New Zealand was compounded by a concerning recurrence of Ben Stokes' hamstring injury.Stokes was in visible distress as he left the field clutching the same left hamstring he injured in August, subsequently missing four Tests.The captain was bowling his third over of the third day, midway through the afternoon session. He pulled up in the follow-through of his second delivery, went straight to the dressing room and did not return for the remainder of the New Zealand second innings. The all-rounder will have a scan overnight.Even before Stokes was injured, England were staring down the barrel as an inevitable Kane Williamson century built New Zealand's monstrous lead.After rain delayed play by two and a half hours, Williamson moved to 156. He added 107 with Rachin Ravindra, who made 44, and another 92 with Daryl Mitchell, who helped himself to 60.When New Zealand were finally bowled out for 453, England's target was a world-record and improbable 658.England were left six overs to bat, in which time Ben Duckett played an awful hack to drag on off the retiring Tim Southee and Zak Crawley was lbw to his tormentor Matt Henry.The tourists will resume on 18-2 when play gets under way at the earlier time of 10:30 (21:30 GMT Monday) on day four.Dry weather is forecast for days four and five, giving New Zealand plenty of time to salvage a consolation victory from a series England have already won.For England, the bigger worry is Stokes' fitness. This is a devastating blow for Stokes, whose progress from left-knee surgery at the end of last year has now been hit by two hamstring injuries in the space of five months.The first, sustained playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred, ruled him out of the home series against Sri Lanka and first Test in Pakistan. Stokes later admitted the mental toll the battle to get fit in Pakistan took on him, made worse by a break-in at his home while he was away.The captain has looked near to his best in New Zealand, the country of his birth, both as a leader and a player.The 33-year-old had been able to play a full role as a fourth seamer, but it is the repeat injury after such a bowling workload that is the cause for alarm.The 23 overs he bowled on the first day of this Test are the most he has bowled in a single day, his 36.2 overs in the match his most since June 2022 and the 66.1 overs in the series his most as captain.Stokes pulled up with a back problem during the first Test in Christchurch, though was able to stay on the field. His immediate reaction here was an instant indication of the severity of the issue.As Ravindra hoiked to mid-on, Stokes hobbled off, covering his face as he left. Ollie Pope, already standing-in as wicketkeeper, took over as captain.Stokes had treatment and will be assessed further before England make a decision on whether he bats in the second innings.His spell with MI Cape Town in the SA T20 in January will surely be cancelled and any slim prospect of a return to the England one-day team for the Champions Trophy is over. More important are the questions over his long-term prospects as a Test bowler. When New Zealand resumed on 136-3, leading by 340, England's prospects were already bleak and Williamson mercilessly removed any semblance of hope.On his home ground, Williamson racked up his seventh century and nudged his average at Seddon Park to 94.94. From 50 overnight, he was watchful and correct, mainly waiting for England to drop short in order to cut to the square boundary.On 73, Williamson survived the tightest lbw shout from Brydon Carse and on 80 miscued Shoaib Bashir over Carse at mid-wicket. On 86, a pull at a Stokes bouncer was parried by Pope flying down the leg side. It would have been a magnificent catch.When Stokes was injured he was replaced in the attack by left-arm spinner Jacob Bethell, whom Williamson hit for six over long-on to go to his 33rd Test hundred. The action simply became about how many runs New Zealand wanted to amass.Williamson seemed nailed for a double, only to sweep Bashir to sub fielder Rehan Ahmed at deep square leg. Mitchell holed out to long-off to become Bethell's first Test wicket.The futility of New Zealand continuing to grow their lead bordered on farce. England spared their seamers and Harry Brook bowled with the second new ball.The crowd chanted for Southee and got their wish after Mitchell Santner was out for 49, including five sixes. England gave Southee his second guard of honour of the match, his quest to add to his 98 career sixes ended by lofting Bethell to long-on. Next ball, Bethell bowled Henry to end with 3-72.Zak Crawley overturned being given out leg before to Henry from the fifth ball of the innings, before Duckett's ridiculous charge at Southee.There was still time for Henry to get Crawley for the sixth time in six innings in the series. Crawley ends with a series average of 8.66 â no England opener has ever batted as much in a single series and ended with a lower average."
Austria striker's skull is fractured during attack,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpvnjp4p407o,"Austria striker Guido Burgstaller had his skull fractured when he was attacked in the centre of the country's capital city, his club Rapid Vienna have said.Rapid said the 35-year-old is expected to be out of action for several months after suffering the ""serious head injury"" at the weekend.They say the former Cardiff City forward was attacked by an ""unknown man"" and fractured his skull as he fell following a ""brutal blow"".The 35-year-old, capped 26 times by Austria, was examined at the scene before being taken to hospital, where he will remain for the next few days.In a statement, Rapid said they ""trust in the responsible authorities that the as-yet-unknown perpetrator will be brought to justice quickly"".Burgstaller joined Cardiff from Rapid in 2014, becoming Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's second signing for the Welsh club.He made just three appearances for the Bluebirds before joining German club Nurnberg.Burgstaller also played in Germany for Schalke and St Pauli before returning to Rapid in 2022.He was one of three Austria players dropped by manager Ralf Rangnick in 2023 after they were filmed singing homophobic chants following a 3-0 win against city rivals Austria Vienna."
Australia on top against India but rain ruins day three,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c5y49rqzdyjo,"Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Third Test, Brisbane (day three of five)Australia 445:Head 152, Smith 101, Carey 70; Bumrah 6-76India 51-4:Starc 2-25Australia lead by 394 runsScorecard Australia's seamers ensured they stayed in control of the third Test against India, despite rain decimating much of day three in Brisbane.The hosts added 40 runs, either side of a rain delay, to their overnight 405-7, with Alex Carey the last man out for 70.India's reply was delayed by more rain, before they slipped to 22-3.Yashasvi Jaiswal hit Mitchell Starc for four off the first ball of the innings, but was caught at mid-wicket next ball.Shubman Gill was superbly caught at gully by Mitchell Marsh, before Virat Kohli feathered Josh Hazlewood behind.The rain returned as Rishabh Pant was walking to the crease and then much of the afternoon and evening session was wiped out by more precipitation, a wet outfield and bad light.There were four spells of cricket - with each lasting 11, 23, seven and 17 balls respectively.Pant was dismissed in the third of those, edging Pat Cummins behind, before KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma guided India to 51-4 at stumps.While 98 overs can be bowled on each of the remaining days, a result may be difficult to achieve withmore rain forecast.The five-match series is level at 1-1 afterAustralia's 10-wicket win in Adelaidelast week.India must win at least two of the final three Tests to guarantee a place in June's World Test Championship final at Lord's.Defending champions Australia will reach the final if they win two of the remaining Tests."
Allen stars in Bills epic & Mahomes limps out of Chiefs win,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/c70ex875l27o,"Josh Allen produced another sensational display in another Buffalo Bills epic on Sunday, while the Kansas City Chiefs' latest victory may have come at a huge cost.The defending champions enjoyed their biggest win of the season but saw star quarterback Patrick Mahomes limp out of the game with a worrying ankle injury.Buffalo have no such worries over their own superstar Allen, who again showed why he is the Most Valuable Player favourite as the Bills ended the Detroit Lions' 11-game winning run in another high-scoring thriller.The Pittsburgh Steelers lost at the Philadelphia Eagles but still secured their spot in the play-offs, as did the Houston Texans, while the Minnesota Vikings joined them without even playing. Just a week after losing 44-42 at the Rams, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills came out on top this time in another blockbuster - edging the Lions 48-42 in Detroit.Billed as a potential Super Bowl preview, the top two scorers in the NFL put on a show worthy of the big game, with their two banged-up defences unable to shackle Allen or Lions quarterback Jared Goff.Goff threw five touchdowns but was always playing from behind after Allen's two quick rushing scores early on - as the Bills equalled an NFL record with eight straight games scoring 30 points or more.They are also just the second team to score and concede 40 points in back-to-back games.If this fixture is repeated in the Super Bowl it would be some spectacle, but both sides need to solve some defensive issues if they are to make it to New Orleans in February. The 11-3 Bills are the only team to beat the 13-1 Chiefs and will now fancy pipping them to the AFC top seed after the champions saw Mahomes limp out late in their 21-7 victory at the Cleveland Browns.The Chiefs have won 10 games this season by one score - six of those coming on the final play of the game - so this was their most comfortable victory of the campaign.""I feel like I could have finished the game in different circumstances,"" Mahomes said after the Chiefs opted to send back-up Carson Wentz in to finish the game.Head coach Andy Reid confirmed Mahomes' ankle was not broken, but the timing is tough with the Chiefs playing on Saturday, 21 December against Houston and then in a Christmas Day visit to Pittsburgh.With home advantage and a crucial bye week at stake in their race with the Bills, there will be a lot riding on further medical tests on Mahomes' ankle on Monday. The Pittsburgh Steelers have now lost 11 straight games in Philadelphia as the Eagles won the latest battle for Pennsylvania 27-13 - and a team record 10th straight victory of the season.Jalen Hurts finally got the Eagles' passing attack moving a week after receivers AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith's public criticism, with opposition quarterback Russell Wilson having all the production problems this week.The Steelers did secure a play-off place despite the defeat, but their top spot in the AFC North is under threat after the Baltimore Ravens dominated the New York Giants 35-14 to close the gap.Lamar Jackson threw five touchdown passes before next week's huge showdown against the Steelers in Baltimore - with Pittsburgh also sweating over defensive star TJ Watt who injured his ankle against the Eagles.The Houston Texans won a second straight AFC South title after beating the Dolphins 20-12 - in a game overshadowed by a serious injury to Miami receiver Grant DuBose, who was driven off on a stretcher in a neck brace after 10 minutes of treatment following a blow to the head.Head coach Mike McDaniel said DuBose would remain in hospital overnight after ""some positive feedback"" on his head and neck injuries. Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers impressed with a comprehensive 30-13 win in Seattle, which saw the Seahawks lose top spot in the NFC West and drop out of the play-off places altogether.At 10-4, only five teams in the entire NFL have a better record than the Packers, but two of those are in Green Bay's division - so a wildcard looks their most likely route to the play-offs.The Packers helped one of their rivals out, with the Minnesota Vikings bagging a play-off spot before their Monday night game thanks to Seattle losing.The divisional system is helping out the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who improved to just 8-6 with a 40-17 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers and that is good enough to top the weaker NFC South. The Washington Commanders led 20-7 in the fourth quarter but had to survive a late onslaught at the New Orleans Saints, with back-up quarterback Spencer Rattler throwing a touchdown pass as time expired.Trailing by a point, interim head coach Darren Rizzi went for a two-point conversion and instant win instead of settling for overtime, but the try just failed, allowing Washington to escape 20-19.Indianapolis Colts running back Jonathan Taylor was left red faced when he casually dropped the ball after scoring a touchdown - only for a video replay to spot he did so just inches before the line.That cost the Colts dearly as they went on to lose 31-13 at the Denver Broncos.Joe Burrow threw another three touchdown passes as the Cincinnati Bengals beat the Tennessee Titans 37-27 in a game filled with mistakes.The two teams combined for 10 turnovers and 26 penalties in a coach's nightmare of a game.Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams rolled back the years as the New York Jets beat the slumping Jacksonville Jaguars 32-25 - with Adams becoming the 12th player with 100 receiving touchdowns in NFL history.The Jets are already out of play-off contention but Rodgers and Adams gave a glimpse of what they could possibly do next season if both stay with the team.Micah Parsons inspired the Dallas Cowboys to a comfortable win at the Carolina Panthers and the Arizona Cardinals ended a three-game losing run by beating the New England Patriots.

England take control of Test after South Africa collapse,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cvg68jl0rd4o,"South Africa v England, one-off Test (day two of four)England 395-9 dec & 31-1 (14 overs):Knight 19; Hlubi 1-1South Africa 281 (88.4 overs):Wolvaardt 65; Bell 4-49England lead by 145 runsScorecard England took control of the one-off Test against South Africa as the hosts lost their last seven first-innings wickets for 44 runs in a dramatic evening session.The Proteas' top order battled to reach 237-3 in Bloemfontein, before a delay for lightning after tea coincided with a change of course in the game.England's seamers pounced with the new ball under darkening skies to dismiss South Africa for 281 and take a 114-run lead.That advantage was extended to 145 as Tammy Beaumont and Heather Knight steered England to 31-1 at the close, after first-innings centurion Maia Bouchier fell for a duck.South Africa earlier appeared on course to reach parity through Marizanne Kapp, who made a fluent 57 before she was bowled by debutant Ryana MacDonald-Gay which sparked the collapse as the delay came just five balls later.MacDonald-Gay struck again shortly after the resumption with Nadine de Klerk caught behind for a duck, Lauren Filer ended Sune Luus' resistance for a gritty 56 and Chloe Tryon tamely chipped Lauren Bell to mid-on for 20.Bell finished with 4-49 after mopping up the tail, with the collapse distracting from the disciplined efforts of South Africa's top order throughout the morning and afternoon sessions.Opener Anneke Bosch fell in the second over of the day, but a stand of 92 between Laura Wolvaardt and Annerie Dercksen helped the hosts rebuild until the latter was caught at slip off Filer from the final ball before lunch.The omission of the decision review system (DRS) for the match had a huge impact on the home side as captain Wolvaardt was visibly frustrated to be given out lbw to Sophie Ecclestone for 65, suggesting she had hit the ball.A chanceless partnership of 99 between Kapp and Luus followed but, once broken, a fragile middle to lower order was exposed and gave England hope of a first Test win since 2014. There was some concern that Kate Cross' omission from England's XI because of a back spasm could leave the seam attack short of control, but Bell and Filer stepped up with impressive maturity despite South Africa's gutsy partnerships for the second and fourth wickets.At times, Filer sacrificed accuracy as a result of her raw pace, but that point of difference proved invaluable on a docile pitch.The impressive Dercksen withstood the pressure after England's early breakthrough and dug in alongside her captain, and though both batters were tested by Filer's short ball in her fiery opening spell, they were mostly untroubled.But Knight threw Filer the ball for a short burst before lunch and it produced the desired result, with Dercksen fending off a short ball to slip where Ecclestone took a cracking one-handed rebound catch.While Luus and Kapp's partnership after lunch was solid, South Africa are not blessed with the same batting depth as England and it always felt as if one wicket would change the direction of the Test.MacDonald-Gay took out Kapp's off stump with a beauty as reward for her disciplined spell and then the lower order was blown away by Bell, with the tail backing away as England moved into the ascendancy. While the seamers played starring roles, wicketkeeper Amy Jones and left-arm spinner Ecclestone also proved crucial. They ensured that South Africa's top order, despite batting well, were unable to be ruthless in the manner of Bouchier and Nat Sciver-Brunt for England on day one.Ecclestone may have got a touch fortunate with the wicket of Wolvaardt if she did get an edge, but that moment followed a spell of remarkable consistency that gave the batter so few options to score and put the pressure back on.Wolvaardt seemed happy to defend Ecclestone and score from the other end, but she could only defy the spinner's greatness for so long, getting stuck on the crease by one defensive prod too many.The result was a furious Wolvaardt thumping her helmet with her bat as she marched off in disbelief, and while that was Ecclestone's only scalp, she twirled away for 25 overs and conceded just 40, which allowed captain Knight to rotate her seamers regularly and ensure they were all well rested between spells.Meanwhile, Jones' ability to stand up to the medium-pacers set up the prized wicket of Kapp, who also found herself stuck in the crease and unable to manipulate the ball as effectively as she had against Bell and Filer.Kapp became frustrated and lost her off stump, while De Klerk also fell victim to the same trap as she got an edge through to Jones for a sharp catch.Luus had previously dropped anchor as Kapp was more aggressive, but following the wickets she looked uncertain about whether to continue with the approach or try to increase her strike rate when batting with the tail, eventually falling to the new ball by edging Filer behind after a 148-ball stay.The pitch is showing signs of deteriorating and Beaumont and Knight had to negotiate some uneven bounce at the end of the day.England's healthy lead puts them in a commanding position, though a forecast for wet weather on day four could force them to move the game along at a quicker rate."

PGA Tour v LIV - why 'The Showdown' is significant,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c1el0y158g8o,"A supposed peace deadline had just passed and men's professional golf was mired in more uncertainty, when the idea to create a match between PGA Tour players and those from the breakaway LIV circuit was first pitched.The initial approach, by TV producer Bryan Zuriff, was made to the Rory McIlroy camp in Dubai last January. Zuriff was responsible for previous iterations of 'The Match' - televised silly season clashes for cash.But this concept seemed to carry more significance. McIlroy certainly saw it that way as did three of his most notable peers, which is why 'The Showdown' comes to fruition in Las Vegas on Tuesday.McIlroy partners world number one Scottie Scheffler against LIV recruits Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka in an 18-hole Ryder Cup-style matchplay event. For once, this is a confected contest tasty enough to be worth watching. PGA versus LIV - the establishment against the upstarts and McIlroy against DeChambeau - the man who capitalised on the Northern Irish star's US Open capitulation last June.Scheffler competes fresh from reminding us of his prowess with victory in the Bahamas last week, while DeChambeau and 2023 US PGA Championship winner Koepka are past sworn enemies now united as the only players to land majors while playing under the LIV umbrella.These are attractive storylines and this is the first time since The Open in high summer that this quartet of superstars have all been able to play in the same event.If you wanted to put on a match, these are the four players you would want, which is telling, because professional golf remains a fractured, split sport. But this week's competition is the vehicle to demonstrate that some of the biggest names have had enough of an increasingly tedious and debilitating divide.Last week McIlroy was asked whether this event would serve as a detrimental reminder that men's professional golf is still a sport at war. The world number three thought it was ""a terrible question"", but it did yield an interesting response.""We're trying to bring these players together, and the more opportunities we can get to do that, the better,"" McIlroy said.""Does it remind people we're not playing together all the time? Yes. But at least we're making the effort to try to bring the best together more often. If we can start by doing something like this, that's only a good thing.""He is saying, in other words, that the stars are taking this into their own hands to make an influential push to end the stalemate. This is another example of how the power of leading players has increased while rival factions have been battling for the game's future.Scheffler weighed in by saying: ""There's been so much talk about LIV versus the PGA Tour, all this talk about money. We want to get back to the competition. It's fun to get together to compete.""It is fair to say the PGA Tour was lukewarm about two of its most prominent members' involvement in competing against a pair of LIV stars, who remain suspended from the tour for joining the Saudi Arabia funded league.Significantly this match occurs in a week when there is no conflicting PGA Tour tournament. ""It took a few conversations to get them to the point where they saw that this could be a good thing in the long run,"" McIlroy admitted.""It wasn't all plain sailing, but we got there in the end.""PGA Tour boss Jay Monahan and his board continue negotiations with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) over a reported acquisition of six percent of the tour's commercial arm by the PIF.This is the deal that is now almost a year past its initial deadline, but it could still herald peace in golf's so called 'civil war'.If Saudi Arabia becomes formally invested in both sides, LIV and PGA Tour players being reunited at tournaments beyond the majors is a more likely scenario.But until a contract is signed and receives US government approval, we have only a handful of DP World Tour events where LIV recruits have been welcomed and this week's 'Showdown' at Shadow Creek as opportunities to see together golfers from the conflicted constituencies.The players will be mic'd up, but the golf should do the talking because there are enough ingredients to give the contest a degree of edge which has been missing from previous iterations.Genuine interaction between the players will be fascinating to hear. We do not need faux banter that can so often infect this kind of occasion and hopefully the players will remember they are golfers rather than comedians.It is no joke to say that this is possibly a glance into the future and not just because the spoils are coming in the form of Crypto currency. The LIV camp is already talking up an enticing prospect of a Ryder Cup style match between the rival tours.It is a concept that could excite fans and maybe replace the moribund Presidents Cup put on in non-Ryder years by the PGA Tour, which is contested by teams representing the US and non-European internationals and is not open to LIV golfers.Such developments in pro golf do not tend to happen in a hurry, though. Nevertheless, the fact that this week's contest is occurring at all is a start.And through its relative competitive validity it is, maybe, a significant step towards some kind of reconciliation."
"Amazon aware of warehouse injury risk, report findsThe e-commerce giant is accused of trying to misrepresent its safety record, but says a report ""isn't grounded in reality"".1 hr agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyjm507462o,"Amazon pushes its US warehouse workers to fulfill orders at speeds that could cause high rates of injury despite being aware of the risks, an investigation led by Senator Bernie Sanders has found.Thefindings, following an 18-month probe of the firm, support claims that workers and labour campaigners have made about the company for years.The report accused the firm of rejecting changes that would have reduced workers' pace, but improved safety because of concerns about its bottom line.But Amazonsaidthe report was ""wrong on the facts"", and featured ""selective, outdated information that lacks context and isn't grounded in reality"". ""This investigation wasn't a fact-finding mission, but rather an attempt to collect information and twist it to support a false narrative,"" the company said.Amazon, which employs roughly 800,000 people in the US, has faced accusations about unsafe conditions at its warehouses for years.Those concerns ramped up during the Covid pandemic, when e-commerce exploded, leading to protests by its workers around the world.Amid the controversy, founder Jeff Bezos said the company needed to do better by its employees.Senator Sanders, who is known for his pro-worker stance,launched an investigation into Amazon's practices in June 2023.Senate staffers conducted 135 interviews and reviewed more than 1,000 documents.Their analysis of public records found that warehouses operated by Amazon recorded over 30% more injuries than the warehousing industry average in 2023.Amazon workers were also nearly twice as likely to be injured than people working in warehouses operated by other companies in each of the last seven years, according to the report, which was signed off by Democratic members of the Senate's Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Amazon had internally examined connections between workplace speed and injury rates, including in a review called Project Soteria, according to the investigation.But the report said the company opted not to adopt the recommended changes, which included providing more time off to workers, and halting disciplinary action against people who did not meet working speed requirements.Investigators also accused Amazon of trying to ""manipulate"" data to mislead the public about its safety record.Amazon said it was fair for the firm to focus safety comparisons on larger warehouses.It accused the Senate investigation of ignoring inconvenient facts, such as a decline in its injury rates and a recent court victory, which dismissed safety complaints.It said another team asked to review the recommendations of Amazon's internal safety study had found that the methodology was ""unsound"".""Nothing"" is more important to the firm than employee safety, Amazon said.""Sen. Sanders and his staff chose to rely on the debunked Soteria analysis because it fits the false narrative he wanted to build,"" the company added."
"Bitcoin hits new record high of more than $106,000The world's largest cryptocurrency has risen by more than 50% since Donald Trump's election victory.8 hrs agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ywp0l0xrxo,"Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, extending a rally that has seen the cryptocurrency's price rise by more than 50% since Donald Trump's victory in the 5 November election.The world's largest cryptocurrency briefly passed $106,000 (£83,890), before falling back to around $105,000 in Asia trade on Monday.The incoming Trump administration is seen as being far more friendly towards cryptocurrencies than the Biden White House.On Thursday, the US president-elect reiterated that he is considering creating a national stockpile of the digital currency, similar to the country's strategic oil reserve. ""The Bitcoin rally since the election has been parabolic and the FOMO - or fear of missing out - rally is gathering momentum,"" Peter McGuire from trading platform XM.com told the BBC.""Many investors believe $120,000 is achievable by the end of the year and then in 2025 there's talk of greater than $150,000 by mid-year"".Earlier this month, Trump named Silicon Valley entrepreneur David Sacks as his artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency tsar.Mr Sacks is a former PayPal executive and a close friend of Trump adviser and mega-donor Elon Musk. Trump has also said he would nominate pro-cryptocurrency Washington attorney Paul Atkins as the new head of the Wall Street regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Last month,the SEC's current head, Gary Gensler, said he would resign from the roleon the day of Trump's inauguration, on 20 January next year.""I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility. The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favour,"" Mr Gensler wrote on the social media platform X.Trump had previously revealed plans to sack Mr Gensler on ""day one"" of his new administration after the SEC chairman took legal action against cryptocurrency firms, sparking controversy in some quarters."
"Trump gets $15m in ABC News defamation caseThe network also publishes a statement expressing ""regret"" for statements by George Stephanopoulos.1 day agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrw57q4y9do,"ABC News has agreed to pay $15m (£12m) to US President-elect Donald Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit after its star anchor falsely said he had been found ""liable for rape"".George Stephanopoulos made the statements repeatedly during an interview on 10 March this year while challenging a congresswoman about her support for Trump.A jury in a civil caselast year determinedTrump was liable for ""sexual abuse"", which has a specific definition under New York law.As part of Saturday's settlement, first reported by Fox News Digital, ABC alsopublished an editor's noteexpressing its ""regret"" for the statements by Stephanopoulos. According to the settlement, ABC News will pay $15m as a charitable contribution to a ""Presidential foundation and museum to be established by or for Plaintiff, as Presidents of the United States of America have established in the past"".The $15m will go towards Trump's future presidential library, US media reported.The network also agreed to pay $1m towards Trump's legal fees.Under the settlement, the network will post an editor's note to the bottom of its 10 March 2024 online news article about the story.It will say: ""ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC's This Week on March 10, 2024.""An ABC News spokesperson said in a statement the company was ""pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing"".In 2023, a New York civil court found Trump sexually abused E Jean Carroll in a dressing room at a department store in 1996. He was also found guilty of defaming the magazine columnist.Judge Lewis Kaplan said the jury's conclusion was that Ms Carroll had failed to prove that Trump raped her ""within the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law"".Judge Kaplan noted that the definition of rape was ""far narrower"" than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries and in criminal statutes elsewhere.In a separate case, also presided over by the same judge, a jury ordered Trump to pay $83.3m to Ms Carroll for additional defamatory statements.Trump is appealing against both verdicts. During the 10 March broadcast, Stephanopoulos asked South Carolina Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace how she could endorse Trump.The anchor falsely said ""judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape"".Stephanopoulos repeated the claim 10 times throughout the broadcast.Ahead of the ruling, a federal magistrate judge had ordered Trump and Stephanopoulos to give sworn evidence at depositions next week.Trump has also sued CBS, the BBC's US broadcast partner, for ""deceptive conduct"" over an interview with Kamala Harris.In 2023,a judge threw out his defamation lawsuitagainst CNN, in which he alleged the network had likened him to Adolf Hitler.He has also had lawsuits filed against the New York Times and the Washington Post dismissed."
Founder of fashion chain Mango dies in cave accidentThe 71-year-old is remembered for his fashion leadership after the accident in caves near Barcelona.2 days agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wed2egp4vo,"Isak Andic, the billionaire founder of high street fashion chain Mango, died in an accident on Saturday while exploring caves near Barcelona.Spanish media reported the 71-year-old fell down a ravine to his death while hiking in caves that are part of a mountain range.Andic was with his son and other family members when he fell, according to the El Pais newspaper, triggering a large emergency response.The Turkish-born businessman founded Mangowith the help of his brother, Nahman,in Barcelona in 1984 and the chain now operates almost 3,000 outlets in 120 countries. Forbes estimated Andic's net worth to be $4.5bn (£3.6bn). Andic reportedly fell down a 150-metre ravine while hiking in an area of the Montserrat mountains known for its deep caves.Police were called at around 13:00 local time (12:00 GMT), and a helicopter and specialised mountain unit was sent to the scene, El Pais reported.Mango CEO Toni Ruiz said in a statement: ""His departure leaves a huge void but all of us are, in some way, his legacy and the testimony of his achievements.""It is up to us, and this is the best tribute we can make to Isak and which we will fulfil, to ensure that Mango continues to be the project that Isak aspired to and of which he would feel proud.""Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez confirmed Andic died in an accident at the Salnitre de Collbató caves.""All my love and recognition for your great work and business vision, which has turned this Spanish firm into a world leader in fashion,"" Sanchez said. The president of Catalonia's government, Salvador Illa Roca, said he was ""dismayed by the loss"" and described Andic as a ""committed businessman"" who ""contributed to making Catalonia great and projecting it to the world"".Andic moved to north-eastern Spain's Catalonia region in the 1960s with his family and was a non-executive chairman of the company when he died. Mango had a turnover of €3.1bn (£2.6bn) in 2023.He was seen as having a rivalry with Zara founder Amancio Ortega, another Spanish fashion billionaire.The brand's popularity in the UK was boosted in 2011 when British model Kate Moss was announced as the face of Mango."
"In from the cold: Scandi wines hope to win over drinkersThanks to climate change and tougher vines, Denmark and Sweden have a growing number of wineries.19 hrs agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27w5q315ro,"Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, andeven Norway,as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.""People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,"" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrhøj Vingård.Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and rosé.""We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,"" she explains. For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrhøj Vingård. ""There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,"" he chuckles. ""People like it.""The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. ""We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,"" says Mr Fink. Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.Curiosity, and the fact ""it's possible"", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.""I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,"" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.""I began with 500 vines,"" said Jean Becker, ""Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.""But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain. In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.""It is very challenging because it's new for us,"" he says. ""We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.""Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almosttwo degrees celsiusover the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and alonger fruit-growing season.But there remains a risk of frost damage.Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. ""We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.""But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. ""Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere."" However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. ""Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.""He is leading a programme called ""FastGrapes"", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.""There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,"" says the researcher. ""Part of that search happens in the lab… you can see the genes that make it strong.""The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium. But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bjäre peninsula. ""We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],"" he says.But ''starting from scratch"" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. ""It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.""Thora's owner, American expat Heather Öberg says all the effort and expense is worth it. ""We can compete with other European wines,"" she says.Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; £22) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.""We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,"" says Mr Becker. At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.""If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,"" he jokes.However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. ""The Danish wine is still too expensive,"" he says. ""It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.""

Christmas dinner in the UK set to cost less this yearThe BBC digs into which bits of the festive feast have gone up and down in price.7 hrs agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv3y61qq41o,"Falling turkey and Brussels sprout prices mean Christmas dinner will cost a little less at the supermarket checkout this year.The price of Brussels sprouts has fallen by 12%, while a 10lb (4.55kg) frozen turkey will cost you £1.21 less than it did last year, research for the BBC suggests.But digging deeper we discovered root vegetables have gone up in price this year, after wet weather delayed the planting season.When all the trimmings are totted up, a family Christmas is set to cost £31.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of £32.18. It reflects food prices rising at a slower rate in the past year, as UK inflation has eased. The annual change in price for products across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl were measured by Retail tracking platform Assosia.The crown of the Christmas feast, the turkey, has fallen in price by 6% this year, according to this data.Tom Copas, managing director of Copas Turkeys in Cookham, Berkshire, said the price of turkeys had begun to stabilise after a couple of ""incredibly turbulent"" years that had pushed up the cost of rearing his birds.""Hence we're seeing incremental changes in prices year on year, rather than dramatic ones,"" added Mr Copas, whose family has been rearing turkeys since 1957.However, Mr Copas says he'd seen slower sales and more demand for smaller turkeys this year, perhaps indicating customers were tightening their belts.""It's possibly people are trying to keep the overall basket spend down."" Brussels sprouts came in at 12p cheaper for a 500g bag compared to last year.Hot summers and sudden cold snaps of the previous two years had made things hard for producers, says John Inglis, senior commercial manager at ESG Drysdale, one of the UK's largest sprout producers.But he says this year has seen us get ""back to normality"" after ""a couple of tricky seasons"" and sprouts are thriving again.The price change may not affect everyone though as the humble sprout can be a divisive veg. A YouGov poll earlier this year found that a quarter of Britons dislike them, with the controversial brassica more popular with older generations. Root vegetables were behind the largest price changes in our Christmas shop.Maris Piper potatoes have seen a whopping 26% increase, with a typical 2kg bag up from £1.58 to £1.99.Tracy Bush, co-director of Provenance Potatoes in Kent, says poor weather has had a lot to do with the price of spuds going up in recent years.""We've had a particularly wet spring so planting was difficult for any root crops, and then the autumn when crops are lifted and harvested, that was also very difficult,"" she says. Carrot farmer Rodger Hobson says the same wet weather delayed this year's carrot planting season. Last year, the weather was so bad that supermarkets had to import carrots. This year,they've gone up by 13.4% to 69p per kilo.But Mr Hobson says he would not be surprised if ""when it comes to Christmas week they'll be down to 20p a kilo"".This is because carrots are often chosen as ""loss leaders"" in supermarkets. They're sold at a loss to attract customers in to spend on more profitable items.Ged Futter is a retail specialist who used to be a buyer for Asda. He says supermarkets drastically reduce their prices in the week before Christmas.""Every year they do the same thing,"" he says, noting that supermarkets usually fight for customers with cut price ""potatoes, carrots, parsnips, Brussels spouts"".Mr Hobson says perishable items make for good loss leaders because customers can't stockpile them when they are cheap. If supermarkets reduced the price of long-life items like baked beans, shoppers might be tempted to buy their year's supply in December, he says.While loss-leaders are good for shoppers, Mr Futter stressed these below-cost prices ""don't show the true cost to the farmer"" and can generate a lot of food waste.""People think that food is cheap to produce - that's not true."" This year price rises were not confined to the main meal - the cost of Christmas desserts also went up.Christmas pudding is 11% more expensive than in 2023, and mince pies are up by 5%, according to Assosia's research.Jessica White, the owner of Meg Rivers artisan bakery, says: ""Our costs have indeed gone up of ingredients, packaging, wages and like everyone - electricity."" But she says her company had chosen not to put prices up this year.They have already sold out of Christmas puddings and have had to make more to fulfil the waiting list, she says. ""We make more and more each year and don't notice a drop in demand."" BBC News also looked into how the cost of a Christmas dinner might vary depending on where you shop.We compared prices on the websites of the UK's top five supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Aldi.Our snapshot from one day, which does not take into account loyalty card prices, suggests Aldi was the cheapest supermarket for a basic list of Christmas essentials, at around £24.30.Asda was second cheapest at £28.22, followed by Morrisons and Sainsbury's.Tesco was most expensive at £36.51. Last year,our research suggestedMorrisons was the most expensive, with Tesco third. While we tried to find equivalent items across all five supermarkets, there are some small differences in product sizes or types. So the cost of your Christmas dinner might vary between supermarkets and the items you choose.Prices will also vary the closer we get to Christmas as supermarket competition becomes even more fierce.Our BBC analysis should not be directly compared with the price rise figures from retail analysis firm Assosia as we both use a slightly different basket. Start with a budget: Plan ahead and add up hidden expenses, like tin foil for roasting a turkey.Write a food list: Decide on your must haves and what you might not miss.Bargain hunt: Look out for online offers as well as yellow sticker items which have been reduced.Use your freezer: Christmas foods that freeze well include butter, meat joints and some cheeses like cheddar.Join up with friends and family: This means you can buy bigger pack sizes, which are often better value.Read more from the BBC Food team here"

Earlier this year, Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he would honour the service - in whatever form it takes -""for as long as I am alive"".The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business ""a fighting chance"".The regulator said in Septemberthat it was looking at these changes, with a decision due next year.Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were ""real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future"".Given letter numbers are falling ""we have to think about what is economical"", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year ""to make sure it is sustainable"". The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year. When debts are included, the deal values the company at £5.3bn.Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said while it was up to shareholders to approve the deal, the agreement the government had reached meant the takeover ""will be a good deal for the UK, be a good deal for the people who work for Royal Mail and a good deal for customers"".Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had ""resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings.He added, that EP Group had a ""mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers"". The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.It has also reached an agreement in principle with unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run.Dave Ward, the general secretary of the CWU union, told the BBC it was an ""extensive agreement"" and the deal was the ""best opportunity"" to save the future of Royal Mail.However, he added that the union had ""not agreed anything"" on USO reform and there was ""a long way to go"" before that happened. IDS also owns a highly profitable European parcels business called GLS which made over £300m last year. This offset lossesat Royal Mail, allowing IDS to report a small profit.By bringing GLS parcel know-how to the UK market, coupled with investment in out-of-home delivery lockers, Mr Kretinsky hopes to build a pan-European logistics business.The hope is that this will enable Royal Mail to claw back market share it has lost in recent years in the profitable and growing parcels business.Mr Kretinsky has a net worth of £6bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury's, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU.Earlier this year the takeover was called in for review under national security laws as Royal Mail is considered vital national infrastructure.But speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a ""legitimate business figure""whose alleged links to Russiahad already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago. Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses.The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels.Last week,Royal Mail was fined £10.5mby the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.Ofcom's Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would ""absolutely"" hold Royal Mail to account.Jenny Hall, director of corporate affairs at Royal Mail, told the BBC the company was investing to improve performance, but it was ""really important"" the USO was reformed to reflect consumer trends.She added that Royal Mail would always try to keep postage costs as low as possible, but prices do ""need to reflect the realities of delivering the service"".The price of a second-class stamp, which is currently 85p, is regulated by Ofcom, with the amount Royal Mail can increase it by each year tied to inflation.However, there are no such limits on first-class stamps, and in October Royal Mailpushed the price for first-class mailup by 30p to £1.65, citing ""very real and urgent"" financial challenges for the move.

"West African bloc pins hopes on ambitious superhighway from Ivory Coast to NigeriaThe road could breathe new life into West Africa's regional bloc, Ecowas.1 day agoAfrica",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr56dq0gr2mo,"West African leaders are holding a crucial summit in Nigeria's capital Abuja, focusing on the morale-sapping departure of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger from their 15-member bloc Ecowas.Few think the military rulers of the three dissident states can be persuaded to pause or reverse their decision.While faced with this blow to regional unity, West Africa is also poised to start work on a 1,028km (689 miles) highway from Ivory Coast's main city Abidjan - through Ghana, Togo and Benin - to Nigeria's biggest city Lagos.Construction is supposed to start in 2026 and pledges of $15.6bn (£12.3bn) have already been mobilised from a range of funders and investors.Just as Western Europe matched the Soviet-led communist bloc with a ""Common Market"" that later evolved into today's trading powerhouse, the  European Union (EU), so Ecowas may find that a drive for prosperity and growth proves to be its most effective response to the wave of military coups and nationalism that have swept across the region since 2020.The plan to build a modern transport corridor along the West African coast was originally approved eight years ago - long before the coups that have overturned civilian rule in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.Preparatory studies, led by the African Development Bank, were commissioned.But when these were presented last month, the timing could hardly have come at a better moment for reinvigorating the battered self-confidence of Ecowas (Economic Community of West African States).Neither traditional diplomacy, nor sanctions, nor even the threat of military intervention in Niger, had managed to push the juntas into organising elections and restoring civilian government, as required by Ecowas governance rules.The defiant regimes declared they would leave the 15-member bloc altogether.They have subsequently spurned the remaining members' efforts to persuade them to stay, although the Ecowas envoy, Senegal's new, young President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who shares their nationalistic outlook, is still trying.Until this crisis, Ecowas was Africa's most cohesive and politically integrated regional grouping, with a creditable record of crisis management and even the deployment of peacekeepers in troubled member states.With the departure of Mali, Burkina and Niger, the bloc will lose 76 million of its 446 million people and more than half its total geographical land area, with the loss of vast tracts of the Sahara – a painful blow to prestige and self-belief. The shock of the three countries' withdrawal may boost those pushing for tougher governance and democracy rules.Meanwhile, the ambitious coastal transport corridor project, conceived to support economic development, will also serve a political purpose - demonstrating the remaining member countries' capacity to work together and accelerating the trade growth and investment attraction of coastal urban West Africa, already the most prosperous part of this vast region.And just as the EU's wealth and dynamism proved a powerful attraction for former communist states, perhaps rising prosperity across Ecowas will eventually entice the now disenchanted further north states into rejoining the bloc.Construction of the proposed four-to-six lane motorway is forecast to create 70,000 jobs, with completion ambitiously targeted for 2030.And the plan is to acquire a sufficiently broad strip of land along the route to later accommodate a new railway line, linking the big port cities along the Gulf of Guinea. Existing rail routes extend inland, but there is no rail line along the coast.The road will connect many of West Africa's largest cities - Abidjan, with 8.3 million people, Accra (4 million), Lomé (2 million), Cotonou (2.6 million) and Lagos, estimated at close to 20 million or perhaps even more.Several of the cities are key gateway ports for the flow of trade in and out of the region.Already the bureaucratic hassles and risks of petty corruption that have so often complicated life for drivers passing from one country to the next are beginning to wane.At many border crossings, modern one-stop frontier posts, where officials from both countries work side by side to check passports and transit documents, have replaced the assorted huts where drivers and passengers queued at a succession of counters while one set of border police and customs officers after another laboriously worked their way through the formalities.And now the proposed highway and rail line promise to further speed the flow of trade and travel between the coastal economies, boosting competitiveness and integration and transforming the region's attraction for investors - just as the EU transformed trade and development across the European continent.And that process of economic and administrative integration of course had enormous political consequences.It acted as a powerful incentive for countries still outside the bloc to improve economic governance, strengthen democracy and tackle corruption, in the hope of qualifying for membership.Perhaps Ecowas can emulate this precedent, and lure the dissident states into re-joining, particularly if flagship projects such as the transport corridor give a real fillip to growth.For not only do Mali, Niger and Burkina face severe development and security challenges, but they are also all landlocked, and heavily dependent on their coastal neighbours, through transport, trade and labour migration. Huge volumes of trade, formal and informal, flow across the borders.Livestock from the three countries in the Sahel is exported on the hoof to feed city dwellers in Dakar, Abidjan and Lagos.Onions and potatoes grown in Niger's arid climate are prized by coastal household shoppers, while Ivorian, Ghanaian and Nigerian manufactured goods are exported in the opposite direction.Millions of Burkinabès and Malians are settled in Ivory Coast, a mainstay of the workforce for its cocoa plantations.Moreover, the coup leaders are not pulling out of the West African CFA franc, an eight-country single currency, backed by France, that hampers competitiveness but provides a solid defence against inflation and monetary instability.Yet these deep ties between the Sahelian countries and coastal West Africa were not sufficient to deter the military regimes in Mali, Burkina and Niger from announcing their withdrawal from Ecowas.Hostility to the bloc, which they portray as bullying and arrogant, has paid political dividends, boosting their popularity at home. And Morocco talks of opening up an alternative trade corridor to its Atlantic ports, which could broaden the options.But if the remaining Ecowas countries can accelerate their own drive for prosperity, pruning back trade barriers and pressing forward with breakthrough projects such as the coastal highway and rail line, then gradually they may salve today's political bruises and mistrusts and draw the Sahel states back into a reunified West African regional identity.Paul Melly is a consulting fellow with the Africa Programme at Chatham House in London.

"Trump rings bell on record stock market - but will it last?The US president-elect comes into office with a strong economy, but investors hope for more and current highs may be difficult to sustain.4 days agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn8yjw11go,"Donald Trump stood on Wall Street on Thursday, a euphoric crowd of America's business elite assembled before him, and hammered the bell to kick off morning stock market trading.The mood was celebratory. Not only had the president-elect just beennamed Time person of the year, but the stock market, already up strongly, has surged to new heights since his election.For Trump, whose public appearances have been relatively sparing since his election win last month, the visit was a reminder of the high value he places on market opinion.But whether history will look back on his appearance as the well-timed heralding of another economic boom - or a death knell - remains to be seen. Trump is entering office with a US economy that is, in the recent words of America's central bank boss, Jerome Powell, the envy of many other countries, with solid growth of 2.8%, unemployment near historic lows of 4.2% and that mysterious ingredient known as ""productivity"" on a tear.It has combined to push American stocks to record levels: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to end the year up more than 17%.The S&P 500, a bigger index made up of America's 500 largest companies, has surged 28% since January, while the Nasdaq, where tech firms have a major presence, has rallied more than 40%.Investors are hoping for more, with the Trump administration expected to loosen regulations and green-light takeovers that might have come under harsh review during President Joe Biden's administration.At the stock exchange on Thursday,  a who's who of the business world, including Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon and Target chief Brian Cornell, had assembled. The president-elect was greeted with sustained applause and whistles, which later gave way to chants of ""USA! USA!""His visit marked a relatively rare appearance by a sitting or former president. But analysts have warned that current highs may be difficult to sustain in the year ahead.Job creation is already slowing and price inflation is proving stubborn.Many of Trump's priorities - including slashing government spending, erecting stiff, broad-based trade barriers and embarking on mass deportations of migrants - if enacted, could pose further challenges to growth.Though debate is ongoing about how much the president actually will do, the proposals are generating uncertainty and have the potential for significant disruption, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.""The totality of the policies, if implemented to the degree that the president has articulated, I think will be problematic for the economy,"" he said. At the stock exchange on Thursday, Trump kept his comments focused on other parts of his agenda more palatable to markets: his promises to lower taxes from 21% to 15% for businesses manufacturing in America, cut regulation and speed up government approvals.""A nuclear power plant - I would say a week would be enough time. What do you think?"" he said, to laughter.Similar policies, which Zandi said would be good for the corporate bottom line, if not necessarily the economy, boosted share prices significantly during Trump's first term.He cited those gains repeatedly as a sign of his administration's success, especially at the start.But the market retreated during trade wars with allies and with China - then nose-dived at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, before rapidly recovering.Ultimately, the S&P 500 gained more than 67% on his watch - a record bested by presidents Bill Clinton in the 1990s and Barack Obama during his first four years.Under Biden, the index has risen 59% so far. Whether Trump can repeat that performance is something he has declined to predict.The main US stock indexes closed lower on Thursday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq dipping by around 0.5%.Asked at the stock exchange what investors should be buying in anticipation of the future, Trump, somewhat uncharacteristically, demurred.""I don't want to get into a situation where they do and we have a dip or something"", he said, then added, ""Long term, this is going to be a country like no other."""
OpenAI whistleblower found dead in San Francisco apartmentThe San Francisco medical examiner's office determined Suchir Balaji's death to be suicide and police found no evidence of foul play.2 days agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0el3r2nlko,"An OpenAI researcher-turned-whistleblower has been found dead in an apartment in San Francisco, authorities said.The body of Suchir Balaji, 26, was discovered on 26 November after police said they received a call asking officers to check on his wellbeing.The San Francisco medical examiner's office determined his death to be suicide and police found no evidence of foul play.In recent months Mr Balaji had publicly spoken out against artificial intelligence company OpenAI's practices, which has been fighting a number of lawsuits relating to its data-gathering practices. In October,the New York Times published an interviewwith Mr Balaji in which he alleged that OpenAI had violated US copyright law while developing its popular ChatGPT online chatbot.The article said that after working at the company for four years as a researcher, Mr Balaji had come to the conclusion that ""OpenAI's use of copyrighted data to build ChatGPT violated the law and that technologies like ChatGPT were damaging the internet"".OpenAI says its models are ""trained on publicly available data"".Mr Balaji left the company in August, telling the New York Times he had since been working on personal projects.He grew up in Cupertino, California, before going to study computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.A spokesperson for OpenAI said in a statement cited by CNBC News that it was ""devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones during this difficult time"".US and Canadian news publishers, including the New York Times, and a group of best-selling writers, including John Grisham, have filed lawsuits claiming the company was illegally using news articles to train its software.OpenAI told the BBC in November its software is ""grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation"".If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line, , or contactSamaritans.If you're in the US, call 988, or contactLifeline."
"Tracing the powerful family roots of suspected killer Luigi MangioneIn his home city, the accused shooter's family name has meant wealth, power, prominence and philanthropy for decades.2 days agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl3jkjxp75o,"This week, the surname Mangione became associated with the killing of health-insurance executive Brian Thompson in New York City, when 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was charged with his murder.But for decades, the name has meant something entirely different: wealth, power, prominence, philanthropy - particularly within the Italian community of Baltimore.They're one of, if not the, ""most respected"" Italian families in the area, according to Giovanna Aquia Blatterman.Now 77, Ms Aquia Blatterman, who arrived in the US from Sicily in1953, said she has known three generations of Mangiones.The family is ""generous"" and ""self-made"", she said, while Luigi, who she met briefly about eight years ago, appeared clever, approachable and handsome – ""as you can tell"".""Something has occurred with him,"" she mused, referencing the last several days. ""He's two different people.""She also insisted he's innocent until proven guilty: ""This is one of the greatest honours of being an American citizen."" The cluster of streets in downtown Baltimore that make up Little Italy, where Ms Blatterman owns one of the neighbourhood's many Italian restaurants, has been an enclave for Italian immigrants since they flocked there in the 1800s and 1900s.An Italian tri-colour flag is still proudly displayed. Even fire hydrants are painted green, white and red.Nicholas Mangione Sr was born there in 1925, starting life in a poor immigrant family. He spent the first eight years of his life in a one-room flat with an outdoor privy toilet,according to the Baltimore Sun.During World War Two, he served in the Navy in the South Pacific before returning to his Maryland home where he built a series of enterprises as well as, according to local media, a combative - even aggressive – reputation when it came to his business interests.The dark fandom behind healthcare CEO murder suspectKilling of insurance CEO reveals simmering anger at US health system In a 1995 story about him titled 'Fiery builder has softer side', Mr Mangione recalled buying the Turf Valley resort, which lies to the west of Baltimore, in 1978.""People thought I needed money from the mafia to buy this place. They asked me what family I belonged to. I told them, 'I belong to the Mangione family. The Mangione family of Baltimore County.'""In 1988, Turf Valley was at the centre of a racism row when the then-manager - Mangione Sr's now deceased nephew - was recorded using a racial slur. The incident made local news.But within Baltimore's tight-knit Italian community, there's loyalty to Nick Mangione and his memory. Life-long Little Italy resident, 83-year-old Mary Ann Campanella, called him an ""excellent man"".""If you went to him (for help),"" she said, ""and he looked at you – you got it. He helped everyone.""The family patriarch - who long ago had moved his expanding family out to the suburbs - died in 2008, leaving behind 10 children, and 37 grandchildren, including Luigi Mangione. When he was arrested, police say Luigi Mangione was carrying a hand-written document detailing his alleged ""ill will"" towards corporate elites, which US media have reported included the line ""these parasites had it coming"".Unlike his grandfather, Luigi was born into privilege, attending an all-boys private school in a northern Baltimore suburb, where fees can reach $37,690 a year.From a rainy Baltimore roadside, the sprawling campus of the Gilman School is visible, including its centrepiece, a double-fronted, 1920s red-brick hall behind which are extensive sporting grounds.One family associate likened it to Eton, the English boys school attended by aristocratic familes and members of the Royal Family.Many have wondered how this 26-year-old man went from being a young, promising graduate to an alleged fugitive, arrested in a Pennsylvania McDonald's.Who is Luigi Mangione, CEO shooting suspect?Who was Brian Thompson, healthcare CEO gunned down in New York?How Luigi Mangione's legal defence could take shape The Mangiones boast a wealth of cousins, aunts and uncles, who have spread well beyond Little Italy. But the family has remained largely silent following Mr Mangione's arrest, only releasing a short statement via Republican state lawmaker and cousin Nino Mangione to say they are ""shocked and devastated"".Requests to talk to family members were met either with no response or a firm, but polite: ""No comment.""One simply told us: ""Everything that needs to be said has been.""Dylan Segelbaum, a reporter for local news website the Baltimore Banner, said that as Luigi Mangione grew up, his family owned businesses ranging from country clubs and golf courses to assisted living facilities.""The Mangione family is prominent in the Baltimore area,"" he said. The name is literally imprinted on Baltimore.A plaque at the entrance to the Family Center at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center reads: ""Donated by Nicholas and Mary Mangione.""""The family's very philanthropic,"" Mr Segelbaum said, noting the family gave more than $1m to the hospital.But Ms Blatterman insists the Mangiones have remained ""relatable"" and don't ""showboat"".Previously a salon stylist, Ms Blatterman said she cut the hair of Luigi Mangione's grandmother Mary Mangione, who she calls ""Miss Mary"", in the early 1970s.And, before the Covid pandemic, she said she played bocce (an Italian bowling game) with members of the Mangione family, including Luigi Mangione's parents, Louis and Kathleen Mangione.""Kathy has a travel agency. She does trips to Italy,"" she said.While she expressed sympathy for the family of Mr Thompson, 50, the health-executive fatally shot on 4 December, Ms Blatterman said her thoughts are also with the Mangiones.New York grand jury begins hearing Mangione case - report""I can't imagine what the family's going through.

"Canadian government moves to end weeks-long postal strikeAround 55,000 postal workers began striking on 15 November over pay and working conditions.3 days agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8g4yvjdqvo,"The Canadian government is moving to end a nearly month-long postal workers' strike that has disrupted mail delivery across the country ahead of the holidays.On Friday, Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon ordered the Canadian Industrial Relations Board to send Canada Post employees back to work if an agreement is not reached soon with their employer.Around 55,000 postal workers began striking on 15 November over pay and working conditions. The two sides have since failed to reach an agreement, with federal mediators concluding a few weeks ago that negotiations were too far apart.The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) denounced the government's order ""in the strongest terms"". In a statement on Friday, the CUPW called the move an ""assault on our constitutionally protected right to collectively bargain and to strike"".Meanwhile, Canada Post said in a statement that it looks forward to welcoming its employees back to work and resuming its services.The Crown corporation added that it remains committed to reaching a negotiated agreement with the union, but said it wants to do so while ""also meeting the postal needs of Canadians.""The Canadian Industrial Relations Board is expected to rule on Minister MacKinnon's request next week.The strike has impacted businesses during one of the biggest shopping periods of the year. With deliveries halted, inventory has sat in warehouses across the country while shipping costs have increased.Lorne James, an Ontario business owner, told the BBC last week that he fears the strike is ""going to wipe out a good number of businesses"" due to steep financial losses.In Canada's northern communities - where Canada Post is the sole mail delivery provider - the strike has had a profound impact on those who rely on the postal service for the delivery of essentials, like medicine and cheque payments.Service Canada has also reportedly withheld the delivery of 85,000 passports and other important documents while the strike is ongoing.Announcing the order on Friday, Minister MacKinnon said ""Canadians are rightly fed up"" with the strike. He added that it is not a decision he takes lightly, ""but in this situation, it is the right one.""The order would ask striking employees to go back to work under their existing collective agreement until 22 May, by which then the minister hopes a new agreement will be in place.The union has been trying to negotiate a wage increase of 19% over the next four years - higher than the 11.5% increase initially proposed by Canada Post. They are also negotiating issues around benefits, sick leave, job conditions and security.""Our demands are reasonable: fair wages, safe working conditions, the right to retire with dignity and the expansion of services at the public post office,"" the union has said.CUPW national president Jan Simpson has since accused Canada Post of dragging its feet so the federal government can intervene. Meanwhile, Canada Post accused the union of increasing their demands instead of reaching a compromise.When the strike began, Canada Post warned that its services would continue to be disrupted even if an agreement is reached due to backlogs in deliveries.It added that it has already felt a financial impact, with customers switching to private competitors or stopping use of its services altogether as the strike is ongoing.The last Canada post began in October 2018 and ended after more than a month when the federal government mandated that employees go back to work through legislation.That job action cost Canada Post around C$135m ($96.7m; £76.27m)."
UK 'doesn't have enough builders' for Labour's 1.5m homesBuilders and developers say reforms are needed to recruit more tradespeople to build the homes being promised.3 days agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg1471rwpo,"The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.The government confirmed there was a ""dire shortage"" of construction workers but said it was ""taking steps to rectify"" the problem. Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.And on Thursday he unveiled sweepingchanges to the planning system and vowed to override ""blockers"" standing in the way of building the new homes.Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineersThe HBF said while the industry had ""the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out"".When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: ""The short answer is no.""He told the BBC the government would have to ""revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production"" for their target to be met.""They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,"" Mr Thomas said.But the HBF also said the UK ""does not have a sufficient talent pipeline"" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.The industry body admitted the sector itself had not ""attracted"" enough new recruits in recent years.All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said. Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.""If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,"" he said.The average rates of pay for these jobs ""are high"" but the issue was ""more about availability of labour with skills, he said.An experienced bricklayer can earn around £45,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about £38,000 and electricians £44,000, according to government figures. Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and ""restrictions"" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that ""in hindsight"", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the ""norm"".According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.Last month, the government announced £140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established ""homebuilding skills hubs"" to fast-track training.A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to ""make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously"".But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said theywere ""unrealistic"" and ""impossible to achieve"".The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said ""a more pro-development policy approach"" would enable the industry to ""invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply"".Despite recruitment challenges, Barratt Redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what Barratt itself forecast,before the merger with Redrowin October."
"Milei, Musk and Maga: Is Argentina influencing the US?As Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.3 days agoLatin America",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y86vv0wneo,"As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US.Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.Despite his tough austerity measures anda continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according toa survey carried out earlier this monthby the CB Consultora organisation.That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can ""make Argentina great again"". Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is ""experiencing a giant improvement"" under his leadership.But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed? Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before beingrenationalised in 2008.All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-calledDepartment of Government Efficiency- a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (£1.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing ""a fantastic job"" in Argentina by ""deleting entire departments"" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing. But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that ""taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense"".""The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.""Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was ""bursting into crisis every few years"".""That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else."" Marcelo J García, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a ""masterpiece"" of political marketing that has ""captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe"".But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.""I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,"" he told the BBC.He points out that Trump's policies ""require big government in some areas"", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. ""You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.""In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government. Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the ""woke agenda"". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.While he is in favour of Mercosur's recentfree-trade deal with the European Union,he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur ""has ended up becoming a prison"".""If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?"" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose ablanket 25% tariffon goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US. Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: ""You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.""The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.As Marcelo J García sees it, Milei is a ""divisive leader"" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.""The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,"" he says.""Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,"" he adds.In his view, this is a real weakness: ""You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.""Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam."
BBC complains to Apple over misleading shooting headlineApple's new artificial intelligence features falsely made it seem the BBC reported Luigi Mangione had shot himself.3 days agoTechnology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno,"The BBC has complained to Apple after the tech giant's new iPhone feature generated a false headline about a high-profile murder in the United States.Apple Intelligence, launched in the UKearlier this week, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to summarise and group together notifications.This week, the AI-powered summary falsely made it appear BBC News had published an article claiming Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. He has not.A spokesperson from the BBC said the corporation had contacted Apple ""to raise this concern and fix the problem"".Apple declined to comment. ""BBC News is the most trusted news media in the world,"" the BBC spokesperson added.""It is essential to us that our audiences can trust any information or journalism published in our name and that includes notifications.""The notification which made a false claim about Mangione was otherwise accurate in its summaries about the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria and an update on South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.But the BBC does not appear to be the only news publisher which has had headlines misrepresented by Apple's new AI tech.On 21 November, three articles on different topics from the New York Times were grouped together in one notification - with one part reading ""Netanyahu arrested"", referring to the Israeli prime minister.It was inaccurately summarising a newspaper report about the International Criminal Court issuing an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, rather than any reporting about him being arrested.The mistake was highlighted on Blueskyby a journalist with the US investigative journalism website ProPublica.The BBC has not been able to independently verify the screenshot, and the New York Times declined to comment to BBC News. Apple says one of the reasons people might like its AI-powered notification summaries is to help reduce the interruptions caused by ongoing notifications, and to allow the user to prioritise more important notices.It is only available on certain iPhones - those using the iOS 18.1 system version or later on recent devices (all iPhone 16 phones, the 15 Pro, and the 15 Pro Max). It is also available on some iPads and Macs.Prof Petros Iosifidis, a professor in media policy at City University in London, told BBC News the mistake by Apple ""looks embarrassing"".""I can see the pressure getting to the market first, but I am surprised that Apple put their name on such demonstrably half-baked product,"" he said.""Yes, potential advantages are there - but the technology is not there yet and there is a real danger of spreading disinformation.""The grouped notifications are marked with a specific icon, and users can report any concerns they have on a notification summary on their devices. Apple has not outlined how many reports it has received.Apple Intelligence does not just summarise the articles of publishers, and it has been reported the summaries of emails and text messageshave occasionally not quite hit the mark.And this is not the first time a big tech company has discovered AI summaries do not always work.In May, in what Google described as ""isolated examples"", its AI Overviews tool for internet searches told some users looking for how to make cheese stick to pizza should consider using ""non-toxic glue"".The search engine's AI-generated responses also saidgeologists recommend humans eat one rock per day."
3 days agoInfluencer's brand faces backlash over bullying claimsFans are outraged by allegations of body-shaming and a toxic workplace at fashion company Djerf Avenue.3 days agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4pkypde42o,"Swedish clothing brand Djerf Avenue is facing a backlash from fans following claims of bullying and body-shaming against its founder Matilda Djerf.An investigation by Swedish news outletAftonbladetreported that 11 current and former employees described being belittled, called names and yelled at in the workplace.Ms Djerf, 27, told the BBC she was ""deeply sorry"" to anyone who has felt mistreated under her leadership.But customers like 22-year-old Sumi Mrkulic have vowed to ""never purchase anything or voice support again"". Sumi, from London, said she was particularly concerned after Aftonbladet reported that some models were told they didn't fill out a pair of jeans, while others were called fat.Djerf Avenue'swebsitepromotes a world ""filled with kindness, inspiration, and respect,"" and the brand is known for its size inclusivity and diverse model representation.Sumi told the BBC: ""It renders all of their efforts to be inclusive completely performative. I actually find it really spineless.""Influencer Matilda Djerf launched the brand in 2019 and it quickly became popular with young women. It says it made around $35m (£27.5m) in revenue last year.It recently held its first 10-day pop-up shop in London, which saw queues forming up to three hours before the store opened. Giulia Carrozzo, 20, from Germany, received an order from Djerf Avenue the day before the allegations emerged. She said she would be sending it back in light of the report.""Djerf Avenue has always marketed itself as a body-positive, inclusive and empowering brand, so hearing allegations of body-shaming and a toxic work environment felt like a complete betrayal of the values they claim to uphold,"" she said.""I knew immediately that this wasn't something I could support.""Matilda Djerf, who started her online career in 2016, was recognised for her work within retail and e-commerce on the Forbes 30 under 30 list in 2023.Giulia said: ""To me, supporting a brand led by a woman felt like celebrating progress and uplifting women in business. However, these allegations... directly contradict those values.""I can't justify supporting a brand that doesn't practise the values it promotes. Until there's real accountability and change, I won't be purchasing from them."" Matilda Djerf said in a statement: ""If any team member has felt mistreated in their role because of my actions, I am deeply sorry, and I want to sincerely apologize.""I don't recognize myself in all the claims that have been made, and I've chosen not to comment on individual cases. However, I do believe it's valuable that these concerns are being raised, as it gives both me and Djerf Avenue the opportunity to grow and improve.""I want to emphasize that I take full responsibility and see this as a chance to reflect, grow, and contribute to a better culture for everyone at Djerf Avenue.""Djerf Avenue's chief operating officer, Pernilla Bonny, said the company acknowledged the challenges in its workplace environment and had taken steps to address them.These actions include conducting monthly anonymous employee surveys, implementing an independent whistleblower function, strengthening the management team and carrying out an independent workplace assessment with an external psychologist."
"4 days agoN Korea made millions from remote work scheme, US saysFourteen North Koreans have been charged with fraud in the US over an alleged long-running conspiracy.4 days agoAsia",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdnz3elwzvo,"A federal court in St Louis has indicted 14 North Koreans for allegedly being part of a long-running conspiracy aimed at extorting funds from US companies and funneling money to Pyongyang's weapons programmes.The wider scheme allegedly involves thousands of North Korean IT workers who use false, stolen, and borrowed identities from people in the US and other countries to get hired and work remotely for US firms.The indictement says the defendants and others working with them generated at least $88m (£51.5m) for the North Korean regime over a six-year period.North Korea's mission to the UN did not immediately reply to a request for comment from BBC News. The prosecutors say the suspects worked for two North Korean-controlled companies - China-based Yanbian Silverstar and Russia-based Volasys Silverstar.They were among a group of 130 North Korean IT workers employed by the two firms where they were internally referred to as ""IT Warriors"", according to the US Department of Justice.The suspects were allegedly ordered to seek salaries of $10,000 a month from their US employers.On top of the monthly wage, they would also raise funds for the North Korean regime by stealing valuable company information and threatening to leak it unless the employer made an extortion payment.The group is now facing wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other charges.Aside from using stolen identities to avoid detection, prosecutors said they paid people residing in the US to receive, set up, and host laptops provided by the US employers.They would then instruct those US residents to install remote access software allowing them to appear to be working from the US when they were actually overseas.Investigators believe the suspects are in North Korea making it unlikely that they will ever face justice.Still, the US State Department has announced that it will offer a reward of up to $5m for anyone who can provide more information on the suspects as well as Yanbian and Volasys.US officials have not named the American companies targeted in the scheme.""While we have disrupted this group and identified its leadership, this is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Ashley T. Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI's field office in St Louis.""The government of North Korea has trained and deployed thousands of IT workers to perpetrate this same scheme against US companies every day."""
3 days agoUK economy shrinks for second month in a rowThe economy had been expected to return to growth but it contracted by 0.1%.3 days agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5lw84w1yeo,"The UK economy shrank for the second month in a row in October as concerns about the Budget continued to weigh on confidence.Official figures showed a 0.1% drop, despite expectations that the economy would return to growth after a fall in September.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that activity had stalled or declined with pubs, restaurants and retail among sectors reporting ""weak months"".Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the figure was ""disappointing"", but added: ""We have put in place policies to deliver long-term economic growth."" Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: ""This fall in growth shows the stark impact of the chancellor's decisions and continually talking down the economy.""KPMG's chief economist Yael Selfin said that activity was ""held back by uncertainty ahead of the Budget on 30 October"" as businesses and consumers held back on spending.But some industries, such as real estate, law firms and accountancy, brought forward work before Reeves announced the Budget, the ONS said.Separately, a survey measuring consumer confidence in December found people were a little more positive about their personal finances for the year ahead.But the findings from market research firm GfK found that ""views on the economy are unchanged from November which suggests people don't know where we are going"".""In a nutshell, it's the continuing uncharitable view on the UK's general economic situation that's suppressing consumer confidence,"" said Neil Bellamy, consumer insights director at NIQ GfK.Shortly after becoming prime minister in July, Sir Keir Starmer warned that the Budget would be ""painful"" following 14 years of Tory government.He later denied that he was talking down the economy.The economy has grown just once over the past five months, ONS figures show. Capital Economics said GDP was 0.1% lower than before Labour won the election in July.""That suggests it's not just the Budget that is holding the economy back,"" said Capital's chief UK economist Paul Dales.""Instead, the drag from higher interest rates may be lasting longer than we thought.""The Bank of England has cut interest rates twice this year but, at 4.75%, they are still relatively high compared with recent years.The Bank will meet next week for the last interest rate decision of 2024, though it is not widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again until next year.Economists cautioned about placing too much emphasis on the reading for October.  It is an initial estimate of economic growth by the ONS and could be revised.Over the three months to October, the economy expanded by 0.1%. The manufacturing industry recorded the sharpest drop in activity in October, down 0.6%, followed by construction which fell by 0.4%.Meanwhile, the services sector, which makes up the bulk of the UK economy,  stalled with zero growth.Rick Gaglio, owner of menswear shop Twisted Fabric in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, said ""people are still being cautious"", and added that prices are still comparatively high.""That's just down to inflation and customers are feeling those price increases,"" he said. Mr Gaglio also said that retail sales were slow during the summer months due to wetter than usual weather.""It's been tough,"" he said. ""2024 generally for small businesses has been very, very tough and we just want to hear more good news, not bad news.""Sir Keir has said he wants the UK to secure the highest sustained economic growth of the G7 group of rich nations.Last week, he set out additional ""milestones"" to allow people to measure the government's progress. On the economy, he has pledged to increase real household disposable income per person.He also reiterated a promise to build 1.5 million homes in England.

4 days agoWhy 'digital twins' could speed up drug discoveryAI can create digital humans and digital organs that can be used in clinical trials.4 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8v73dkne3o,"This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments.The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.As these differences often aren’t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.“This allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,” says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson. In 2018 an investigation by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalistsrevealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.“To really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,"" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.""So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.“Even a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.""You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.”Ms Macpherson adds: “[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.” Adsilico’s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.Adsilico’s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants. More on AI and Medicine Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.Sanofi’s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process. “With a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,” says Matt Truppo, Sanofi’s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.“There is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.” Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.""[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.”Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks. Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.“A virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,” she says."
3 days agoSome businesses suspend NI sales due to new trade rulesRules come into force that will make it harder for some GB firms to sell goods to NI and the EU.3 days agoNorthern Ireland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ydrp0kjn5o,"New rules that affect businesses in Great Britain selling to Northern Ireland and the EU are a ""step backwards"", according to a London-based small business owner.The EU's General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR) creates new requirements for Great Britain businesses, including the need to have an agent in Northern Ireland or the EU.This has prompted some businesses to stop or suspend sales to Northern Ireland and the EU.The government said it has been supporting small and medium businesses across the UK to get ready for GPSR.However, Johanna Haughey-Lewis, the owner of homewares business Weirdstock, said ""there hasn't been enough time or enough information in order to get this right"". The rule change applies to Great Britain products going to Northern Ireland because Northern Ireland's Brexit deal means it is still effectively in the EU's single market for goods.Weirdstock, which sells bedding, is among those that have decided to pause shipping to the EU and Northern Ireland.Ms Haughey-Lewis, who is originally from County Armagh, said she found out about the new rules ""through a social media post a couple of weeks ago"".""Whenever you look at the government website, the information on GPSR only came up there very recently, so not enough time for businesses to prepare,"" she toldBBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.""Even some of the bigger retail stockists that I am with have only communicated about this for the first time this week, a few days before the deadline.""So it's not just the small businesses that aren't aware of it; there has been no kind of campaign or information about it,"" she added. Ms Haughey-Lewis informed her customers of the changes on social media.""As many of you know I am from Northern Ireland, Weirdstock has a wee customer base there so I am finding this particularly frustrating.""But at the same time I am determined to find a solution,"" she wrote.She said her Northern Ireland connection may potentially make it easier for her to find an agent but there are other challenges.The new requirements include the need to provide documentation to demonstrate the safety of your product.""There is no template for that, no guidance. It is very hard to find information on that,"" Ms Haughey-Lewis said.""This new legislation which feels like it has come out of nowhere, a bit of a surprise to me, it really has felt like a step backwards"".She is hoping that because her textile supplier in India is certified by global sustainability bodies it means the safety and traceability evidence will be there, but for now she is not clear exactly what she has to provide.""Hopefully I will be in a better position than other people because I have those certifications already,"" she added. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said that the UK government and local politicians had ""abandoned many traders"" who he said were now ""affected by mad EU trade rules"".Wilson told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that he wrote to the government in September to warn them of these issues but that ""nothing has been done"".Alliance Party assembly member Kate Nicholl said there were ""clear issues with communication and how the government have been engaging with those businesses"".She said Brexit had been a ""disaster"" for Northern Ireland, but that removing the current trade regulations under the Windsor Framework would cause ""even more damage and uncertainty for businesses in Northern Ireland"".""We just have to try to find solutions of how we can make this as easy as possible,"" she said. The EU has been working on GPSR since 2020 and it was approved by the European Parliament in May 2023.It updates existing rules to reflect the growth of online commerce and aims to give better protections for consumers.That include the need to have a ""responsible person"", which is effectively a compliance agent, inside the EU or Northern Ireland.That is a particular challenge for small businesses in Great Britain who are selling direct to consumers, therefore they have no physical presence in the EU or Northern Ireland.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) is calling on the government to give better export support to firms.Tina McKenzie, policy chair at the FSB, said: ""GPSR will be a real barrier to international trade for some of our small firms looking to export to EU member states, but also move goods to Northern Ireland.""While the UK government's newly published guidance is helpful, small firms are still faced with the complexity and associated costs around it.""Governments from both sides should look at removing unnecessary trade barriers, not least those arising from the product safety rules, for small businesses in the UK-EU Trade and Cooperative Agreement review in 2026.""It is understood the government expects GPSR to have a limited impact on the UK internal market as it largely formalises the reality of how many businesses are already operating."
"Telegram pushes extremist groups to users - studyCivil rights group examined 28,000 channels, finding white nationalist groups among those promoted.2 hrs agoTechnology",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgrvw29x4jo,"The social media platform Telegram uses an algorithm that promotes extremist content, a new study shared exclusively with the BBC has revealed.The report, from the US civil rights organisation the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), found that the ""similar channels"" feature introduced last year recommends extremist channels even to users browsing subjects such as celebrities or technology.A professor also showed BBC Panorama how he found someone within moments on Telegram who offered to ship an Uzi submachine gun to the UK for £850.Telegram says users are ""only presented with content they have chosen to engage with"" and it removes millions of pieces of harmful content daily. The company's founder, Russian billionaire Pavel Durov, is under formal investigation in France accused of failing to stop criminality on his platform.He has denied the allegations.Best known as a messaging app marketed with secretive features, Telegram also allows its almost one billion users to set up channels where they can broadcast messages and videos to up to 200,000 people at a time.SPLC researchers looked at 28,000 of these Telegram channelsfor their report Telegram's Toxic Recommendations.It found that users browsing mundane topics would be recommended extreme content - while users looking at one form of extreme content, such as anti-government conspiracies, would be pushed towards other extremist ideologies such as antisemitism or white nationalism. Lead researcher Megan Squire demonstrated how the algorithm works by searching for ""Donald Trump"" in a newly set up Telegram account.Immediately in the ""similar channels"" recommendations were multiple examples of channels promoting the Q-Anon conspiracy, which maintains with zero evidence that Mr Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media.Another search for ""UK riots"" showed a meme about Adolf Hitler as the first result, followed by suggestions for a series of channels run by violent far-right groups. ""Some of these groups are pretty active. You're not just on Telegram getting memes, you're getting shuffled into to actual events. They're having events on the ground with people showing up,"" Ms Squire said.In the hours after the Southport knife attack in August, which prompted riots, Telegram users posted some of the first calls for protest, along with false claims the suspected attacker was an asylum seeker.Ms Squire told BBC Panorama that the research showed Telegram had become a ""digital threat"".""On a scale of one to 10, Telegram I would say is an 11. It's dishing out enormous amounts of criminal content, extremist content. It is extremely dangerous in my opinion,"" she said. A former insider who was part of Telegram's inner circle for seven years, Elies Campo, told Panorama that he had challenged Pavel Durov about extreme material in 2021.""His stance was it's not up to a platform like us to decide who should be speaking out. It was clear that he didn't want to dedicate more resources to it,"" Mr Campo said.""I think if he could choose, he would choose more a stand where he doesn't have to moderate anything.""Prof David Maimon from Georgia State University, who has spent six years studying illegal content on Telegram, said there were tens of thousands of channels offering everything from tools for scammers to guns. ""Telegram is definitely one of the most important platforms criminals are using now for criminality,"" he said.He showed Panorama how within moments of posting a message saying he needed ""an Uzi and a shotgun"", a seller posted a picture of an Uzi and said he could ""get it fast-tracked"" to the programme's address in Belfast within two or three days.The French authorities have accused Pavel Durov of complicity in drug dealing, organised crime and sharing child abuse images on Telegram. He is currently on bail and is not allowed to leave France.Telegram says it takes extremist and illegal content very seriously and its moderation teams and AI tool remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.It says its users only receive the content to which they have subscribed - as Telegram does not ""inject or promote content"".""The 'channel suggestions' feature shows only channels with the same topic as those a user already follows. This approach ensures that users are only presented with content they have chosen to engage with. This is completely different from how other platforms make suggestions,"" the company said.Telegram said ''it does not amplify content, but instead shows topic-based suggestions tied to user choices""."
'World-first' AI camera targets drink-driversDrink and drug-drivers in Devon and Cornwall are in the cross-hairs of a pioneering AI camera.2 days agoEngland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0rqz003zdo,"Motorists under the influence of alcohol or drugs could be caught by a pioneering AI camera which is being tested for the first time in Devon and Cornwall.The state-of-the-art Heads-Up machine can detect road use and behaviour consistent with drivers who may be impaired by drink or drugs.Police further up the road can stop the vehicle, talk to the driver and do a roadside test for alcohol and illegal drugs.Geoff Collins, UK general manager of camera developer Acusensus, said: ""We are delighted to be conducting the world's first trials of this technology right here in Devon and Cornwall."" The camera can be moved quickly to any road in either county, without warning, with drivers unaware they have been spotted until police pull them over.""We are all safer if we can detect impairment before it causes an incident that could ruin lives,"" said Mr Collins.Acusensus cameras have previously been used to help police catch drivers using mobile phones at the wheel or not wearing seatbelts.With drink-drivers six times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash,Devon & Cornwall Policeare hoping the Heads-Up system will help to save lives.

"What we know about mysterious drones over New Jersey and other statesThe US government says the flying objects pose no threat to national security, but their origin and intentions remain unclear.21 hrs agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62785697v0o,"Mystery continues to swirl after nearly a month of drone sightings over New Jersey and other US states, alarming some residents.US authorities have been unable to provide definitive answers, saying only that the objects are not believed to pose a danger to the public or national security.On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed the sightings included drones, as well as manned aircraft commonly mistaken for drones.He added that he knows of ""no foreign involvement"" to do with the unmanned aerial vehicles.Some lawmakers have criticised the government's handling of the drone reports and the lack of public information.Here's what we know. Dozens of drone sightings have been reported overNew Jerseysince 18 November, but others have been reported around the US north-east.Some of the flights were spotted near Picatinny Arsenal - a sensitive military research facility - as well as near President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in the town of Bedminster, New Jersey.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has since issued temporary flight restrictions prohibiting drone flights over Bedminster and Picatinny.Sightings have also been reported in several other states:InNew York City, several drones were reported flying over the Bronx on 12 DecemberStewart Airfield inNew Yorkstate had to shut down for about an hour on 13 December because of drone activity, Governor Kathy Hochul saidInConnecticut, police confirmed ""suspicious drone activity"". A drone detection system is now in use near the towns of Groton and New LondonInMaryland, former Republican Governor Larry Hogan said he saw what appeared to be ""dozens"" of drones over his home in DavidsonvilleInMassachusetts, two men were arrested on 14 December after a ""hazardous drone operation"" near Logan International Airport's airspace in Boston, police saidMultiple sightings have been reported in easternPennsylvania,including over PhiladelphiaIn October, the Wall Street Journal reported that mysterious drones were seen for 17 days near US military facilities inVirginiaIn late November, drones were also spotted over three US airbases in the UK, with British defence sources telling the BBC suspicion had fallen on a ""state actor"".Drones were also reported near the Ramstein US military airbase in Germany in early December.Are mystery drones above US bases in England something sinister? In a call with reporters, officials from several US agencies said there was no evidence of any threat to public safety.""I think there has been a slight overreaction,"" an official from the FBI said.The homeland security secretary told ABC News on Sunday he knows of ""no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the north-east"".""And we are vigilant in investigating this matter,"" he said.Mayorkas added: ""If there is any reason for concern, if we identify any foreign involvement or criminal activity, we will communicate with the American public accordingly."" Following a briefing with the Department of Homeland Security on 11 December, New Jersey assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia said the drones appeared to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.Fantasia said the aircraft were up to 6ft (1.8m) in diameter, travelling with lights turned off and ""operate in a co-ordinated manner"".Secretary Mayorkas told ABC that an explanation for the uptick in drone sightings could be to do with a change in federal law last year that allowed drones to be flown at night.""That may be one of the reasons why now people are seeing more drones than they did before, especially from dawn to dusk,"" he said. It is unclear who might be operating them.New Jersey Republican representative Jeff Van Drew said that the drones were coming from an Iranian ""mothership"" in the Atlantic, while Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi said there was a ""non-trivial"" chance that China could be involved.The Pentagon, White House and homeland security department have all insisted that there is no foreign origin for the objects.A northern California man was charged on with flying a drone over and taking pictures of Vandenberg Space Force Base, located near Santa Barbara, on 30 November.The man, 39-year-old Chinese national Yinpiao Zhou was arrested just before he boarded a flight to China.But there has been no suggestion this incident has any connection with the spate of drone reports on the other side of the country. President-elect Trump has suggested the drones couldn't be flying without the government's knowledge.""Let the public know, and now,"" he wrote on his Truth Social media platform. ""Otherwise, shoot them down.""Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, also said the drones should be shot down.Shooting down drones is illegal, however.New York State Governor Hochul has called on the federal government to allow states to crack down on the drones.Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has requested that federal officials send drone detection systems to New York and New Jersey.In a statement, the FAA warned that drone operators who conduct unsafe or dangerous operations could face fines of up to $75,000 (£59,000) and have their drone pilot certificates revoked."
"Two arrested after 'hazardous drone operation' near Boston airportThe flying objects were spotted flying ""dangerously close"" to Logan International Airport, said police.21 hrs agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvnnj8g34o,"Two people have been arrested after allegedly conducting a ""hazardous drone operation"" near the airspace of the US city of Boston's main airport, police said.Robert Duffy, 42, and Jeremy Folcik, 32, were arrested on Long Island, part of the Boston Harbor Islands, on Saturday night.They were charged with trespassing and police said they may face further counts and fines over the drones, which were ""dangerously close"" to Logan International Airport.Their arrests follow a series of drone sightings across the US north-east in recent weeks. Police have given no indication that the sightings are connected to these arrests. Police said the incident in Boston occurred at 16:30 local time (21:30 GMT) on Saturday when a police officer detected a drone operating ""dangerously close"" to Logan International Airport.Police said they identified the drone's location and tracked the operators' position to a decommissioned health campus on Long Island. Because of the drone's proximity to an airport, FBI counter-terrorism agents helped the investigation.What we know about the mysterious drones buzzing over New JerseyWhen officers arrived on the scene, police said three people attempted to flee, two of whom - Mr Duffy and Mr Folcik - were apprehended. A drone was discovered in a backpack carried by Mr Duffy, police said.The third suspect is believed to have fled the island in a small vessel and has not so far been found.It was not immediately clear whether Mr Duffy and Mr Folcik had legal representation. Police said they were yet to be arraigned. US government officials have been seeking to reassure residents of the north-east that no national or public security threats have been identified in the hundreds of drone sightings.Flying objects have been reported in states including New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Massachusetts, but most of the sightings have been in New Jersey.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC News on Sunday the federal government was working in ""close co-ordination"" with state and local authorities on the issue.He said it was ""critical"" they be given the ability to counter drone activity under federal supervision.Mayorkas said the rise in drone sightings could be down to a change in federal law last year that allows the aircraft to be flown at night.""That may be one of the reasons why now people are seeing more drones than they did before, especially from dawn to dusk,"" he said.He also said he knew of ""no foreign involvement"" in drone sightings around the US north-east.New York Governor Kathy Hochul has called for Congress to grant states more powers to tackle the drones, which forced runways at Stewart Airfield in the state to shut down for about an hour on Friday night.She said on Sunday that federal officials were sending a drone detection system to New York.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has requested that the technology also be sent to New Jersey."
7 hrs agoSocial media given 'last chance' to tackle illegal postsPlatforms have three months to take action or they could be fined up to 10% of global turnover.7 hrs agoTechnology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy83jdpgw5o,"Online platforms must begin assessing whether their services expose users to illegal material by 16 March 2025 or face financial punishments as the Online Safety Act (OSA) begins taking effect.Ofcom, the regulator enforcing the UK's internet safety law, published its final codes of practice for how firms should deal with illegal online content on Monday.Platforms have three months to carry out risk assessments identifying potential harms on their services or they could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover.Ofcom head Dame Melanie Dawes told BBC News this was the ""last chance"" for industry to make changes. ""If they don't start to seriously change the way they operate their services, then I think those demands for things likebans for children on social mediaare going to get more and more vigorous,"" she said.""I'm asking the industry now to get moving, and if they don't they will be hearing from us with enforcement action from March.""Under Ofcom's codes, platforms will need to identify if, where and how illegal content might appear on their services and ways they will stop it reaching usersAccording to the OSA, this includes content relating to child sexual abuse material (CSAM), controlling or coercive behaviour, extreme sexual violence, promoting or facilitating suicide and self-harm.What is the Online Safety Act - and how can you keep children safe onlineBut critics say the Act fails to tackle a wide range of harms for children.The Molly Rose Foundation - set up in memory of teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after being exposed to self-harm images on social media - said the OSA has ""deep structural issues"".Andy Burrows, its chief executive, said the organisation was""astonished and disappointed"" by a lack of specific, targeted measures for platforms on dealing with suicide and self-harm material in Ofcom's guidance.""Robust regulation remains the best way to tackle illegal content, but it simply isn't acceptable for the regulator to take a gradualist approach to immediate threats to life,"" he said.And children's charity the NSPCC has also voiced its concerns.""We are deeply concerned that some of the largest services will not be required to take down the most egregious forms of illegal content, including child sexual abuse material,"" said acting chief Maria Neophytou.""Today's proposals will at best lock in the inertia to act, and at worst create a loophole which means services can evade tackling abuse in private messaging without fear of enforcement.""The OSA became law in October 2023, following years of wrangling by politicians over its detail and scope, and campaigning by people concerned over the impact of social media on young people.Ofcom began consulting on its illegal content codesthat November, and says it has now ""strengthened"" its guidance for tech firms in several areas. Ofcom says its codes include greater clarity around requirements to take down intimate image abuse content, and more guidance on how to identify and remove material related to women being coerced into sex work.It also includes child safety features such as ensuring that social media platforms stop suggesting people befriend children's accounts and warnings about risks of sharing personal information.Certain platforms must also use a technology called hash-matching to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) - a requirement that now applies to smaller file hosting and storage sites.Hash matching is where media is given a unique digital signature which can be checked against hashes belonging to known content - in this case, databases of known CSAM.Many large tech firms have already brought in safety measures for teenage users andcontrols to give parents more oversight of their social media activityin a bid to tackle dangers for teens and pre-empt regulations.For instance, on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, users under the age of 18 cannot be discovered in search or messaged by accounts they do not follow.In October, Instagram alsostarted blocking some screenshots in direct messagesto try and combat sextortion attempts - which experts have warned are on the rise, often targeting young men.Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said Ofcom's publication of its codes was a ""significant step"" towards the government's aim of making the internet safer for people in the UK.""These laws mark a fundamental reset in society's expectations of technology companies,"" he said.""I expect them to deliver and will be watching closely to make sure they do."" Concerns have been raised throughout the OSA's journey over its rules applying to a huge number of varied online services - with campaigners also frequently warning about the privacy implications of platform age verification requirements.And parents of children who died after exposure to illegal or harmful content have previouslycriticised Ofcom for moving at a ""snail's pace"".The regulator's illegal content codes will still need to be approved by parliament before they can come fully into force on 17 March.But platforms are being told now, with the presumption that the codes will have no issue passing through parliament, and firms must have measures in place to prevent users from accessing outlawed material by this date."
13 hrs agoHospitals to use AI to cut patient visitsThe technology will analyse the data from an app used by patients with chronic respiratory illness.13 hrs agoHull & East Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c745q8w25keo,"An NHS trust hopes to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to improve a scheme that helps patients across Hull and East Yorkshire with chronic respiratory illness.The Lenus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) support system sees patients use an app to keep track of their symptoms.The Humber Health Partnership said there had been a 40% reduction in the number of patients needing to go back to hospital for treatment since the system was launched in March 2023.It hopes to reduce the figure even further - possibly by as much as 90% - by using AI technology to analyse the data from the app. The app encourages patients to regularly answer questions about their well-being so data can be gathered.It also allows them to message their NHS clinic directly.Professor Mike Crooks, who runs the service, said: ""This prompts them to make contact to initiate treatment early, so that we can give them the care they need to get them back on the right path before the point they need to come into hospital.""AI will be used to analyse the data and help medical professionals identify trends and triggers that can result in COPD needing care, Professor Crooks said.This will allow the clinic to put interventions in place to support patients before they reach the point of needing hospital care.Ruth was diagnosed with COPD at the age of 14 and has been using the Lenus app as part of her treatment.Before using the app, she was visiting the hospital three or four times a year.""Now those visits have been cut down to virtually zero,"" she said.""If I need to reach out to a clinician, I know that the app's there and I can do that.""

2 days agoOld hospital gowns made into octopus IV drip hooksA sustainable design graduate has created an octopus out of old gowns to cheer up sick children.2 days agoCornwall,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyxr882kp0o,"Old hospital gowns are being turned into octopus shaped poles for intravenous (IV) drips, in the hope of cheering up child patients.Product designer Florence Mitchell came up with the idea for Olly the Octopus when she was in the third year of her sustainable product design degree at Falmouth University in Cornwall.The fully-recycled cartoon-style blue octopuses are made out of old polypropylene gowns from the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro.She said she ""felt like he needed to be engaging, not just be a static thing that stands in the corner, but to bring him to life a bit"". Ms Mitchell got the idea after visiting the hospital and speaking to staff who identified that standard IV poles break easily.""Once broken, they need to be completely thrown out and then bought again new"", she said.The octopuses also have an interactive element.""I thought it would be awesome if we could make that into an app where 'Olly' comes to life.""Not only in a way that he moves, but more interactively, where kids can take their medication with him and feed him and maybe we can bring an element into this where parents can also log on and see how their kids are doing in terms of their mood.""So, it was something that could potentially relieve some of that anxiety for parents as well as making the experience for kids more engaging.""Other design considerations involved making it something that could be easily removed by staff on the wards, and making sure the weight could be taken by the poles.Ms Mitchell said they are designed to hold three times more weight than standard IV hooks, with 10 tentacles representing NHS values. She now hopes to improve the product by making it more sustainable, and to develop it for wider use.""I'd really love to see Olly in hospitals, if possible,"" she said.Kelly Mengham, ward sister for the Gastro and Liver Unit, helped Ms Mitchell set up the project during the early stages and said it was an ""outstanding product"".""I can't wait to see Olly in action"", she added.

4 days agoControversial chatbot's safety measures 'a sticking plaster'Character.ai is facing legal action in the US over claims a bot on the site encouraged a teenager to kill his parents.4 days agoTechnology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zgd3kk50o,"Chatbot platform Character.ai is overhauling the way it works for teenagers, promising it will become a ""safe"" space with added controls for parents.The site is facing two lawsuits in the US - one over the death of a teenager - and has been branded a ""clear and present danger"" to young people.It says safety will now be ""infused"" in all it does through new features which will tell parents how their child is using the platform - including how much time they're spending talking to chatbots and the ones they speak to the most.The platform - which allows users to create digital personalities they can interact with - will get its ""first iteration"" of parental controls by the end of March 2025.But Andy Burrows, head of the Molly Rose Foundation, called the announcement ""a belated, reactive and completely unsatisfactory response"" which he said ""seems like a sticking plaster fix to their fundamental safety issues"". ""It will be an early test for Ofcom to get to grips with platforms like Character.ai and to take action against their persistent failure to tackle completely avoidable harm,"" he said.Character.aiwas criticised in Octoberwhen chatbot versions of the teenagers Molly Russell and Brianna Ghey were found on the platform.And the new safety features come as it faces legal action in the US over concerns about how it has handled child safety in the past,with one family claiminga chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a ""reasonable response"" to them limiting his screen time. The new features include giving users a notification after they have been talking to a chatbot for an hour, and introducing new disclaimers.Users will now be shown further warnings that they are talking to a chatbot rather than a real person - and to treat what it says as fiction.And it is adding additional disclaimers to chatbots which purport to be psychologists or therapists, to tell users not to rely on them for professional advice.Social media expert Matt Navarra said he believed the move to introduce new safety features ""reflects a growing recognition of the challenges posed by the rapid integration of AI into our daily lives"".""These systems aren't just delivering content, they're simulating interactions and relationships which can create unique risks, particularly around trust and misinformation,"" he said.""I think Character.ai is tackling an important vulnerability, the potential for misuse or for young users to encounter inappropriate content.""It's a smart move, and one that acknowledges the evolving expectations around responsible AI development.""But he said while the changes were encouraging, he was interested in seeing how the safeguards hold up as Character.ai continues to get bigger."
4 days agoMark Zuckerberg's Meta donates $1m to Trump fundIt appears to be the latest attempt by the Meta boss to build a closer relationship with the incoming president.4 days agoTechnology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j9e1x9z2xo,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has donated $1m (£786,000) to an inauguration fund for President-elect Donald Trump.The tech giant's boss, Mark Zuckerberg,dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lagoresort in November, having sought to repair his and his firm's relationship with Trump following the election.Trump previously was highly critical of Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook - calling the platform ""anti-Trump"" in 2017.Meta is not believed to have made similar donations to President Joe Biden's  inaugural fund in 2020 or to Trump's previous inaugural fund in 2016. The company confirmed its million-dollar donation to the inaugural fund to several outlets on Wednesday.Inauguration funds are used to pay for events and activities when a new president takes office - some consider them an attempt to curry favour with a new administration.The donation was confirmed by CBS, the BBC's US media partner, on Wednesday, and wasfirst reportedby the Wall Street Journal.The BBC has approached Meta for comment.Trump will be sworn in as the 47th US president on 20 January. Relations between Trump and Mr Zuckerberg historically have been far less cordial.They particularly soured when Facebook and Instagram suspended the former president's accounts in 2021, after they said he praised those engaged in violence at the Capitol on 6 January.Since then, Trump has waged a war of words against Meta - calling Facebookan ""enemy of the people"" in March.He said a law that would ban TikTok in the US unless sold off by its parent company, ByteDance, would unfairly benefit Facebook.In August, Mr Zuckerberg told Republican lawmakers in a letter thathe regretted bowing to pressure from the Biden administrationto ""censor"" some Facebook and Instagram content during the coronavirus pandemic.Trump wrote in a book published in September that Mr Zuckerberg would ""spend the rest of his life in prison"" if he tried to intervene in the 2024 election.But the president-elect appears to have since softened his position.He told a podcast in October it was ""nice"" Mr Zuckerberg was ""staying out of the election"", and thanked him for a personal phone call after he faced an assassination attempt.Still, Mr Zuckerberg isn't nearly as close to Trump as fellow tech titan Elon Musk.The Tesla and X owner has been dubbed Trump's ""First Buddy"" because of his extensive donations to his election campaign.That led to Mr Musk being placed in charge of a newDepartment of Government Efficiency (Doge).There has been no such rapprochement between Mr Musk and Mr Zuckerberg - although the cage fight between them that was once mootednow appears to be off."

5 days ago'Christmas lights' galaxy reveals how Universe formedThe galaxy resembling Christmas lights hanging in the cosmos has space scientists feeling festive5 days agoScience & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr0j7625kzo,"Nasa’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has for the first time captured an image of what our galaxy likely looked like just as it was forming - and it's got space scientists feeling very Christmassy.“I just love the sparkle galaxy with its Christmas lights shining as it was when the Universe was just 600 million years old,” Prof Catherine Heymans, Scotland’s Astronomer Royal, told BBC News.The image shows ten balls of stars of different colours, appearing like Christmas tree baubles hanging in the cosmos.It's the first time that scientists have witnessed clumps of stars assembling to form a galaxy like our own Milky Way and holds clues as to how the Universe was formed. Scientists have named the distant galaxy Firefly Sparkle, because it also looks like a swarm of multi-coloured fireflies.From its orbit in space unhindered by Earth's atmosphere, the most powerful telescope ever built has already shown usmore distant and therefore older galaxies,but not one like our own in the early stages of forming and not in such detail.“The data of what happened at this stage of the Universe is very sparse,” according to Dr Lamiya Mowla of Wellesley College in Massachusetts, who co-led the research.“But here, we are actually watching a galaxy as it is being formed brick by brick. The galaxies we normally see around us are already formed so this is the first time we have seen this process,” she told BBC News. Prof Heymans, Scotland’s Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team, described the discovery as “gorgeous, scientifically important and extremely festive”.“I find it amazing that humans have built a telescope that allows us to peer so far back in time and that we can see these very nascent phases of the galaxy in such a beautifully festive way.”The star clusters are of different colours because they are at different stages in their formation, according to Dr Mowla.“It is so beautiful because the early life of a galaxy is extremely active,"" she said. ""There is so much happening, there are new stars being born, there are massive stars dying, there is a lot of gas and dust around it and there is nitrogen and oxygen and because of the state they are in, you have these lovely colours.“We are able to tell something about the ages of each cluster, the composition of their elements and the temperatures at which they formed.”When Dr Mowla came across the galaxy, she had never seen clumps of stars in such vivid and varying colours. It led her to believe that there was something different about this system, so she checked how far away it was.To her surprise it turned out to be more than 13 billion light years away.The light from Firefly Sparkle is from not long after the creation of the Universe and so has taken more than 13 billion years to reach us. It is so small and so far away that not even JWST would have been able to see it, were it not for an extremely lucky cosmic coincidence. There was a cluster of galaxies exactly between Firefly Sparkle and the JWST, which distorted spacetime to stretch the light from the faraway galaxy and effectively act as a gigantic magnifying glass.Astronomers call this process gravitational lensing, which in this instance enabled the research co-lead Dr Kartheik Iyer of Columbia University in New York, and other members of the team, to see for the first time, incredible details of how the first galaxies like our own Milky Way formed.“It takes the light coming from the firefly and bends it and amplifies it so we can see it in glorious detail,” he told BBC News.""Our reconstruction shows that clumps of actively forming stars are surrounded by diffuse light from other stars. This galaxy is literally in the process of assembling.""""When it does all this and we are able to see this incredible faraway galaxy, it is a very humbling, magical feeling.”The research has been published in the journal Nature."
"Israeli strikes kill 50 in Gaza, Hamas-run health ministry saysThe Israeli military says Sunday's strikes targeted sites used by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.6 hrs agoMiddle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rnvy1zn10o,"More than 50 people were killed in Israeli air and ground attacks across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, according to local medics and rescuers.They said children, a cameraman who worked for the Al Jazeera TV network and personnel from the Civil Defence agency were among the dead.The Israeli military said it targeted sites used by Hamas and the allied armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad.The Hamas-run health ministry said the deaths meant the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza during the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas had surpassed 45,000. The ministry does not make a distinction between combatants and civilians, but it reported in October that 29,980 children, women and elderly were among the identified fatalities.The figures are often disputed by the Israeli government, which says almost 20,000 ""terrorists"" have been killed, but they are broadly accepted by UN agencies.The war began when Hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Many of those killed on Sunday were in a UN-run school being used as a shelter for displaced families in the southern city of Khan Younis.Harrowing footage showed a bloody scene on the third floor of Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz School, with children's bodies apparently among those being removed.""People were safe, staying in their homes after they prayed the dinner prayer. They were sitting, sleeping, and staying put in their places,"" Manal Tafesh, whose brother and his children were among those killed, told Reuters news agency outside a local mortuary.Medics said at least 13 people were killed, while a spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said she had heard reports of around 20 casualties, many of them women and children.""It's just doesn't stop. It's so relentless the pain and the suffering that we continue to have,"" Louise Wateridge told the BBC from central Gaza.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had ""conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists who were operating inside a command-and-control centre"" embedded within the school.It also accused Hamas and other armed groups of exploiting civilians and using civilian infrastructure as human shields.Medics said several more people were killed at another school-turned-shelter in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, which the UN said has been under siege by Israeli forces for more than two months.The UN said it was monitoring reports that more than 1,500 people were newly displaced after Israeli forces besieged Khalil Aweida school and shelled it.The IDF said on Sunday that its forces ""conducted a targeted raid on a terrorist meeting point in the Beit Hanoun area"".""In co-operation with the [Israeli Air Force], the troops struck dozens of terrorists from both the air and ground, and additional terrorists were apprehended,"" it added. Another strike hit a Civil Defence building in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said the strike killed the directors of its Nuseirat and Sheikh Radwan centres along with two volunteers, one of whom he named as Ahmad Baker al-Louh. Another five people were injured, three of them critically, he added.""The Israeli occupation has once again shown the world that there is no protection for humanitarian workers in Gaza and no adherence to international humanitarian laws,"" he said, adding that 94 Civil Defence workers had been killed since the start of the war.Ahmad al-Louh was a cameraman for the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network, which strongly condemned what it called Israel's ""targeted killing"" of its journalist.It said Louh had been covering a rescue operation by the Civil Defence following an earlier strike on Sunday and that it came ""just days after the targeting of his house"".""The network calls on all human rights and media organisations to condemn the Israeli occupation's systematic killing of journalists in cold blood, the evasion of responsibilities under international humanitarian law, and to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice,"" a statement said.The IDF said the Civil Defence building was used by ""terrorists to plan and carry out an imminent terror attack against IDF troops"".""Among the terrorists eliminated in the strike was the Islamic Jihad terrorist Ahmad Bakr al-Louh, who previously served as a platoon commander in the Islamic Jihad's Central Camps Brigade,"" it alleged, without providing any evidence.Al Jazeera did not comment on the Israeli allegation, butLouh's cousin Mahmoud told the Associated Press: ""We were stunned by the Israeli occupation statement.""""These claims are lies and misleading to cover up this crime,"" he added.The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 137 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began."
Ireland's Israel stance 'more extreme than any other country'The Israeli ambassador to Ireland says the decision to close its embassy was tough but not taken lightly.2 hrs agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0nwd9n9ylo,"Ireland has taken ""a more extreme stance than any other country"" against Israel, the Israeli ambassador to the country has said.Dana Erlich was speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ after her country's decision to close its embassy in Ireland.Erlich said the ""tough decision"" was not taken lightly.Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris said that he did not regret the Irish government's intervention in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) case in relation to Israel. Ireland had previously indicated its support for South Africa's legal action against Israel in the ICJ, saying it would ask the court ""to broaden its interpretation of what constitutes the commission of genocide by a state"".Harris has also rejected that Ireland is anti-Israel.However, speaking on RTÉ News at One, Erlich said of Ireland's request to the ICJ: ""This is an abuse of the international multilateral system by South Africa, we were sorry to see Ireland join it, but this joins an accumulation of steps, rhetoric and initiatives that we've seen Ireland trying to promote this past year.""Unfortunately in the past year we've seen Ireland position itself in an extreme position that no other country has put itself.""In most countries we have difficult conversations and we have disagreements – we accept criticism, but this has gone over that line in Ireland.""We see Ireland in a more extreme stance than any other country.""Erlich said she heard concerns from the Jewish and Israeli communities in Ireland.""We direct those concerns to the Irish government, the government that needs to make sure that they are safe, that there is a future for the Jewish community in Ireland,"" she said.""These assurances need to be made."" The taoiseach said his ""priority is to shine a spotlight on what is happening in the Middle East and we should not allow anything to distract from what is happening"".He said although he regretted the actions of the Israeli government regarding the embassy closure, he emphasised the importance of diplomatic relations and that Ireland would continue to engage with Israel.""I'm very proud of the decision Ireland has taken, we are pro human rights and international law,"" he added.Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said the Irish government must ""hold firm"" on its stance with regard to Israel and Gaza.McDonald described the move by Israel over its embassy in Dublin as an attempt to test the will of the Irish government.""We need to work with others to bring as much pressure as possible on the [Benjamin] Netanyahu regime,"" she said. Ireland's Jewish Representative Council chairperson said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the deterioration in the relationship between the Ireland and Israel.Chairperson Maurice Cohen said that the closure of Israel's embassy has caused distress for Israeli people in Ireland.He said the Irish government's intervention in the ICJ risks ""oversimplifying a highly complex and tragic conflict, unfairly isolating Israel, and undermining the integrity of the term 'genocide'.""Mr Cohen said that for the Jewish community in Ireland, ""the closure of the embassy represents not only a symbolic blow but also a practical disadvantage"".""Consular services provided by the embassy are vital for those maintaining connections with family, culture, and heritage in Israel,"" he added.""Losing this resource will leave many feeling unsupported and aggrieved.""Closing the embassy risks alienating a significant segment of Irish society and sends a message that dialogue is being replaced by disengagement.""He said that the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland reaffirmed its commitment to peace and the protection of innocent lives ""on all sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict"", while also supporting Israel's right to defend itself from ""terrorism and existential threats"".Mr Cohen called on both the Irish and Israeli governments to seek pathways to rebuild trust and to ensure avenues for diplomatic engagement remain open. Daniel Epstein-O'Dowd, from the Ireland Israel Alliance, told BBC News NI that it was a ""predictable"" decision by Israel to close its embassy in Dublin and that ""post October 7th there has just been provocation after provocation by the Irish government"".He said it is a ""very symbolic move by Israel and showing that they ultimately don't see any value in retaining any diplomatic presence"" in the Republic of Ireland.""There are many Israelis who are in the tech industry here in Dublin who are a little bit stranded and isolated quite frankly, they feel the Israeli embassy was very much there for them, particularly in the dark days immediately post October 7th, the embassy really shone through in the sense of that community,"" he added.""So I think it is wondering where do they go next?""I don't think that detail has yet been released, but I think it is ultimately going to be somewhere else other than Ireland, it's a very sad day for anybody in Ireland or Israel."" Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said there are no plans to close its embassy in Israel.On 7 October last year, Hamas launched an attack in southern Israel killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.In retaliation, Israel launched a massive operation inside the Gaza Strip with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas.So far, at least 44,875 people have been killed and more than 100,000 injured - mostly civilians, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The UN regards these figures as reliable."
"Amnesty accuses Israel of genocide against Palestinians in GazaIsrael denies the accusation, saying it is defending itself against Hamas attacks in accordance with international law.5 Dec 2024Middle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwl0v4w5j3o,"Amnesty International has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza war, which Israel strongly denies.The UK-based human rights group said its conclusion was based on “dehumanising and genocidal statements” by Israeli officials, digital images and witness testimony and must serve as “a wake-up call” to the international community.Israel’s foreign ministry describedthe 295-page reportas “entirely false and based on lies”, while the Israeli military said the claims were “entirely baseless and fail to account for the operational realities” it faces.In the past day, meanwhile, local medics say at least 50 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza. The biggest number of people were killed in the al-Mawasi tent camp for displaced people, where Israel says it was targeting Hamas operatives. Amnesty says that its research over months “has found sufficient basis to conclude that Israel has committed - and is continuing to commit - genocide against Palestinians”.The 1948 Genocide Convention, enacted following the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.Agnès Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary general, said Israeli actions “include killings, causing serious bodily or mental harm and deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction"".“Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,” she continued.The report by the global campaign group comes as the UN’s top court, the International Court of Justice at The Hague, continues to examine allegations by South Africa that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.Israel has called the case ""wholly unfounded"" and based on ""biased and false claims"".Responding to the allegations by Amnesty, Israel’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, described the human rights group as a “deplorable and fanatical organisation”.“The genocidal massacre on 7 October 2023, was carried out by the Hamas terrorist organisation against Israeli citizens,” he stated, adding that Israel as acting in self-defence and “fully in accordance with international law"".The Israeli military said it was “actively working to dismantle Hamas’ military infrastructure” in Gaza and that it “takes all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians during operations"".About 1,200 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, were killed during the Hamas-led attacks 15 months ago, which triggered the Gaza war.Since then, at least 44,532 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen as reliable by the UN. In the past day, Israel has continued to carry out attacks across the length of the Palestinian territory.At least 23 people were killed and many more wounded in an air strike on a camp for displaced people in al-Mawasi in Khan Younis. Social media video shows residents battling fires overnight.At the nearby Nasser Hospital, a local BBC cameraman filmed the arrival of the wounded, including blood-stained children and a disabled man. The bodies of two small children were among the dead brought wrapped up in blankets.Israel’s military said its attack targeted senior Hamas operatives acting in what it considers a humanitarian zone. “Following the strike, secondary explosions were identified, suggesting the presence of weaponry in the area,” it said in a statement.It said it had taken steps “to mitigate the risk of harming civilians” and accused Hamas of using civilians “as human shields for terrorist activity"".On Thursday, BBC footage showed people picking through the mangled wrecks of shacks and piles of ash.“The strike hit us without any warning and did this big massacre,” Mohammed Abu Shahli said. “The people here are refugees from different places - from Rafah and the north. They came to a place they thought was safe.”His head bandaged, Abdul Rahman Jamaa said seven members of his family were killed including his father and three brothers.He told the BBC: “There are no protected safe areas as the Israelis say. These are all lies.  May God protect us.”"
"Israel says body of hostage Itay Svirsky recovered from GazaThe military says he was murdered by Hamas, which has claimed he was killed by an Israeli strike.4 Dec 2024Middle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjgevlv839o,"The Israeli military says the body of an Israeli hostage held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip has been recovered in a joint operation with the Shin Bet security service.A statement said Itay Svirsky, 38, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri during Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, was “murdered in captivity by his captors”.Hamas said in January that Svirsky and another hostage, Yossi Sharabi, 53, had been killed by Israeli air strikes.Earlier, the military said an investigation had concluded that the most plausible explanation for the deaths of six other hostages found dead in a tunnel in Gaza in August was that they were shot by Hamas ""close"" to the time of an Israeli air strike. Troops recovered the bodies of Yagev Buchshtab, 35, Alexander Dancyg, 76, Avraham Munder, 79, Yoram Metzger, 80, Chaim Peri, 79, and Nadav Popplewell, a 51-year-old British-Israeli dual national, along with those of six Hamas fighters, in the southern Khan Younis area.The military said it was “highly probable"" the hostages' deaths were related to a February strike on a nearby underground site that targeted Hamas commanders.Pathologists found indications of gunshots on the hostages’ bodies, while no gunshot wounds were found on the fighters' bodies, it added.Due to the extended time that had passed ""it was not possible to determine with complete certainty the precise cause of death of the hostages or the exact timing of the gunfire”, according to the military.“According to the most plausible scenario, the terrorists shot the hostages close to the time of the strike,” it said. “However, it is also possible that the hostages were shot by other terrorists post-mortem; it is even possible that the hostages were killed prior to the strike in the area.”An Israeli military official told reporters that the military believed the six Hamas fighters “were killed from secondary effects of our strike"", like lack of oxygen.The military also stressed that it had ""no information”, at the time of the strike that the hostages were in the underground site that was targeted or its vicinity.“Had such information been available, the strike would not have been carried out,” it said, noting that it was preceded by the required planning and approval process.There was no immediate comment from Hamas. Buchshtab, Dancyg, Munder, Metzger, Peri and Popplewell were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and Kibbutz Nirim on 7 October 2023.About 1,200 people were killed by Hamas-led gunmen that day, while 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages.The US, Egypt and Qatar have spent months working on a deal to secure the release of the 96 remaining hostages, 34 of whom are presumed dead, in return for a ceasefire in Gaza.But the negotiations have stalled, with Hamas and Israel blaming each other for the impasse.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the military investigation’s findings ""serve as yet another proof that the lives of hostages face constant, daily danger”.“Time is of the essence - many of the hostages are still alive and enduring impossible conditions of abuse, starvation and isolation,” it warned.The forum called on US and the other mediators to “do everything necessary to achieve a deal for the hostages' return”.It separately welcomed the return of Itay Svirsky's body for burial in Israel, saying it ""provides crucial closure for his family"".Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Wednesday that ""pressure on the monstrous organisation known as Hamas is growing"".“There is a chance that this time we will truly be able to advance a hostage deal.” More than 44,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.On Wednesday evening, at least 20 people were killed by an air strike in the Israeli-designated “humanitarian area” in al-Mawasi, west of Khan Younis, according to medics and the Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency.Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal said a tented camp for displaced families was bombed and that the dead included five children.The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted ""senior Hamas terrorists"" in the area.Another 10 people were killed when Israeli strikes hit three houses in Gaza City, in northern Gaza, according to Mr Bassal.Earlier, five people were killed in an Israeli strike on the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, medics said. Local media said four of the dead were children and that the strike had targeted a queue outside a bakery.The Israeli military said it had struck a “terrorist target” in Nuseirat, without giving any details, according to the Associated Press."
"Gazans displaced by war now face a new threat: winterPalestinians displaced by the war are living on Gaza's coast, exposing them to harsh winter storms.3 Dec 2024Middle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqdr0591qro,"The beaches of Gaza are no longer for day trips. Tens of thousands of people now have to live on the coastline, forced to leave their homes during the war.In recent days they have come under a new kind of assault: from winter seas battering their flimsy, makeshift dwellings.“Nothing is left in the tent: not mattresses, bedding, bread, everything was taken. The sea took it,” says Mohammed al-Halabi, in Deir al-Balah.“We rescued a two-month-old child who was dragged out to sea.”Nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is now displaced and nine in ten of those living in shelters are in tents, the UN says.With temperatures plummeting, many people have been falling sick. There have been floods of rainwater and sewage.“My children’s feet, their heads—everything is freezing,” Shaima Issa tells the BBC in Khan Younis. “My daughter has a fever because of the cold. We’re essentially living on the streets, surrounded by strips of fabric.  Everyone here is sick and coughing.”“When it rains on us, we’re drenched,” adds her neighbour, Salwa Abu Nimer, crying.  “The heavy rain floods us, and we don’t have a waterproof cover. The water seeps into the tent, we wear our clothes wet.”“No flour, no food, no drink, no shelter,” she went on. “What is this life I’m living? I go to the ends of the earth just to feed my children.” While the situation is worst in the north, UN officials are warning of dire shortages of medicines, food, shelter and fuel across Gaza, describing the situation as “catastrophic.”There are long queues for charity handouts in parts of central and southern Gaza where most people are living.On successive days, our local cameramen have filmed hundreds of people crowding outside bakeries where there is very little bread.  At times, there are crushes as those waiting surge forward.“I need a loaf of bread. I have pain, diabetes, and high blood pressure. I can’t push through crowds of people; I’m afraid I’ll suffocate and die,” says Hanan al-Shamali, who is in Deir al-Balah but originally comes from northern Gaza.“I need bread so that I can feed the orphans I take care of. Every morning, I come here.  In the end, do I get bread or not? Sometimes I get it, but most of the time, I don’t.” At the Kerem Shalom crossing, Israel’s main crossing point with Gaza, last week journalists were shown lorries moving goods that had gone through security checks.Aid entering the Palestinian territory remains at some of the lowest levels of the past year.  Israel blames aid agencies for distribution problems.“Unfortunately we're still seeing that the biggest backlog for humanitarian aid getting to where it needs to get to is the distribution capabilities of the international organisations, as the 800 trucks worth of aid around me attest to,"" said Shimon Freedman, spokesman for Cogat, part of the Israeli military that control the crossings.But inside Gaza, humanitarian workers sayarmed gangs have been looting incoming suppliesbrought through Kerem Shalom amid increased lawlessness. This has now led the biggest UN agency operating in the territory, Unrwa, to pause its use of this route for deliveries.The overall picture, says Antoine Renard, local head of the UN’s World Food Programme, is of Palestinians facing “a daily struggle for survival”.""The levels of hunger, devastation and destruction we are seeing now in Gaza is worse than ever before. People cannot cope anymore,” Mr Renard says. “There is barely any food coming in while markets are empty.”Amid the destruction in Gaza, there is still no end in sight to the war. Just the expectation of more suffering, as cold weather sets in."
"Last bone surgeon in northern Gaza killed, Palestinians sayDr Sayeed Joudeh had come out of retirement to help during the war between Israel and Hamas.3 days ago",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv3m71g1q0o,"A doctor believed to be the last remaining orthopaedic surgeon in northern Gaza has been killed by Israeli tankfire, according to Palestinian officials.Dr Sayeed Joudeh died on Thursday while he was on his way to work.He was a surgeon at Kamal Adwan and al-Awda hospitals in northern Gaza.The Israeli military said it was unaware of the incident, but it was investigating. The grandfather had come out of retirement to help during the war.Last month speaking at a press conference at the Kamal Adwan Hospital, he held up a placard that read ""Save US"".It didn't work.""On his way to al-Awda Hospital to evaluate a patient, one of the tanks fired on him directly,"" according to Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital.""Unfortunately, he was killed instantly.""But some eyewitnesses say Dr Joudeh was shot by a drone. Israel does not allow foreign journalists unrestricted access to Gaza.But from Jerusalem, I spoke to Louise Wateridge from the main United Nations aid agency in Gaza.""It's devastating for his family. It's devastating for people in the north who are relying on so few doctors,"" said Ms Wateridge.""Hospitals in the Gaza Strip are not hospitals anymore,"" she said.""There's no sanitation. There are hardly any doctors. There's no medical equipment. Patients are dying needlessly.""Ms Wateridge described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as apocalyptic.For more than two months much of Northern Gaza has been under Israeli siege and bombardment.Israel says it is targeting Hamas operatives who have been regrouping there. On 7 October last year, Hamas launched an attack in southern Israel killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.In retaliation, Israel launched a massive operation inside the Gaza Strip with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas.So far, at least 44,875 people have been killed and more than 100,000 injured - mostly civilians, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The UN regards these figures as reliable.At least 30 of them were killed - and another 50 wounded - in an Israeli strike on a post office turned shelter for displaced people in central Gaza on Thursday night, according to local medics.Locals say Gazans displaced by the 14-month conflict were sheltering there and that many members of one extended family had been killed.The Israeli military said it was targeting a senior Islamic Jihad member behind attacks on Israeli civilians and troops.It accused the armed group of exploiting Gaza's civilians as human shields for its activities."
"Israeli strikes kill 12 guarding Gaza aid lorries, medics sayThe Israeli military says it targeted two groups of Hamas members who planned to hijack the lorries.4 days agoMiddle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk0x64ll8jo,"At least 35 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, including 12 guarding incoming aid lorries, local medics and the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority say.Seven guards were killed in a strike in Rafah while protecting aid lorries from violent armed theft, which UN workers say is the main obstacle to getting supplies into southern Gaza. Another attack left five guards dead in Khan Younis.The Israeli military said it ""conducted precise strikes on armed Hamas terrorists"" who had planned to hijack the lorries.In a separate Israeli attack, 15 people were killed near Nuseirat refugee camp, the Civil Defence said. ""The occupation once again targeted those securing the aid trucks,"" Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal told the AFP news agency.He added that around 30 people, most of them children, were also wounded in the two strikes.The lorries were carrying flour to warehouses belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Mr Basal said.Recently - amid severe food shortages - UN workers say violent armed thefts have been the main obstacle to getting aid into the southern part of Gaza. Civilians, as well as remnants of Hamas police, have mobilised to try to counter the gangs.Hamas says Israeli military strikes have killed at least 700 police tasked with securing aid lorries in Gaza since the latest war began on 7 October 2023.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""Overnight, following intelligence information indicating the presence of Hamas terrorists, the IDF conducted precise strikes on armed Hamas terrorists gathered at two different meeting points in southern Gaza.""It added that ""all of the terrorists that were eliminated were members of Hamas and planned to violently hijack humanitarian aid trucks and transfer them to Hamas"".Separately, Israeli air strikes on two homes near Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, and Gaza City, in the north, killed 21 more people, the Civil Defence said.At least six children were among the 15 people killed in Nuseirat, while the bodies of six other people were found after a strike on an apartment in Gaza City, Mr Basal said.Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the Palestinian group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 44,800 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.After months of failed international efforts to end the war, Israel's defence minister has told his US counterpart there is a chance for a new deal that would allow the return of all of the remaining hostages, including American citizens.Other reports have suggested a limited deal with Hamas is being discussed."
"The Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for the Middle EastWhat the latest developments mean for Iran's position - and for the prospect of peace in Gaza27 Nov 2024BBC InDepth",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygn5579gvo,"Listen to Jeremy read this articleFor most of the people of Lebanon, a ceasefire could not come quickly enough. A leading Lebanese analyst at a conference on the Middle East that I’m attending in Rome said she couldn’t sleep as the appointed hour for the ceasefire came closer.“It was like the night before Christmas when you’re a kid. I couldn’t wait for it to happen.”You can see why there’s relief. More than 3,500 citizens of Lebanon have been killed in Israeli strikes. Displaced people packed their cars before dawn to try to get back to whatever remains of their homes.Well over one million of them have been forced to flee by Israeli military action. Thousands have been wounded and the homes of tens of thousands of others have been destroyed.But in Israel, some feel they have lost the chance to do more damage to Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met the heads of Israel’s northern municipalities, which have been turned into ghost towns with around 60,000civilians evacuatedfurther south.Israel’s Ynet news website reported that it was an angry meeting that turned into a shouting match, with some of the local officials frustrated that Israel was taking the pressure off their enemies in Lebanon and not offering an immediate plan to get civilians home.In a newspaper column, the mayor of Kiryat Shmona, close to the border, said he doubted the ceasefire would be enforced, demanding that Israel creates abuffer zone in south Lebanon. In a poll commissioned by the Israeli station Channel 12 News those questioned were roughly split between supporters and opponents of the ceasefire.Half of the participants in the survey believe Hezbollah has not been defeated and 30% think the ceasefire will collapse. Back in late September, at the UN General Assembly in New York, a deal looked as if it was close. Diplomats from the US and UK were convinced that a ceasefire very similar to the one that is now coming into force was about to happen.All sides in the war appeared to have signalled their willingness to accept a ceasefire based on the provisions of Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed to end the 2006 Lebanon war: Hezbollah would pull back from the border to be replaced by UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese Armed Forces. As they moved in, Israeli forces would gradually move out.But Prime Minister Netanyahu went to the podium at the UN to deliver a fiery speech that refused to accept any pause in Israel’s offensive.Back at his New York hotel Netanyahu’s official photographer captured the moment as he ordered the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, along with most of his high command. Netanyahu’s office released the photos, in another calculated snub for American diplomacy.The assassination was a significant escalation and a blow to Hezbollah. In the weeks since, Israel’s military has inflicted immense damage to Hezbollah’s military organisation. It could still fire rockets over the border and its fighters continued to engage Israel’s invasion force. ButHezbollah is no longer the same threatto Israel. Military success is one of several factors that have come together to persuade Benjamin Netanyahu that this is a good time to stop.Israel’s agenda in Lebanon is more limited than in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories. It wants to push Hezbollah back from its northern border and to allow civilians to return to border towns.If Hezbollah looks to be preparing an attack, Israel has a side letter from the Americans agreeing that it can take military action.In a recorded statement announcing his decision, Netanyahu listed the reasons why it was time for a ceasefire. Israel, he said, had made the ground in Beirut shake. Now there was a chance ‘to give our forces a breather and replenish stocks,’ he continued.Israel had also broken the connection between Gaza and Lebanon. After the late Hassan Nasrallah ordered the attacks on Israel’s north, the day after Hamas went to war on 7 October last year, he said they would continue until there was a ceasefire in Gaza. Now, Netanyahu said, Hamas in Gaza would be under even more pressure. Palestinians fear another escalation in Israel’s Gaza offensive.There was one more reason; to concentrate on what Netanyahu called the Iranian threat. Damaging Hezbollah means damaging Iran. It was built up by the Iranians to create a threat right on Israel’s border. Hezbollah became the strongest part of Iran’s axis of resistance, the name it gave to its network of forward defence made up of allies and proxies. Just like Hezbollah’s surviving leaders, their patrons in Iran also wanted a ceasefire. Hezbollah needs a pause to lick its wounds. Iran needs to stop the geostrategic bleeding. Its axis of resistance is no longer a deterrent. Iran’s missile attack on Israel after Nasrallah’s assassination did not repair the damage.Two men, both now assassinated, designed Hezbollah to deter Israel not just from attacking Lebanon – but also from attacking Iran. They were Qasem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, who was killed by an American drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020. The order was issued by Donald Trump in his last few weeks in the White House at the end of his first term. The other was Hassan Nasrallah, killed by a huge Israeli air strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs.Hezbollah and Iran’s deterrence strategy matchedIsrael’s own deterrencefor almost 20 years after the end of the 2006 war. But among the profound changes caused by the 7 October attacks was Israel’s determination not to accept restrictions on the wars it would wage in response. America, its most important ally, also put almost no restrictions on the supply or use of the weapons it kept on providing.Nasrallah and Iran failed to see what had happened. They did not understand how Israel had changed.  They sought to impose a war of attrition on Israel, and succeeded for almost a year. Then on 17 September Israel broke out of it by triggering the miniature bombs built into the network of booby-trapped pagers its intelligence services had duped Hezbollah into buying.Hezbollah was thrown off balance. Before it could react with the most powerful weapons Iran had provided, Israel killed Nasrallah and most of his key lieutenants, accompanied by massive strikes that destroyed arms dumps. That was followed by an invasion of South Lebanon and the wholesale destruction of Lebanese border villages as well as Hezbollah’s tunnel network. A ceasefire in Lebanon is not necessarily a precursor to one in Gaza. Gaza is different. The war there is about more than security of the border, and Israeli hostages.It is also about revenge, about Benjamin Netanyahu’s political survival, and his government’s absolute rejection of Palestinian aspirations for independence.The Lebanon ceasefire is fragile and deliberately paced to buy time for it to work. When the 60 days in which it is supposed to take effect ends, Donald Trump will be back in the Oval Office. President-elect Trump has indicated that he wants a ceasefire in Lebanon, but his precise plans have not yet emerged. The Middle East is waiting for the ways he might affect the region. Some optimists hope that he might want to create a moment akin to President Nixon’s sensational visit to China in 1972 by reaching out to Iran.The pessimists fear he might abandon even the hollow genuflection that the US still makes to the idea of a creating an independent Palestine alongside Israel – the so-called two state solution. That might pave the way to annexation of those parts of the occupied Palestinian territories Israel wants, including much of the West Bank and northern Gaza.What is certain though is that theMiddle East has no chance of escapingmore generations of war and violent death until the region’s fundamental political ruptures are faced and fixed. The biggest is the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, along with most Israelis believe it is possible to dominate their enemies by pressing on to a military victory. Netanyahu is actively using force, unrestrained by the US, to alter the balance of power in the Middle East in Israel’s favour.In a conflict that has lasted more than a century both Arabs and Jews have dreamt repeatedly of peace through military victory. Every generation has tried and failed. The catastrophic consequences of the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 ripped away any pretence that the conflict could be managed while Israel continued to deny Palestinian rights to self-determination. The ceasefire in Lebanon is a respite. It is not a solution.Top picture credit: Getty Images BBC InDepthis the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

"Remembering the man who became Indian music's global ambassadorZakir Hussain, legendary tabla virtuoso, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy.11 hrs agoAsia",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwype77kwyjo,"Zakir Hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of Indian classical musicwho has died aged 73, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy that will inspire generations.A child prodigy, he collaborated with Indian classical icons like Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, and Shivkumar Sharma and global musicians like John McLaughlin and George Harrison.Born on 9 March, 1951, in Mahim, Mumbai, he was the eldest son of Ustad Allarakha, one of history's most iconic players of the tabla - a pair of traditional Indian hand played drums.Hussain's journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation.Hussain's life revolved around rhythm from the very beginning.The sound of the tabla was his first language, his earliest ""words"". By the age of 12, he was already performing globally, accompanying stalwarts like Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan during his teenage years.While rooted in the Hindustani classical tradition, Hussain possessed an insatiable curiosity that propelled him to explore other genres, leading to ground-breaking collaborations across the world.In 1973, he co-founded Shakti with guitarist John McLaughlin, a group that fused Indian classical music with jazz and Western traditions, creating a new global sound.Over five decades, Shakti evolved, featuring luminaries like violinist L Shankar, percussionist Vikku Vinayakram, and mandolin maestro U Srinivas.Their first studio album in 46 years, This Moment, won the Grammy for Best Global Music Album in 2024, marking a fitting finale to their 50th-anniversary tour. Hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to Shakti's success and to the global appreciation of Indian rhythms. Zakir Hussain's contributions extended far beyond Shakti.He was a key collaborator in Planet Drum and Global Drum Project, both with Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, earning him Grammy Awards in 1991 and 2008.He worked with banjo maestro Béla Fleck and bassist Edgar Meyer on the Grammy-winning As We Speak (2024), further cementing his status as a pioneer of cross-genre collaborations. He also collaborated with musicians as diverse as Yo-Yo Ma, George Harrison, Van Morrison and Billy Cobham, bringing Indian classical music to global audiences.His ventures like Tabla Beat Science, a fusion of Indian classical music with electronic and world music, and orchestral works such asPeshkarfor the Symphony Orchestra of India showcased his unrelenting drive to innovate while respecting his roots.""The moment you think you're a maestro, you are distancing yourself from the others,"" Hussain toldRolling Stone Indiamagazine earlier this year. ""You have to be part of a group, and not dominate it.""This philosophy made him not only a consummate artist but also a lifelong learner and mentor.Hussain's flamboyance and speed and precision of his performances earned him widespread admiration.The New York Times, in its review of a 2009 jazz performance at Carnegie Hall, described his artistry as embodying""an impish strain of virtuosity"".""He's a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. So he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings."" His accolades are as numerous as the beats he crafted.A recipient of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, Hussain was also a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow in the United States. He delighted audiences at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and collaborated with jazz legends, Western classical orchestras, and Carnatic music maestros.Despite his global acclaim, Hussain remained deeply connected to his Indian roots. His early years in a modest chawl - large tenement complexes - in Mahim shaped his values.""For the first three-and-a-half years of my life, we all lived in one room that had no toilet. We had to use the common toilets,"" Hussain told Nasreen Munni Kabir.Offstage, Hussain was an avid reader and a fan of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. He loved poetry, cricket, and tennis, counting Roger Federer among his heroes. His curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like Ravi Shankar and Miles Davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. Hussain would also later say that his TV advert for a popular tea brand - Taj Mahal - ""made me famous in India"".Hussain's death marks the end of an era but leaves an indelible mark on global music. Kabir, who chronicled his life, aptly captured his essence: ""Zakir's extraordinary playing and the extreme sense of rigour he brought to his art made him a phenomenon.""Music for Hussain was not just a career but a spiritual journey - a way to connect with people, traditions, and cultures across the globe.In his final years, Hussain remained as active as ever, performing, mentoring, and composing.""Being a student and having a drive to learn keeps me going. The opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself. Age doesn't affect my energy and drive,"" he said last year."
"Jamie Foxx injured in altercation at his birthday dinnerA representative said he ""had to get stitches and is recovering"" after the incident at a Chinese restaurant.1 day agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c140e0pym6lo,"Hollywood actor Jamie Foxx's birthday dinner was cut short after he was involved in an altercation at a Beverly Hills restaurant, leaving him needing stitches, his representative said.The Django Unchained and Ray star was celebrating his 57th birthday on Friday.Someone at another table ""threw a glass that hit him in the mouth"" and the matter is now in ""law enforcement's hands,"" a representative for Foxx told the BBC's US partner CBS News.They added that the actor ""had to get stitches and is recovering"". Officials from Beverly Hills Police Department confirmed police attended Mr Chow, a high-end Chinese restaurant, after reports of an assault with a deadly weapon.Police found there had been a physical fight between two parties at the restaurant, and that reports of assault with a deadly weapon were unfounded. They did not elaborate on what sparked the fight.The representative told CBS News Los Angeles that Foxx was at the restaurant for a celebration, even though police did not specifically name him.The police were called around 10:10 p.m.It's unclear whether any arrests have been made and no other information was provided.The incident comes after Foxx revealedthe cause of his hospital admission in April last year.Speaking during a Netflix special earlier this month, the actor told the audience he'd suffered a ""brain bleed that led to a stroke"".He said he had a bad headache one day and asked for an aspirin, but before he could take it he ""went out (blacked out). I don't remember 20 days"".At the time, his daughter Corinne Foxx said he had experienced a ""medical complication"" but the family did not share details about his health issues.The star won an Oscar for best actor for playing musician Ray Charles in Ray in 2005. He was also nominated for best supporting actor the same year for his role in Collateral.His other films include Baby Driver, Annie and The Amazing Spider-Man 2."
The Christmas number one race - and how to win itAll Mariah and Wham! want for Christmas is a chart-topper. Can a newcomer like Tom Grennan stop them?2 days agoCulture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg6ejq7zpyo,"This year's Christmas number one single will be unwrapped on Friday, with a mixture of old favourites, new efforts and wild cards all in the running.Last year, Wham! classic Last Christmastopped the yuletide singles chart,remarkably for the first time since its release in 1984, when the original Band Aid kept it off the number one spot.As is tradition, the festive number one will be announced on BBC Radio 1's chart show from 16:00 GMT on the Friday before Christmas.At the time of writing, a stocking full of artists - naughty and nice - are hoping to top the list. Wham!'s hit is the frontrunner after reclaiming the top spot in the last chart before the Christmas one, as people streamed it to get into the festive spirit. It has also been reissued on CD and 12-inch vinyl for its 40th anniversary for the final week of the chart race, giving it a further boost.Another seasonal staple,Mariah Carey'sAll I Want for Christmas, is not far behind.Also in this year's mix areBrenda Lee's golden oldie Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and the latest incarnation ofBand Aid.They're joined by a new festive tune byTom Grennan, while songs byAriana GrandeandKelly Clarksonhave established themselves as returning Christmas classics.Or the chart crown could go to something non-Christmassy - like recent hits byGracie Abrams,RoseandBruno Mars, or the fast-risingLola Young.There was a long period when the Christmas number one was reserved for the latest X Factor winner - seven times between 2005-14 - or novelty charity-fundraising sausage-roll enthusiast LadBaby, a five-time victor between 2018-22.And just like with buying gifts, the key for any artists involved now, according to Official Chart Company boss Martin Talbot, is to step into Christmas with confidence and a strategy, and to go early. ""The singles market is very much dominated by streaming these days, in general terms, throughout the year,"" he says.""But the Christmas market is the one market where you can sell a lot of physical [copies and] a lot of downloads and actually make a big difference. Because people want to buy gifts.""That's where Wham! will do really well this year.""Physical or download sales count for much more than streams in the chart in the digital era. ""The other thing is, if you've got a charity record, let's not be shy about it,"" Talbot notes.That's an adage not lost on Bob Geldof and the Band Aid team, who are going again with their own 40th anniversary Ultimate Mix, which has made headlines this timeafter Ed Sheeran saidhe would have preferred for his vocals not to have been used again because of the song's portrayal of Africa.""When people engage with charity records, they're not doing it because they specifically want to listen to the charity record over and over again, Talbot notes.""Streaming doesn't really work."" Instead, he says: ""It's all about voting. And you cast your vote by buying a download or by buying physical products.""East 17,Reverend and the MakersandThe Celebsare all also having a go in aid of various charities this year, as areSouth Yorkshire Fire & Rescue. Mariah's slow-burning 1994 anthem finally topped the UK chart for the first time in 2020,returning to the summit in 2022.Yet despite it being screeched by revellers across the country every December, the unofficial queen of Christmas (her bid to trademark that moniker was denied by US authorities)has never been at the top of the UK chart in Christmas week itself.""It was the first Christmas song I ever wrote and I was just thinking about all the things that I really did want at Christmas,"" sherecently told Rylan in a BBC interview.""I guess I turned it into, if there's something that you love, it means more than all that stuff."" Aww.Her tune, like Wham!'s and Band Aid's, has benefitted from being heavily promoted by streaming services like Spotify, Apple and Amazon on their top Christmas playlists. In recent years, Amazon has thrown its might behind new Christmas songs that are exclusive to its service. They have included Sam Ryder's You're Christmas To Me, which narrowly lost out to Wham! last year, and Ellie Goulding's River, which topped the chart just after Christmas in 2019.This year, Grennan's soulful, lovelorn It Can't Be Christmas is only available via Amazon Music.Grennan, who actually penned the track in Los Angeles in the summer, said it was a ""no-brainer"" for him to team up with the streamer to create his own festive song.Amazon has also commissioned Icelandic-Chinese singer-songwriterLaufey's Christmas Magic.She said being asked to come up with an original to go up against the usual suspects was ""such a fun challenge"".The classically-trained star's jazzy number features in Red One, a holiday-themed action movie starring Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans and Lucy Liu - and made by Amazon. Chart expert James Masterson says the Christmas number one race began as an invention of British bookmakers in 1984.While it used to produce many bona fide pop hits, he believes the concept has been ""ruined"" in recent years, not least by the admittedly well-intentioned LadBaby.""It became pointless speculating as to what was going to be Christmas number one,"" he says of the LadBaby era.""Which is why, when he didn't release a song last year, it left this void and it was a void that nobody came along to fill.""Last Christmas ""won by default"", he says, because it appears at the top of all the Christmas playlists playing ""the same old songs, every single year, in much the same order"". Due to a crowded Christmas market, Masterson says many record labels began to feel it's not worth worrying about the end of year chart any more.Chart rules dictate that songs released in the last three years are weighted more favourably than those already in the Christmas canon.But even with that factor in their favour, he feels it is increasingly difficult for artists with genuinely good new seasonal songs to ""achieve enough momentum"" to ""get lucky"".""My view is that if Last Christmas by Wham! gets the Christmas number one again by default, it would be a disaster for the whole concept,"" he concludes.So anyone launching a late bid - be it fans of the lateLiam Payne, Liberal Democrat leaderEd DaveyorYorkshire Pudding Boy-will probably require a cracking campaign.There have been upsets in the past - fans ofRage Against the Machine's Killing in the Nameput a small-but-welcome dint in the X Factor monopoly in 2009. Talbot thinks that ifSheeran really ""wanted to really go for it"" with Under The Tree, his song from Richard Curtis's That Christmas movie, he could challenge Wham! and  Mariah.Alternatively, the ""Wicked phenomenon could be really powerful"", meaningCynthia Ervivoand Grande's Defying Gravity could pull off a ""surprise"" as families and friends head for outings to the cinema.US pop sensationSabrina Carpenterhas released a Christmas-centric EP, Fruitcake, which could top the festive album chart, but its tracks don't seem to be in the running for the singles crown.So it's beginning to look a lot like Wham! will be Christmas number one again - just like last Christmas.This year's Christmas Number 1 will be revealed on 20 December on theOfficial Chart on Radio with Jack Saunders."
The Wanted singer needs urgent heart-block surgery12 mins agoCulture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4xl549v5go,"Max George, of boy band The Wanted, has said he needs surgery for a heart condition, ""way quicker than the doctors first thought"".Taken into hospital on Wednesday, the singer, 36, had a scan on Monday and then posted: ""We don't have too much time to wait.""He had been diagnosed with ""a 2:1 block in my heart"", George said, wherethe heart beats more slowly or with an abnormal rhythmbecause of a problem with the electrical pulses.It was ""a pretty scary time right now and the last few nights have been really rough"" but he hoped to be out of hospital by Christmas. George's message was accompanied by a series of photos and a video of him on a hospital trolley, with wires attached to his chest, and giving the thumbs up. ""Had a little day trip today,"" he wrote, ""full Cat scan on my heart - not something I'd choose to do again.""As I mentioned yesterday, I have a 2:1 block in my heart.""Unfortunately, my heart rate hasn't picked up at all in almost a week.""Because of this, we don't have too much time to wait.""So it looks like I'm going to be in surgery way quicker than the doctors first thought.""I may even be home for Christmas.""Still a pretty scary time right now and the last few nights have been really rough.""But I wanted to say that I'm absolutely humbled by all your messages of support - both people I know and those I don't.""It's given me a much-needed boost and my family have been overwhelmed with support, which means more to me than anything. Much love, Max."" In a separate video, posted on Sunday, George told followers the scan would determine whether he needed ""a pacemaker, a defibrillator or something else"".""It's the top part not sending signals to the bottom, apparently,"" he said.He was ""feeling OK tonight"", George said in Sunday's video, adding: ""The City game didn't help much,"" in a reference to Manchester City's dramatic late defeat to rivals Manchester United.The British Heart Foundation saysan atrioventricular heart block is when the electrical impulses are delayed or blocked as they travel between the atria (the top chambers of the heart) and the ventricles (the bottom chambers).Heart blocks are graded as first, second or third degree, depending on severity. George rose to fame in the early 2010s, with bandmates Siva Kaneswaran, Nathan Sykes, Jay McGuiness and Tom Parker.The Wanted announced a break in 2014 - and in 2022, George and Kaneswaran relaunched as a duo.George also appeared in Strictly Come Dancing, in 2020.Parker died from brain cancer, aged 33, in March 2022."
Amy Dowden to return to Strictly for live tour5 hrs agoCulture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dpg81p85jo,"Strictly Come Dancing professional Amy Dowden is to return to the show for its live tour.It comes after the 34-year-old, who made a return to the show this year after undergoing treatment for breast cancer, withdrew from the competition in November following an injury.At the time, Dowden said she was ""heartbroken"" to be pulling out of the show due to an ""insufficiency stress fracture"" on her shin.On the tour, beginning this January, the Welsh dancer will perform alongside her celebrity partner JB Gill, who will also dance with Dowden's replacement on the show, Lauren Oakley.Other couples to dance on the tour include 2024 finalists Love Island's Tasha Ghouri and Aljaz Skorjanec, and fellow finalists, actress Sarah Hadland and Vito Coppola. Actor and singer Shayne Ward will also appear, dancing alongside pro Nancy Xu.Professional dancer Michelle Tsiakkas and EastEnders star Jamie Borthwick will dance together while Kai Widdrington and Olympian Montell Douglas are paired, as  are Katya Jones and opera singer Wynne Evans.This year's winner, comedian Chris McCausland, who was the first blind contestant to take part in Strictly, will not appear on the tour due to scheduling conflicts with his stand-up dates.Dancers Dianne Buswell, Karen Hauer, Neil Jones, Nikita Kuzmin, Jowita Przystal, Robbie Kmetoni and Jake Leigh, will also perform.The tour opens at Birmingham's Utilita Arena on 17 January and will visit Sheffield, Newcastle, Glasgow, Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester and Nottingham.The final show will take place in London at the O2 on 9 February.Dancers will be joined by the Strictly judges Shirley Ballas, Anton Du Beke, Craig Revel Horwood and, for the first time on tour, Motsi Mabuse.It Takes Two host Janette Manrara will return to host.Manrara said it was ""an incredible line-up of couples"".""Arena audiences around the country are in for a real treat.

Robbie Williams on why he's played by a chimp in new film17 hrs agoCulture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7r21egd82o,"Robbie Williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo.""I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,"" the singer says.He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig.""I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.""The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man.""Kevin Costner sought me out,"" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: ""He wanted to come and tell me about the movie."" Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two).The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party. Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence.Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman.Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey. For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.""There have been a lot of musical biopics,"" says Gracey. ""I wanted to come at this with a different lens.""Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'.""It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.""And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'""Williams takes up the story: ""I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'""I went, 'Monkey?'""And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'."" The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey.""I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,"" he says. ""And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.""There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.'""And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'"" Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022.""We also scanned his eyes,"" explains Gracey, ""So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.""""I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,"" interrupts Williams.""I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film.""Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic."" Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as ""the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation"".And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion.""My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,"" Williams admits.""She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend."" Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years.In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family.""He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,"" says Williams.""I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man.""But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up."" The film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That.""There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,"" is his summary.""I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.""The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.""It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,"" he says.""It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.""But these plans will have to wait. At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars.Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.)In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric ""Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing"".How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards.And there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination.""Best visual effects,"" starts Gracey, before Williams interjects once more.""Best musical monkey!"" he beams.Gracey laughs. ""If that was a category, we would definitely win.""Hollywood is indeed starting to listen.Better Man opens in cinema on 26 December."

2 hrs agoGrenfell families complain to architect regulatorThe Good Law Project has complained over architects involved in the Grenfell Tower refurbishment.2 hrs agoLondon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx9574ew07o,"The families of three people who died in the Grenfell Tower fire are supporting a letter of complaint to a regulator about the architects involved in the block's refurbishment.The Good Law Project delivered a letter of complaint to the Architects Registration Board (ARB) which accused Studio E of being negligent in its role and said it should be held accountable.Apublic inquiry previously found architectural firm Studio E bore ""a very significant degree of responsibilityfor the disaster"" in 2017, in which 72 people died.The ARB said formal investigations began after phase two of the inquiry concluded, but it did not comment on the details of investigations. Studio E isin the process of being liquidatedand the BBC has attempted to approach representatives for comment.The Good Law Project was joined by the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) on Monday to deliver the letter, and said if the complaint is upheld it hoped to set a precedent enabling other residents of buildings with dangerous cladding to file a complaint against their architects with the ARB.It added the families ofAmna Mahmoud Idris, Amal Ahmedin and three-year-old Amaya Tuccu-Ahmedin, all of whom died on the 19th floor of Grenfell Tower, supported the group's efforts and submitted a statement saying while the architects ""may be held to account today... we, the bereaved families, will have to live with their mistakes for the rest of our lives"". Their statement read: ""These architects were responsible for the architectural safety of our and our families' homes.""Yet none of their partners or employees had the relevant knowledge, experience or skills needed to work on a high-rise cladding project.""They let us and our loved ones down.""The Good Law Project said it also gained support for its letter from the Grenfell Community Campaigners.Bekah Sparrow, legal manager at the Good Law Project, said: ""It's been seven and a half years since the fire and those architects are still on the register, we haven't seen any action from the regulator at all."" ""We're really hoping the registration board takes robust action. In practical terms they can issue a reprimand, fine, suspension - they can even strike architects off the register,"" Ms Sparrow continued.""We've got unsafe cladding up and down the country, so many people living in unsafe buildings and we need them to know, architects to know, that the registration board does take action when there's information in the public domain that seriously questions whether things have gone as they should have done."" Matt Wrack, general secretary at the FBU, said: ""One of the things we've said from day one is that the Grenfell Tower tragedy represents a complete failure of regulation in this country in terms of building safety, and that's at the heart of everything that went wrong.""If anyone reads the findings of the report and the evidence given in the inquiry, there was a complete failure in terms of the planning of that redevelopment, how it was done who was allowed to do it - and that needs to be challenged.""I think the architects are exposed in the evidence that was heard at the inquiry and in the findings of the inquiry as a firm who had no experience or knowledge of that type of work... and they need to be held to account for that, and the regulation of architects needs to be better enforced."" An ARB spokesperson said following phase two of the inquiry, formal investigations began ""into whether any architects involved in the refurbishment of the tower might be guilty of a disciplinary offence under the Architects Code"".""The investigations must be conducted properly if they are to be effective, and can be complex, particularly when they take place in the background of potential criminal proceedings which must not be prejudiced,"" they added.""It is ARB's policy to not comment on the detail of investigations until or unless they reach a public hearing of our professional conduct committee, so that the committee can make an independent decision based on the evidence available.""

Ms Harper said they were ""all amazing bands and we are so thankful to them for playing and so hopefully we will get a few people down to see that"".The venue was ""looking a little bit shabby at the moment"", she said, and the aim was to repair the damage and improve the exterior, for nearby residents and guests, with new signage and planters.""You can see a lot of our cladding and our old windows through it now and it's just getting a bit dangerous and it's actually affecting all our bookings now,"" Ms Harper added.She said some couples who had met at the venue wanted to get married there, but the condition of the building ""puts a lot of people off"".Ms Harper said the ""amazing"" funding from the Veolia Trust would cover a lot of the work but the terms included the venue contributed £10,000 to complete the project.She added it was very important to preserve The Tin, especially as many music venues were being closed nationally.The Tin held many gigs, supported grassroots music and ran projects, including Live on Stage which helped senior school-aged children get into music and try out workshops, Ms Harper explained.""We just need our front to reflect the amazing stuff that goes on inside.""

"4 hrs agoPaddington firm lists in UK to protect British bearThe boss of Canal+ says the bear will stay ""close to his roots"" as the firm begins trading in London.4 hrs agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c390zve2ejzo,"Paddington will not be Americanised for US audiences, the boss of the firm behind the film franchise has pledged.""This is the most British bear… it has appealed to a lot of people because it is authentic,"" said Canal+ chief executive Maxime Saada.The news comes as the the French streaming company, which owns the film rights to the iconic British bear, began trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday.Chancellor Rachel Reeves has described it as a ""vote of confidence"" in the London market, which has struggled to attract new business in recent years. Canal+ is being spun off from the Vivendi media stable, and is reported to be planning further global expansion from its new London base. Mr Saada told the BBC: ""We got some feedback from American companies that Paddington the bear is not American enough.""To maximise the Paddington box office, we could have made an American movie.""But he said the British bear's heritage would be preserved.""This is really our most prized intellectual property... we are very careful about being very close to its roots and authentic.""Canal+ is behind streaming hits such as Versailles and its subsidiary StudioCanal owns the rights to an array of movies including Total Recall, the Shaun the Sheep and Bridget Jones franchises, and more recently the Amy Winehouse biopic, Back to Black, as well as the three films featuring the marmalade-munching bear.The latest Paddington film, released last month, shows the bear and his adopted British family returning to his roots in Peru amid a trail of mishaps.Mr Saada said Paddington 4 was ""certainly not coming tomorrow"" but confirmed that the company is working on a follow-up and an animated series. Canal+ operates in 50 countries and has 27 million subscribers, two thirds of whom are outside of France.The firm's London listing comes after years of concerns over the exchange's lacklustre performance, with companies such as the construction group Ashstead and microchip designer Arm leaving to list overseas. Others have opted to go private.The London Stock Exchange is set for itsworst year for departures since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Some 88 companies have delisted or transferred their primary listing from London's main market, with only 18 taking their place.Economists say a thriving stock market is important for boosting the economy because it helps businesses raise money by allowing them to sell shares.This gives companies the funds they need to borrow and invest in new projects, create jobs, and expand, which in turn drives economic growth.Mr Saada has said the new flexibility in rules for LSE and the UK's strong creative industry played a role persuading him to choose London.""We have suddenly aroused a lot of curiosity from American investors, from British investors, from investors all over the world and we don't think this could have happened by listing anywhere else in the European territory.""""We have a long history of working with the creative industries here in the UK and that's also very important to us.""The flotation is expected to value the firm at up to €6bn (£5bn)."

1 day agoAmbulance dispatcher releases second singleAaron Wilkes released Stand Together in September and The Adventure was released this week.1 day agoStoke & Staffordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dxejyzj9go,"An ambulance worker who wrote and recorded a single in his front room to support male mental health, after he went through a tough time himself, has released his second track.In September, Aaron Wilkes released Stand Together, and his next song, The Adventure, was released this week.The 38-year-old, who has worked as a West Midlands ambulance control room dispatcher for 18 years, surprised his colleagues with his first single after keeping his talent under wraps.He is now forming a band to perform live, but said his music would remain a hobby, because he loves his job. He said he recorded and produced the original song in his front room in Stafford, with a little help from his father.He said he wanted to create a song to boost mental health because of music's ability to change the way we feel and make us think.""Rather than slow and depressing, it was uplifting and powerful,"" he said. ""That was the intent.""People who heard it messaged him directly to say thank you, he added. ""They were complete strangers. What impact it had on them, I don't know. I'm just pleased it did.""It was released on 28 September, ahead of Men's Health Awareness Month in November.He wrote the song to help himself through a tough time and help others as well, he said.It went on to be played on 15 radio stations and has been listened to more than 9,000 times. The Adventure has a Celtic theme with a hint of Christmas, he said.""It's not just a Christmas song though, you can play it all year round,"" he added.""It's not so much about mental health. This is aimed at people setting out on a new adventure, maybe in a relationship, or a new connection, or networks - just to feel on top of the world.""He said while the duet with fellow musician Freya Butlin is about new adventures, he will not be starting a new career.""It's a hobby,"" he said. ""I love working for the ambulance service. I've been there 18 years and I don't intend to change.""Both songs have raised money for charity.A spokeswoman for the ambulance service said: ""Aaron's passion for helping others means that, once more, 100% of the royalties from his new song will go to MAAC (Midlands Air Ambulance Charity) and TASC (The Ambulance Staff Charity).""

"2 days agoBollywood superstar on why he secretly quit filmsAamir Khan had decided to leave the film industry during the pandemic, but is now back and hoping to make history at the Oscars.2 days agoCulture",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70883g2kzno,"Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan is known for some of India's most popular films, including Lagaan and 3 Idiots.So great is his appeal, he can barely walk down the street without getting mobbed by fans.What's less well known is that he secretly quit films during the Covid pandemic in order to spend more time with his loved ones.""I told my family I'm done with acting and films,"" he tells BBC News.""I [didn't] want to produce or direct or act. I just wanted to be with the family.""You'd imagine a major star like Khan deciding to quit the industry would have sent shockwaves through India, a nation that is fully obsessed with films.But, he explains, his decision went unnoticed at the time because so few movies were being made due to the pandemic.""No-one knew about it,"" he says. Fans can breathe a sigh of relief, though.Khan didn't quit for long. And now he's back and is promoting Laapataa Ladies - or Lost Ladies - a film he's produced. It is India's official pick for the Oscars in the best international feature film category.Khan says it was his children who convinced him to go back to work.""They were like, 'But we can't spend 24 hours with you. So get real and get a life.' So they gently nudged me back into the films,"" he says. Can zombies and witches save Bollywood from its troubles?Nostalgic Indians flock to cinemas to watch old hitsAlia Bhatt: The young Bollywood star taking on Hollywood At 59, Khan has worked as an actor, director and producer for three decades.He's known as one of the three ""Khans of Bollywood"" - the others being fellow megastars Shah Rukh and Salman.Known for tackling social issues, Aamir's films are widely acclaimed as well as breaking box office records.He is also no stranger to the Oscars. Lagaan, a film about cricket set in the 19th Century during the British Empire, was nominated for best foreign language film in 2002.Khan is now trying to make history with Laapataa Ladies. If it succeeds, it would be the first Indian film to win the coveted international prize. He will find out whether it has made the shortlist on Tuesday.Khan said he's ""not quite sure how seriously"" to take awards. ""Cinema is so subjective,"" he says.But he admits a win would mean a lot to India. ""I think Indians are so film crazy and we've been dying to win the Academy Award for an Indian film, which hasn't happened till now. So the country will go ballistic. They'll just go mad if we win,"" he says.""So just for the people of our country and for our country, I would be really happy if we win the award.""Set in rural India, Laapataa Ladies tells the story of a young man bringing the wrong bride home. Meanwhile, his wife ends up lost, having to fend for herself.It's a satire looking at the treatment of women, including touching on the sensitive topic of domestic violence.Khan describes the plot as ""a bit Shakespearean"", with its focus on humour and mistaken identities.But, he adds, it's saying ""a lot of important things about women's issues, their independence, their right to decide for themselves what they want to do"".It was these issues that drew him to the film in the first place, he explains.""Every now and then you get an opportunity as a creative person to actually also sensitise people about certain issues that we face in society,"" he says.""Women all over the world have been subjected to a lot of challenges in their lives. Women have a raw deal in life. So I felt that here is a story which really brings that out well in such a nice way, which is why I wanted to produce it."" Khan was also ""very keen"" that his ex-wife, Kiran Rao, should direct the film.The pair, who married in 2005, announced their separation in 2021. But they have remained close, both professionally and personally.""I think the reason I chose Kiran was because I knew that she would be very honest with it and that's what I wanted,"" he says.""We get along really well. We really love each other, we respect each other.""Our relationship may have changed slightly – but that doesn't mean what we feel for each other has gone down or something.""That's not to say it's all been plain sailing, however.Khan admits there were arguments on set.""We can't make a film without an argument. So we argue every point and we have strong opinions,"" he says.""But our sensibilities are very similar. We are not talking about fundamental things. We are just trying to sometimes convince the other person a better way of conveying something."" Bollywood produces hundreds of films every year and has a huge following among Indians globally.The sway the films and stars have on their fans' imagination cannot be overstated.It has had recent success at the Academy Awards, with Naatu Naatu from RRR winning best original song and The Elephant Whisperers awarded best documentary short film.But victory in the international film category has so far eluded it, something Khan attributes to the competition.""India has made really great films over the years. Occasionally it's a matter of the right film not getting sent or the best film not getting sent,"" he says.""But otherwise we have to understand that the films you're competing against - you're not competing against five or six films, you're competing against almost 80 or 90 films, which are the best in the world.""As to whether a Bollywood film could one day scoop the best overall film award, Khan says it is ""possible"".But Indian film-makers would first need to start making movies for a global market, he adds.""I've never really looked at an international audience,"" he says. ""We have such a large audience of our own that it doesn't come in to our mind.""That will only happen when Indians start making films for a world audience. I don't think we have the bandwidth for it right now."" For now, Khan is focusing on a range of projects alongside Laapataa Ladies, which also include his next film Sitaare Zameen Par, due for release in 2025.Looking further out, he's hoping to make one film a year, while his ""dream project"" is to take on Mahabharat - the ancient Indian epic.But since unretiring from film, he is determined to do things differently. Again, this was influenced by his children.""My son said, 'You're an extreme person',"" he says.""He said, 'You're like a pendulum. You only did films, films, films. And now you want to swing to the other side and do no films and be with family, family, family. There is a middle place also you can think about'.""Khan says his son told him to ""try and bring some balance"" into his life.""And I thought he was right. So since then, that's what I've been trying to do - living a balanced life where I'm working really hard, in fact I'm doing much more work that I ever did, but I don't work after 6 o'clock any more.""Khan says he has also started therapy in recent years, inspired by his daughter Ira, who works in mental health.""I think that's something that's really helped me. That's really helped me understand myself better.""I'm actually finding that balance between work and a personal life. So I feel that I've reached that space now.""Watch Aamir Khan: The Interview on the BBC News Channel and BBC iPlayer."
"Nato must switch to a wartime mindset, warns secretary generalMark Rutte urged members to ""turbocharge"" their defence spending to prevent future war with Russia.4 days agoEurope",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly41x7eg71o,"The head of Nato has said it is time to ""shift to a wartime mindset"", as he warned the military alliance's members were not spending enough to prepare for the threat of a future conflict with Russia.Secretary general Mark Rutte said Moscow was ""preparing for long-term confrontation with Ukraine and with us"", describing the current security situation as the worst in his lifetime.""We are not ready for what is coming our way in four to five years,"" he said in his first major speech since becoming secretary general in October, urging members to ""turbocharge"" their defence spending.His comments come weeks before president-elect Donald Trump takes office, havingpreviously suggestedthe US would not protect Nato allies that were failing to spend enough on defence. Nato members have pledged to spend at least 2% of the value of their economies - measured by GDP - on defence per year by 2024.But speaking at an event in Brussels, the former Dutch prime minister said ""a lot more"" would be needed as danger ""[moves] towards us at full speed"".He said European members had spent upwards of 3% of GDP on defence during the Cold War.""If we don't spend more together now to prevent war, we will pay a much, much, much higher price later to fight it,"" he said.He added that Russia's economy was ""on a war footing"", with its defence spend by 2025 set to be ""a third of Russia's state budget – and the highest level since the Cold War"".Russia has significantly increased its defence spending since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with record levels approved for 2025.Rutte spoke ata critical juncture in the war in Ukraine,with Russian forces grinding forward in the east of the country. By November, Moscow had seized six times as much Ukrainian territory in 2024compared with the whole of 2023.While the average defence spend for Nato members in Europe and Canada is estimated at 2%, not all meet the target.Trump said in February that he would""encourage"" Russia to attack any Nato member that fails to pay its billsas part of the Western military alliance.Nato's 32 members in Europe and North America agree that if one member is attacked, the others should help defend them. Speaking to the BBC following his speech on Thursday, Rutte said: ""Donald Trump was completely right when in his first term he forced us to spend more, he was successful, we are considerably spending more than before he became president, so in that sense he was totally right.""This is why some in Nato call Rutte ""The Trump Whisperer"". And that, they say, is a very big reason he was chosen as Nato secretary general.Back in 2018, then President Trump famously threatened the US would ""go our own way"" if other Nato members - essentially in Europe - did not spend more on their own militaries. Then Dutch Prime Minister Rutte was credited with reasoning with the US president, assuring him that spending had already gone up and that he, President Trump, was the reason for it.And now Trump is poised to return to the White House and Rutte wants to keep the US committed to Nato and European defence. So Rutte's messaging to Trump is once again to flatter him.As a former prime minister, Rutte well knows that Europe's leaders hesitate to spend much more on defence because voters across the continent have other priorities - rising living costs, health, migration.That, he told the BBC, is why he aimed his speech today as his ""plea"" to ""people"".""I'm really pleading directly to the one billion people living in Nato territory, and particularly in Canada and Europe, to ask them to help me,"" Rutte said.""Call up your politicians, tell them that you agree that yes it is difficult, it will mean somewhat less spending on some other items, but that you want them, your politicians, to prioritise defence, because this is long-term crucial…""My plea here is if you have children, grandchildren, if you think our way of life should be preserved, the democracy, our values, then we have to prioritise defence.""And if we don't, in four or five years we are in real difficulty."""
Russia launches huge attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructureThe Kremlin says the strikes were in response to Kyiv using US-made missiles to attack its territory.3 days agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0xw05k7z1o,"Russia has launched a huge attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which authorities said was the 12th large-scale attack on energy facilities this year.Ninety-three missiles and more than 200 drones were used - but 81 of the missiles were shot down, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.The strikes targeted sites in western Ukraine, damaging energy facilities in several regions, some seriously. Authorities in Ivano-Frankivsk said it was the worst attack on the region so far.Moscow said the attack was in response to a Ukrainian strike on a military airbase in south-west Russia using US-made missiles. In an interview with Time magazine on Thursday,to mark being named Person of the Year, US President-elect Donald Trump said he disagreed ""very vehemently"" with American-made missiles targeting sites in Russia and branded it ""crazy"".""We're just escalating this war and making it worse,"" he said.On Friday, the Kremlin said that Trump's comments were ""fully aligned"" with Moscow's position.""That impresses us,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""It is obvious that Trump understands exactly what is escalating the situation.""Trump also told Time he wanted to reach an agreement to end the war, and the only way to do that was ""not to abandon"". Last month, US President Joe Biden allowed Ukraine to use US-made ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia.The first attacks using the long-range missiles occurred the following day, with Russian authoritiesstating at the time that the Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine, had been hit.Kyiv had been using ATACMS missilessince October 2023, but only on Russian-held targets within Ukrainian territory. Russia's attacks came on the coldest day of the Ukrainian winter so far, with temperatures around -6C.Along with the damage caused in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, energy and infrastructure facilities were damaged in the Lviv and Ternopil regions.No critical or residential infrastructure was hit in the Kyiv region, according to Ruslan Kravchenko, the area's governor.Five out of the country's nine operating nuclear reactor units have been operating with reduced power.As a result of the attack, the Ukrenergo National Power Company had to increase power supply restrictions on Friday, with rolling blackouts being introduced in all regions.Ukrenergo added that during the day on Friday, electricity would be imported from Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In total, Russia has captured and retaken about 2,350 sq km of territory (907 sq miles) in eastern Ukraine and in Russia's western Kursk region."
The woman helping amputees rebuild their lives in war-torn UkraineOlga Rudnieva is supporting Ukrainian soldiers who have lost limbs in the front line to return from injury even stronger.6 days agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q0wvyqzwdo,"Serhiy Petchenko lost both hands while defending Ukraine from Russian invaders in June 2023.After surviving the bitter months-long battle for the city of Bakhmut, his injury came in a railway incident further from the front line.It left the 42-year-old feeling helpless and in despair. After the amputations, his wife, Anna, had to remain by his side 24/7 for six months.""What helped us survive is our love,"" says Serhiy.But it's hard to believe he went through such an ordeal when you see him now, standing on the doorstep of a brand-new café, which he is about to open in Lviv, in the west of Ukraine.He smiles widely, his arms - and hands - by his side.Serhiy received two prosthetic hands and full rehabilitation at the Superhumans Center, a private clinic for people with war injuries, located outside the city.At the same time, the couple received the training they needed to open a family business.Serhiy says the centre gave him a chance to return normal life, while learning to live with a new disability. At least 50,000 Ukrainians have lost limbs in nearly three years of war according to the Ukrainian Health Ministry - both soldiers and civilians.""Some people have double, triple, quadruple amputations. All these people will need prosthetics, or some will use wheelchairs,"" says Olga Rudnieva, CEO and co-founder of the Superhumans Center.Many amputations are the result of delays in evacuation from the battlefield. The barrage of incoming fire can be so intense that it may take many hours to get a wounded soldier to hospital.With more than one million people on the front line, Rudnieva says, Ukraine will become ""the country of people with disabilities"".""We want to normalise disability. OK, that's how the country is going to look,"" she says, describing the thinking behind her centre.""Most of the people here at the centre shouldn't be alive. The fact that they are is a miracle in itself."" Rudnieva co-founded the centre amid the Russian missile attacks that have rained down on the country since February 2022. Some people called her ""crazy"" but she went ahead anyway.""If I have an opinion, I'm sharing my opinion. If I know what to do, I just go and do it,"" she says.Her partners and team raised funds all over the world for high-quality prosthetics and reconstructive surgery. Her passionate presentation, explaining how injuries can be empowering, turned some celebrities into Superhumans supporters, including British adventurer Bear Grylls, Virgin boss Richard Branson, singer Sting and actress Trudie Styler.""We truly believe that you can be empowered by trauma. The trauma can ruin you or it can build your superpower,"" she says.The Superhumans Center supplements Ukraine's military hospitals and clinics, which are overloaded with the constant flow of wounded soldiers from the 3,200km long front line.Since it opened in April 2023, more than 1,000 patients have received treatment here - both military and civilian, adults and children. Almost 800 of them have received prosthetic limbs.""It's the global headquarters of resilience,"" says 47-year-old Rudnieva. walking energetically between patients' wheelchairs.

She lost her leg in a Russian rocket strike on the way to her mum's birthday party. ""The first thing I'll do when I have my artificial leg, if the weather is fine, is just go for a walk. Without any rush, without an aim. I'll just take a walk to recall how it feels,"" she says.At present she uses a leg that belongs to the rehabilitation room, but soon she will have one of her own.Rudnieva remembers Olena's story in detail, and the stories of her other patients.She knows about their wives and husbands, parents and pre-war jobs. ""Younger guys bring me their girlfriends and ask my opinion,"" she says, with a smile.Couples have even come came to her before taking a decision on whether to divorce or not.A severe war injury is a challenge not just for the survivor, but for his or her entire family, and it tests relationships.Showing the newly equipped children's room, Rudnieva smiles.""We are waiting today for Nazarchyk, Serhiy and Anna's son. He is so active. He will turn it upside down.""Rudnieva says that her work has taught her to value life as never before, and also to stop fearing death. Once a director of the Olena Pinchuk Foundation, working to halt the spread of HIV/Aids across Ukraine, she was abroad when Russia invaded. For a few months she ran a humanitarian aid hub in Poland, then she returned to Ukraine and founded her life-changing project.She wasn't the only one. Ukrainian civil society quickly rallied round, both to support the war effort - fundraising for drones and vehicles, importing medical equipment or clothing - and to keep society going while the country fought for its life.There are now other private rehabilitation centres, ambulances and taxis that help evacuate people from half-destroyed towns, food services for refugees, and many other initiatives that supplement services provided by the state.And women have played a key role.""When the full-scale invasion started, I, as a feminist, was very scared. I thought that it's the end of feminism, because war is a very masculine thing,"" Rudnieva says.But later on she realised that women have taken over many responsibilities as men have gone away to fight, as well as in some cases becoming fighters too.""I think that women proved to be absolutely amazing during this war,"" says Rudnieva, as some of her words are drowned out by sirens - part of the soundtrack of Ukraine's new life.

Prison boss killed in car blast in occupied UkraineSergei Yevsyukov's death is being seen as the latest in a series of attacks on Russian officers.7 days agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y867penn8o,"The former head of a notorious prison in Russian-occupied Ukraine has reportedly been killed in a car blast in Donetsk, in what is being seen as the latest in a series of attacks on pro-Kremlin figures in occupied land.Ukrainian media say that Sergei Yevsyukov, 49, was killed in a blast from an explosive device planted under his car, with one outlet reporting that the bomb was equivalent to about 100g of TNT.Yevsyukov was chief of the Olenivka Prison when dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of wardied in a missile strike in July 2022.Russia blamed Ukraine for that attack but Ukraine said Russia had targeted the prison to destroy evidence of torture and other war crimes committed there. On Monday, Russian authorities said they had opened a criminal investigation into the incident which took place near the city's centre.They did not confirm identities but said two local residents had been injured.Ukrainian bloggers reported Yevsyukov's wife had also been injured in the attack, losing a leg, and was in hospital on a critical condition.""[We] are conducting a detailed examination of the scene of the incident and a set of operational and investigative measures,"" the Russian Investigations Committee said.Footage of the scene shows the burnt-out white SUV parked on a main street in Donestsk.Yevsyukov's killing is being seen as the latest in a string of targeted attacks by Ukraine on Russian officers, Russian-installed military officials and pro-Kremlin public figures in occupied Ukrainian territory and in Russia.In November, a senior naval officer Valery Trankovsky who had been accused of war crimes by Ukraine was killed in Crimea. Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.Trankovsky's assassination was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence, AFP news agency reported last month citing a source in Ukraine's security services.In October, Ukraine claimed responsibility for a car bomb attack that killed an official at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.And in April, a car bomb in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region killed a Moscow-appointed government official.Donetsk city and parts of the wider region in eastern Ukraine were first seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014, and the area has been partially controlled by Moscow ever since.The region has consistently seen some of the fiercest fighting of the war these past nearly three years."
Artists imagine a new utopia for Kenya's capitalCreatives in Nairobi unleash their imaginations in an effort to inspire a new future for the city.30 Nov 2024Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4vk5y4ng5o,"Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, has long been known as “the green city in the sun” because of its mix of forest and grasslands among the urban sprawl, but it all depends on where you are viewing it from.Seen from one of the city’s comfortable apartment blocks or homes, then yes, perhaps – from one of its densely packed slums, then no.There, life can be characterised by poverty and ecological disaster, such as flooding and deadly landslides.But an art collective - Kairos Futura – has been trying to take what might seem like some of the city’s more dystopian elements and create a vision of a utopia, or at least how that might be achieved.Their exhibition Hakuna Utopia features the works of seven artists exploring themes of apocalypse and resilience – some in quite abstract ways - as they respond to the daily challenges endured by Nairobi’s six million residents. One of the collective, Stoneface Bombaa, grew up in Mathare, the capital’s second-largest informal settlement.He has overcome great odds to become an artist and wants to use his work to address the way that people in Mathare live – often lacking jobs, housing and education.Bombaa says they endure a “hand-to-mouth economy”, never sure where their next meal will come from.“People are really angry,” he says, but through art, he feels he can “channel” his community’s anger into something positive as “art unites”.Bombaa set out to create from the exhibitions “micro-utopia” sites dotted around the city.He called it the “jungle room” and hoped to get people to connect with nature from within Mathare itself, in an attempt to bridge the ecological divide.Ironically, the building he had identified as a possible site was demolished by the authorities to make way for a road. Undeterred, he has been taking children from his community, often stuck living in unimaginable urban squalor, to experience Nairobi’s verdant parks and expose them to green spaces.“There are no trees or green spaces in Mathare,” Bombaa says.But by contemplating the idea of utopia, he believes that he can imagine what it would be like if people in his community actually had unrestricted access to the city’s green spaces.In this way, people in his community can claim a right to access nature that is denied to them simply because they are poor. Bombaa also complains about how ordinary Nairobians, often scrabbling to make a living, have to pay to enter some of their city’s most beautiful locations such as the arboretum or Karura forest.The Kairos Futura team are also drawing inspiration from nature to use their imagination in how to address urgent environmental issues.For example, Coltrane McDowell has applied this to architecture.In his work Invisible Cities, he was inspired by termite mounds to reimagine what architecture might look like in the future. Another artist in the show, Abdul Rop, known for his mesmerising woodcut prints and paintings, says that in order to “achieve utopia”, Nairobians need to work together.“That's why the young people are agitating right now for change,” he says, suggesting they are frustrated by a corrupt political system that hems in their potential.Gen Z were at the forefront of proteststhis year against new tax measures, which saw the government make an embarrassing U-turn.Rop argues that by thinking about utopia through the lens of art, young people may find creative ways to fight for their future.Rather than being far-fetched, he thinks that it can help imagine a bolder and more equal future for his city.“The moment to act for the future is now,” he says.

Ewan McGregor takes on first UK theatre role in 17 yearsThe star will appear in My Master Builder in London's West End next year.See more,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3we671xvpqo,"Ewan McGregor has described live theatre as ""good for the soul"", as he announced he is to return to the London stage for the first time in 17 years.The Scottish actor, who has starred in Trainspotting and Moulin Rouge, is set to star in My Master Builder in London's West End between April and July next year.McGregor told BBC News: ""This is the longest I haven’t been on stage, and in honesty, I’ve missed it.""Inspired by Henrik Ibsen's 1892 play The Master Builder, the new show is written by US playwright Lila Raicek and will be directed by Michael Grandage. ""The funny story is, I had literally just finished reading Ibsen’s The Master Builder for pleasure – an extraordinary read,"" McGregor explained. ""Michael got in touch out of the blue and I mentioned how much I’d love to get back on stage.""And in a moment of pure coincidence, he told me he had a play inspired by The Master Builder sitting on his desk. I asked him to send it to me, and here we are. A moment of total serendipity.""He said Raicek had taken the script in a ""fascinating"" direction, describing the new play as a ""very modern take on sexual politics in a way that resonates particularly for this moment we find ourselves in"".""It examines these issues in a very grown-up way,"" he continued. ""And ultimately, I felt like what a great play it would be to see, and therefore what a great play it would be to do."" Ibsen's The Master Builder focused on a middle-aged Norwegian architect who becomes successful by building new homes following a fire that destroys a residential estate.But the ambitious and ruthless architect, Halvard Solness, grapples with feelings of inadequacy and fear of being overtaken by younger talent.The production will begin previews at the Wyndham's Theatre in London on 17 April, and run until 12 July.Grandage and McGregor have previously collaborated on Othello and Guys and Dolls, both for the Donmar theatre, where Grandage was artistic director.McGregor described working on the two shows as ""amazing experiences"", adding he felt ""incredibly safe"" in the director's hands.""I really like the work he gets out of me,"" McGregor said. ""He has great creative intention and ideas before we start in the rehearsal room, but when we are actually rehearsing with him, there’s such a great sense of discovering it together."" McGregor's film credits include Brassed Off, Miss Potter, Black Hawk Down, Angels & Demons, Birds of Prey and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.He played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the first of the Star Wars prequel trilogy Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace in 1999. He revisited the role in subsequent Star Wars films and in the 2022 miniseries Obi-Wan Kenobi.The 53-year-old's other TV credits include Halston, in which he played fashion designer Roy Halston Frowick. McGregor won an Emmy Award in 2021 for his portrayal.His last stage appearance was more than a decade ago, when he appeared in The Real Thing on Broadway, opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal.Reflecting on his return to live theatre, McGregor said: ""I love acting on film and television, and of course, I love acting on stage. I have always been lucky enough to do all three throughout my career.""Theatre teaches you so much about acting, the audience teaches you. What works, what doesn’t. It’s very good for the soul. The live experience. The power of storytelling.""Also I love the routine of it, waking up in the morning with the day aiming towards this event, this electric experience.""Earlier this year, McGregor received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. He said he was ""particularly moved"" his star had been placed beside that of the movie franchise's original Princess Leia, the late actress Carrie Fisher."

""I feel like I've come home.""He added that since he was last in the building, it felt like it had ""got a new lease of life and a burst of energy"". Golding had been prepared to spend his 10th year in the St Albans pantomime when Covid hit and the run of Mother Goose in December 2020 was scrapped.He moved to Northamptonshire and in 2021, performed in Northampton's Royal and Derngate pantomime instead, where he played the dame for three years.At that time, and with a two-year-old daughter, to be working 10 minutes from where he lived was a ""no-brainer"" but now she is older, he has returned to the Arena.""Don't get me wrong, I loved the three years I've been in Northampton, it's been fantastic and it's a wonderful theatre but to come back to St Albans really feels like sitting in an old comfy chair again,"" he said. This year, Golding, who played comedy great Eric Morecambe in the award-winning play Morecambe,returned to the characterin Paul Hendy's The Last Laugh, which had a successful Edinburgh run and will embark on a national tour in 2025.But before that he will be one of the Ugly Sisters, alongside his best friend, Ian Kirkby, in Cinderella, which he said is ""the greatest of all the pantomimes"".""To be here, back in the old building again it's like nothing's changed but everything has changed,"" he said.""We've even got a working sink in the dressing room now."" Throughout his sojourn in Northamptonshire, Golding remained a patron of the venue, a role he has held since 2018, when he organised its 50th anniversary gala, but which he said had been ""slightly dormant"" since the pandemic.""I had lots of things planned and it was very exciting but then Covid happened and it kind of put the kibosh on anything that we were going to do to get more attention to the arts locally for the people of St Albans,"" he said.Now he is back he said he fully intended to ""take on my patron duties whatever they may be in the future"" and represent the venue on an artistic level. It has been a tricky few years for the Arena, with the pandemic in 2020 and thediscovery of asbestos in December 2021which led to its pantomime closing early and the postponement of all shows for about four months.There has also been discussion aboutreplacing it with a new entertainment space.But Golding is championing the theatre, which is now under new management and ""looking great"", he said.""I'm fighting it's corner,"" he said. ""There's been a big shake up and it's got a very nice, exciting fresh new feel about it, it's a bit of a renaissance moment.""It's had a few licks of paint and it just feels like it's got a new lease of life and a burst of energy.""This old building, I've always said, is probably one of the ugliest buildings in the city but with the biggest heart so it's nice to see some love going back into it again and hopefully we can continue to bring some more joy to the people of the area.""I'd love to be here again... so we'll see what happens next year.""

1 day agoColourful life of 100-year-old artist who's never used a paint brushShe will shortly turn 101 but still paints in her studio at her Swansea home every day.1 day agoWales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dq95d29jyo,"Acclaimed artist Glenys Cour is just weeks away from her 101st birthday and cannot believe her good fortune.She has built her long and vibrant life around her passion for colour, met the love of her life along the way and even counted the great Welsh poet Dylan Thomas as a friend.She is still painting every day at her home in Mumbles overlooking Swansea Bay.Glenys has never used a paint brush, instead preferring the ""immediacy"" of working oil paint with torn pieces of fabric and her fingers. ""It's exciting, it's terribly exciting, I love it,"" she said.""Colour is the most important thing, certainly in my work as well as in my life.""She said her career as a painter, printmaker, collage and stained-glass artist and teacher meant she mixed with the ""intelligentsia of Swansea"".As well as Dylan Thomas, who she fondly recalls as a ""really naughty boy"",  her social circle included composer Dan Jones, poet Vernon Watkins, painter Ceri Richards and sculptor Ranald Cour who she would go on to marry.This ""pretty hectic"" social life she enjoyed as an adult could not be further from the experience of her childhood years.Born in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, in 1924, the then Glenys Carthew was an only child and the daughter of a colliery manager.Her father's job meant the family moved around the south Wales valleys seven times in total, living in a series of manager's houses set apart from the workers. During theDepressionof the 1930s, the disparity between her relatively comfortable existence and that of the workers and their families left her isolated from other children.""The circumstances of my father being a manager in a colliery meant you didn't make friends,"" she said.She recalled walking behind some terraced houses and hearing a group of children playing and pretending to be her.""They were playing school and I heard them say 'now I'm Glenys Carthew',"" she said.""And I realised I was posh, I didn't know... it was shattering actually."" But at home, her imagination was fuelled by the books her father would read to her and she began making up her own fairy stories that she would tell to her classmates.""When I think of it now I must have been very odd,"" she laughed.She would also spend hours drawing on paper her father would bring home from work and discovered a passion for creating new colours with watercolour paints.Becoming an artist was ""inevitable"", she said, and she flourished at Cardiff School of Art, where she was taught by celebrated painter Ceri Richards.Richards is regarded asone of the most important British artists of the 20th Century.""He opened my eyes, he was wonderful, he taught me how to see,"" she said. After college, she took a teaching position in Fishguard, living with her grandmother and aunt, but it wasn't long before she moved to Swansea to take a  job as an art teacher at Glanmor Girls School.She began attending an evening classes in life drawing at Swansea College of Art, and it was here she met her husband, the sculptor Ronald Cour, who was lecturing there.She was lovestruck the moment she met him.""The funny thing that stood out was the fact he had beautiful hands and anyway, I fancied him,"" she said with a glint in her eye.She decided to hide in the ladies' toilets so she could speak to him as he left the building at the end of the day. ""I waited until he came level with the door and I opened the door and bumped into him,"" she laughed.""We walked down the stairs together and he said to me 'would you like to come for a drink?'.""They headed to the now demolished Bush Hotel on Swansea's High Street.It was to be her first time in the pub and also the first time she met Dylan Thomas, a schoolfriend of her new beau.""I discovered the best place to meet people when you didn't know anybody was the pub,"" she said.""I met all the intelligentsia of Swansea really."" At the age of 25, she married Ronald, who was 10 years her senior.""We had a pretty hectic social life, a wonderful social life, it was a rich social life, music, theatre, everything,"" she said.""I loved it all, I was so lucky and I adored my husband.""He was always over my shoulder telling me I was wonderful.""The couple had a daughter, Jane, and both their careers went from strength to strength.But in May 1978, Glenys' world was torn apart when Ronald died suddenly and unexpectedly, aged just 63.""I didn't think I could live,"" she said.""Honestly, I really thought I couldn't live without him."" She took a week off work and then threw herself into painting.""I don't think I'd have got through it if I hadn't,"" she said.""I immersed myself in it.""I go through that door and forget everything.""Almost five decades on, Ronald remains a huge part of her life and she confessed she still speaks to him.Her living room is adorned with black and white photos of him and his sculptures. After losing Ronald, she entered a period of vital creativity and spent three decades teaching at Swansea College of Art.""I love people and I love teaching,"" she said.""To be standing up in front of a group of students and trying to open their eyes, there's nothing more thrilling than that.""Today her artworks have found their way into numerous private and public collections and she has been exhibited widely in Europe and the US.In 2014, a major retrospective of her work was held at Swansea's Glynn Vivian Art Gallery. To what does she attribute her longevity?""I think it's the fact that I'm working, I'm sure of it, it's a necessity,"" she said.""I could never get over my good luck for the whole of my life, I've been blessed.""I've had a fantastic life. I really, really mean it."""
"2 days ago'Theatre should be accessible to all'Heartstopper actor Bradley Riches champions accessible performances at the Aylesbury Waterside.2 days agoBeds, Herts & Bucks",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rj550x7pyo,"Seeing actor Bradley Riches flying high above the audience at Buckinghamshire's Aylesbury Waterside Theatre as Peter Pan, belting out numbers such as A Sky Full of Stars, audiences might be surprised to learn that until he was 10, he was non-verbal.Now, the 23-year-old is a passionate advocate for neurodivergent awareness, especially during the sensory overload of panto season.After Riches' autism diagnosis at the age of nine, he started going to an after-school theatre club where he grew up in Surrey.""When I first joined the group, I didn't use words as a form of communication so I was just there pushing myself out of my comfort zone and being around people who couldn't stop singing,"" he said. He added that he ""found his voice"" by playing characters such as Fizzy in Bugsy Malone.""Watching American TV shows, I was able to impersonate the voice,"" he said.""I had a stammer because I'd never used that muscle before, but I was able to use characters to be like an extension of myself and then this art taught me how to weave that into me, and start speaking as Bradley as well.""Doing a musical theatre degree at Hertfordshire drama school, the Emil Dale Academy, he wrote his dissertation on the challenges for neurodivergent performers, which he said started with auditions.""Some directors don't want to give you a lot [in advance] in order to see what you come with, but that's not helpful for neurodiverse people,"" he said.""You need to know what you're doing, you need to get your brain around it... you just want to see what the room looks like and who you're meeting.""Little things like that could be so easily managed, it's not like we're asking to change the world, it's just asking to put different things in place to make things more accessible for everyone."" Other challenges include the industry's unpredictability, finding a routine when not working, and sensory aspects like being in a busy rehearsal room.""I think slowly once you understand the industry and get used to it you start understanding how you can cope with it,"" he said.Since graduating in 2023, Riches has appeared on the London stage in new musical Babies, in Netflix's LGBTQ drama Heartstopper and ITV's Celebrity Big Brother.Peter Pan is his panto debut which brings another level of unpredictability.""I'm shocked that I am excited for it but I think it's just because it's such a positive experience,"" he said.""Everyone has got each other's back, no one wants anything to go wrong and, obviously with time, with different interactions, you know your way out of it. There are worst-case scenario exits."" Riches' neurodivergence also helps him understand the needs of anyone who finds visiting a theatre daunting.He said it was important to have relaxed performances where house lights were left low and strobe lighting and loud noises or explosions may be removed, and is championing the Waterside's efforts to make theatre inclusive for everyone.""I think the main thing that a lot of people feel is of being judged, especially if anything becomes too much,"" he said.""With relaxed performances there's no judgement, anyone can get up from their seat, you can be as loud or as quiet as you want, you can leave and there's a calm room.""There aresigned, captioned and audio described performancesas well, all these are so crucial because everyone should enjoy the panto magic and it makes everyone feel included.""The Waterside also has sensory bags for any performance which include ear defenders, fidget toys, puzzles, and communication cards and this year sign language has been integrated into one of the panto songs for the first time.Theatre director Grant Brisland said theatre leaders ""must have the mindset of removing barriers and establishing initiatives to broaden access for all"".""Bradley's been an inspiration and catalyst for us to unlock more conversations about what we can do to support our neurodiverse community,"" he said.""Whilst we have a lot more to do, we're headed in the right direction.""

We've been very nervous for the last few weeks because the council had gone quiet on the communications front.""But we were hopeful, and campaigned intensely. You can't put it into words. The campaign has really invigorated the borough and shown the council that people can't be pushed around.""I think there is no better news."" The Beck Theatre is expected to move over to the control of Parkwood Theatres in mid-January.Council leader Ian Edwards said they aimed to maintain the theatre while delivering value for money for residents.Tony Doherty, managing director of Parkwood Theatres, said he was ""delighted"" to be securing a long-term future for the theatre while ""bringing fresh and exciting opportunities to the stage"" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

FBI informant who lied about Biden 'bribes' pleads guiltyAlexander Smirnov will likely spend four to six years in prison for making up a story which sparked impeachment hearings.32 mins agoWorld,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnl7qdvjno,"A former informant has pleaded guilty to lying to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about a fake bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Alexander Smirnov, 44, also admitted tax evasion after not reporting more than $2m (£1.58m) in income.His claims became the basis of an impeachment investigation in Congress which centred around the false claims that the Bidens made millions in bribes from Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.But Smirnov admitted he made the story up, and pleaded guilty in Los Angeles on Monday as part of an agreement with prosecutors. Smirnov, a dual US-Israeli citizen, had been an FBI informant for more than a decade when he made the allegations about the Bidens in June 2020, saying that Joe and Hunter Biden each received $5m from the energy company.Prosecutors said Smirnov was motivated by ""bias"" against President Biden and that he spun his ""routine and unextraordinary business contacts"" with Burisma into tales about bribery that were ""fabrications"".The FBI investigated his statements but within months recommended the case be closed without any legal action taken against the Bidens.But the allegations refused to die, and became the basis for a Republican-led drive to investigate President Biden, including an effort to make Smirnov's initial statement public.Prosecutors say that when he was re-interviewed by FBI agents in September 2023, Smirnov doubled down on his claims.Smirnov was arrested in Nevada as he returned to the US from an overseas trip in February 2024.Alexander Smirnov: FBI source accused of Biden lies 'linked to Russian intelligence'According to court documents, he had ties with Russian intelligence and used his more than $2m in unreported income to buy a Las Vegas condominium, a lease on a Bentley car, and hundreds of thousands of dollars of clothes, jewellery and accessories.The case was brought by Special Counsel David Weiss - who has overseen  an investigation of Hunter Biden.Joe Biden issued a pardon for his son, who faced potential prison time for tax evasion and lying on a form about his drug addiction when he bought a gun.Smirnov will be sentenced in January. The plea agreement is subject to approval by a federal judge.He faces a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison and a $1m fine, however prosecutors and defence lawyers have agreed to a sentence of between four and six years and a restitution payment of $675,502, according to the plea deal.The BBC contacted Smirnov's lawyers for comment."
Drone detection system deployed to New York after mystery sightingsThe state governor has asked for more federal support as questions grow over objects spotted in the skies.6 hrs agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvnjp30pplo,"US officials are sending a drone detection system to New York, Governor Kathy Hochul says, after questions over mysterious objects in the skies over the east coast and beyond grew in recent days.Hochul requested the federal assistance after drone sightings forced runways at Stewart International Airport in the state to shut for an hour last week.""In response to my calls for additional resources, our federal partners are sending a drone detection system to New York,"" Hochul wrote on X on Sunday.She said state governments needed more power to deal on their own with the small, uncrewed aircraft that have also been reported in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Massachusetts. And further west, in Ohio, drone sightings also led to the closure of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for about an hour on Friday night, according to local media.""Congress must pass a law that will give us the power to deal directly with the drones,"" Hochul said in her post, after last week promising to ""do whatever it takes to ensure New Yorkers remain safe"".Senator Chuck Schumer said on Sunday he hoped to pass a bill that would give local enforcement more power to investigate unidentified flying objects, saying: ""I'm pushing for answers amid these drone sightings"".He also asked that a drone detection system similar to the one headed for New York also be sent to New Jersey, where most of the aerial encounters have so far been recorded.New Jersey Senator Andy Kim said he went out with local residents over the weekend to observe the night sky, and that he believed - based on conversations with civilian pilots and flight tracking data - that most of the aircraft he saw ""were almost certainly planes"". What we know about mysterious US drone sightingsTwo arrested after 'hazardous drone operation' near Boston airport Despite their demands for more help in dealing with the issue, Hochul and other officials have sought to reassure the public that the suspected drones do not pose a national security threat.On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed the sightings included drones, as well as manned aircraft commonly mistaken for drones. He told ABC News that he knew of ""no foreign involvement"" related to the sightings.The Pentagon has denied the suggestion of one New Jersey representative that the possible drones were coming from an Iranian ""mothership"" lurking off the east coast, while an FBI official has said there may have been ""a slight overreaction"" on the topic.According to Mayorkas, the uptick in drone reports may be due to a change in federal regulations allowing drones to be flown at night.He added that the federal government was working in ""close co-ordination"" with state and local authorities on the issue, saying it was ""critical"" they be given the ability to counter drone activity under federal supervision. With just over a month to go until Donald Trump's inauguration, the president-elect's pick for national security adviser, Republican Representative Mike Waltz, hit out against the Biden administration's response to the sightings.""I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from,"" he told the BBC's US news partner CBS.""We need to get to the bottom of it,"" he said, accusing government agencies of ""pointing at each other"" rather than offering answers.Kim, a Democrat, also called on federal authorities to do more to assuage Americans' concerns.""People have a lot anxiety right now about the economy, health, security etc,"" he wrote on X.""And too often we find that those charged with working on these issues don't engage the public with the respect and depth needed."""
"A decade since Canada opened its doors, Syrians reflect on home away from homeSyrians in Canada reflect on a decade in the country1 day agoWorld",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kev3k49gwo,"It started with just a small group gathered in Mississauga's Celebration Square, rejoicingthat 10,000 km (6,200 miles) away, the Syrian city of Homs had fallen to rebel forces.But when news broke that President Bashar al-Assad had fled the country, putting an end to the country's civil war, this town square in a small Canadian city became flooded with people celebrating,many of whom had fled Assad's regime for Canada just a decade ago.""I was crying for more than 45 minutes,"" said Khaled Abdulwahed, a 31-year-old Syrian who resettled in Toronto when he was just a young man and helped organise Sunday's impromptu event.Now a Canadian citizen, Mr Abdulwahed - who was 17 when he first participated in anti-government protests in Syria - has continued to advocate for the human-rights of his country, which has earned him the title of the ""Syrian mayor of Toronto"".While many have begun to plan trips to see family and friends, they have also shared how Canada will, for most of them, remain home.""Right now, is our turn to help our people, to rebuild our country and to support them from here,"" he said. Mr Abdulwahed was part of a wave of Syrian refugees who came to Canada between 2015-2016, backed by a campaign promise from newly elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to help resettle 25,000 Syrians at a time when many were dying trying to flee their country.Canada's warm welcome stood in sharp contrast to their neighbour's to the south, where Donald Trump was running his first presidential campaign on a promise to ban Muslims from entering the country. He would later try toban immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.Like Mr Abdulwahed, Muzna Dureid was forced to make the journey to Canada by herself when she was a young woman.Within the first three months of the revolution, the then-21-year-old witnessed her brother's arrest, her social media accounts hacked by Assad intelligence officers and an uncle's assassination for his pro-democracy activities.""This was the tipping point,"" she said on a call from her older brother's new home in Spain. He was released a year after the arrest, but the family had by that point fled Damascus and spread out across the world.While Ms Dureid's parents stayed in Saudi Arabia, she managed to secure a fellowship in Turkey before landing another one in 2016 to study in Montreal.A call-out on Facebook for a couch to stay on soon transformed into a lifelong bond. The Quebec family who put her up for that first night - and continued to for that first year - would later go on to privately-sponsor the rest of her family to join her in Canada. Since 1979, Canadians have helped resettleover 390,000 refugeesthrough private sponsorship - which differs from government-assisted programmes as the cost of resettlement is borne by an individual or group.As Canada raced to resettle Syrians fleeing the war, it proved to be essential in meeting that goal; nearly half arrived through some form of private sponsorship, according to theGovernment of Canada.Canada's has gone on to resettlemore than 100,000 Syrians,all through a mixture of government-assisted and private sponsorships.It is a small number compared to how many refugees countries around Syria - namely Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan - took in since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. But their warm welcome in Canada has helped make them feel like an integral part of their new community, Ms Dureid said.""This is why people believe they belong to this country, not for a temporary period, but that this is their country,"" she said.The human-rights activist and policy advisor, who has worked with Canada's ministry for gender equality, says that now that Assad is gone, she'll likely split her time between Syria and Canada.""My dream is to have a ministry for gender equality in Syria and be part of this work,"" she said.""I think a lot of us are gonna be between both countries and serving both countries equally.""But there are signs that Canada's doors-open attitude has been shifting in recent years, with Trudeau's government moving to reduce the number of permanent residents in the country as it grapples with a persistent cost of living and housing crisis.It is unclear what effect - if any - this would have on Canada's refugee resettlement programme. In 2023, the country became the fifth-largest recipient of asylum seekers worldwide. Maya Almasalmeh, a sociology student at Western University, was just 17 years old when she arrived in London, Ontario with her family in 2016.In the Syrian city of Deraa, she lost her grandfather - ""a second father figure"" - along with her home amidst the siege on the city, which would come to be known as the birthplace of the uprising against Assad.""He stole our childhood,"" she said.Being the eldest daughter of seven siblings in an immigrant home, she said, meant that she also viewed herself as a second parent figure to her many brothers and sisters. And that sense of responsibility extends beyond her front door in London.""Canada is the country that gave us peace, it [gave] me my education and helped me to develop to the person who I am today,"" Ms Almasalmeh said. But, she stressed, we ""will go back"" to help ""build the new generation.""She goes on to outline in great detail her long-term goals.""I want to be a social worker, because the people who helped us in the beginning, it was a lot of kind social workers,"" she explained, noting that her ""second home"" of Deraa will need people with her skills to rebuild.But like Ms Dureid and Mr Abdulwahed, the 25-year-old doesn't foresee Syria becoming a permanent base.""Canada is our home. I would say, it's our heart,"" she said. ""We will never forget how Canada gave us the chance to live happy again."" Yet some of those celebrating are also exercising a heavy level of caution before booking flights to see distant relatives.""Edmonton - this is my home. This is where my family is,"" explained 36-year-old Basel Abou Hamrah, who resettled in the Canadian prairies with his mother and three siblings in late 2015.Mr Abou Hamrah said there are concerns when he thinks about going back to Syria. Part of his struggles when he first arrived in Edmonton stemmed from the fact that he hadn't yet come out to his family as gay.There is also uncertainty about what the future holds for Syria, which was liberated by an Islamist rebel group that was once an off-shoot of Al-Qaeda, though it had rebranded itself in recent years.Questions have swirled on what type of government the group would form, and how much freedoms Syrians will have under this new leadership.""It's not safe for LGBTQ refugee people back home in Syria,"" he explained.Prior to the 2011 revolution, there were reports of gay menbeing targeted by police.Mr Abou Hamrah said this is why the news this week, that some European countries are choosing topause asylum decisionsfor Syrian refugees, causes him grave concern.""There are lots of LGBTQ refugees that - no matter what is the new government of the new Syria - they will not be safe,"" Mr Abou Hamrah said, citing how the situation in the country is still in ""flux"". Moving back to Syria on a more permanent basis may be, for others, the news they've been waiting to hear since the civil war pushed them from their homes years ago.""Canada gave us safety and dignity,"" explained Israa El Issa, a mother of four, from her home in Prince George, British Columbia. ""There has never been a day where I felt like a refugee or not Canadian or unwanted.""She and her family fled Aleppo and were later sponsored out of Lebanon by a group of private citizens on the western coast of Canada.Up until this week, she had been planning to carry on with her studies in Canada to one day become a nurse. But she said now that's all been put on hold: ""God willing I'll finish in Syria instead.""A motivating factor for returning to Syria is an intense feeling of ""estrangement"" she has felt for the family she left behind, after trying, and failing, to bring her father and mother to join her.""That's all I wanted,"" she explained. But her father died from cancer about eight months after she moved. She tried to bring her mom, but said she struggled navigating the system.""I tried so many times, but no result,"" she said.Despite these difficulties, she doesn't begrudge the country that took her in and instead views it as a natural process to want to return home.""At the end of the day, Syria is our country. And why are we refugees in the first place? Because there was war in our country and it wasn't safe to stay,"" she said.""But now that Syria is free from the oppression of Assad, and God willing safety returns to Syria, then of course we will return too."""
"Canada's finance minister quits over Trump tariff dispute with TrudeauChrystia Freeland says Canada faces a ""grave challenge"" from incoming US President Donald Trump's tariff threats.3 hrs agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2elggj813o,"Canada's Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland has resigned from her post, citing disagreements with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on how to respond to incoming President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs.She announced her resignation in a letter to Trudeau on Monday, in which she said the two have been ""at odds about the best path forward for Canada"", and pointed to the ""grave challenge"" posed by Trump's policy of ""aggressive economic nationalism"".Freeland said the decision comes after Trudeau informed her last week that he no longer wanted her to be his government's top economic adviser.Her resignation came hours before she was due to provide an annual fiscal government update in parliament. In recent days, the two have also reportedly been in a dispute over a policy that would have delivered a C$250 ($175; £139) cheque to every eligible Canadian.The BBC has reached out to the prime minister's office and the finance department for comment.In her publicly-shared resignation letter, Freeland said Canada needs to keep its ""fiscal powder dry"" to deal with the threat of sweeping tariffs from US President-elect Donald Trump.She added this means ""eschewing costly political gimmicks"" that Canada cannot afford.Trump has promised to imposea levy of 25% on imported Canadian goods, which economists have warned would significantly hurt Canada's economy.Referencing the tariffs, Freeland called them a ""threat"" that needs to be taken ""extremely seriously"".She added that this means ""pushing back against 'America First' economic nationalism"" and working with unity in response to these tariff threats.Freeland and Trudeau were reportedly in disagreement over a series of recently-proposed policies by the prime minister designed to address the country's cost-of-living crisis.Among them is a cheque of C$250 that the government wanted to send to every Canadian earning less than C$150,000 annually. These cheques were expected to cost the federal government a total of C$4.68bn.Another is a temporary tax break on essential items during the holidays which is anticipated to cost C$1.6bn in lost tax revenue.Freeland's office had reportedly been concerned about the price of these two policies, saying they are economically unwise at a time when the country's deficit is growing.The tax holiday has since been approved in the House of Commons, but the C$250-cheques hit a hurdle when the New Democratic Party - a centre-left party in parliament - signalled it would not lend its support to the policy unless it is expanded.A poll bythe Angus Reid Institute showed that four out of five Canadians viewed the cheques as a political movedesigned to win public goodwill as Trudeau's popularity plummets.Freeland, who also holds the position of deputy prime minister, has long been one of Trudeau's closest allies within his Liberal party. She has held the key role of Canada's finance minister since 2020, helping to lead the country through the pandemic and its aftermath.She replaced former Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who also resigned from his post amid a dispute with Trudeau over government spending policies, as well as conflict-of-interest allegations he faced involving a youth charity.Other members of the Liberal party's cabinet have since reacted to her resignation.""These are difficult and deeply personal decisions and obviously she's made that decision and I respect her for it,"" said Patty Hajdu, Canada's minister for indigenous relations.Minister of Transport Anita Anand described Freeland as a ""good friend,"" and added: ""This news has hit me really hard and I'll reserve further comment until I have time to process it.""It is unclear if the fall economic statement will be delivered on Monday as planned in light of Freeland's resignation. A government official told Reuters news agency that the finance ministry is determining next steps.Canada's public broadcaster CBC reported that Freeland's resignation was not expected today, citing a senior federal government source.Freeland said she intends to stay on as a Liberal member of parliament, and that she will run again in Canada's upcoming election, which must be held on or before October.Her resignation comes after another cabinet member, housing minister Sean Fraser, announced he will not be seeking re-election, saying he wants to spend more time with his family."
"US officials in 'direct contact' with victorious Syria rebelsSecretary of State Antony Blinken confirms contact with the HTS group, despite it still being on the US terrorism list.1 day agoMiddle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y46713z21o,"The US has made ""direct contact"" with the HTS rebels who now control Syria after topplingthe Assad regime, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.It is the first acknowledgement of direct US interaction with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which the US currently still designates as a terrorist organisation.Blinken told reporters the US has been in contact in particular over the fate of the missing American journalist, Austin Tice.Blinken was speaking in Jordan after talks with representatives from several Arab countries, Turkey, and Europe to discuss the future of Syria. Officials agreed to support a peaceful transition process in the country, with Jordan's foreign minister saying that regional powers did not want to see it ""descend into chaos"".A joint communique called for an inclusive Syrian government that respects the rights of minorities and does not offer a base for ""terrorist groups"".The talk both inside and outside Syria after the tumultuous events of recent weeks has been of the vital importance of setting up new governance that represents all Syrians.HTS was not present at the meeting in Jordan.There, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein expressed concern over Syria's future shared across the Middle East and beyond.He said regional players did not want to see another Libya - referring to the chaos that ensued after Colonel Gaddafi's removal from power.Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said existing Syrian institutions must be preserved and reformed.""Never allow terrorism to take advantage of the transition period. And we have to coordinate our efforts and learn from the mistakes of the past,"" Fidan said according to Reuters news agency. Trump says Syria 'not our fight'. Staying out may not be so easyUS military flies freed captive Travis Timmerman out of SyriaFormer Syria prison head charged with torture in US Meanwhile, Israel has launched dozens more air strikes against Syria, according to a war monitor, despite regional condemnation.Israelhas previously saidit was taking action to ""destroy strategic capabilities"" that threaten it.The UN Secretary General has said he is ""particularly concerned"" about the hundreds of Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Syria.HTS, Syria's most powerful rebel group, was set up under a different name,Jabhat al-Nusra, in 2011 as a direct al-Qaeda affiliate. It was considered to be one of the most effective and deadly groups opposing President Assad.It was proscribed as a terrorist group by the UN, the US, Turkey, and other countries - and currently remains so.Its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who previously used the name Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, cut ties with al-Qaeda in 2016. He has recently pledged tolerance for different religious groups and communities.But the group's violent jihadist past has left some doubting whether it will live up to such promises.Missing from the talks in Jordan was any representative from Syria. The foreign ministers from eight Arab countries who did attend the meeting said they wanted to ensure that Syria was unified and not split along sectarian lines.Also absent were the two countries that gave financial support to Assad which enabled him to survive in power for so long - Iran and Russia.Assad's downfall followed a 13-year civil war, which started after he crushed pro-democracy protests. The fighting killed more than half a million people, displaced millions more, and embroiled international powers and their proxies.The shadow of all the outside forces that battled over Syria for so long hangs heavy over its future.Syria's next leaders will need cohesion not just inside the country but outside, too, if there is to be any real hope for the Syrian people to build on the freedom they have experienced in the past week.

"Pelosi has hip replacement surgery after fall in LuxembourgPelosi, 84, was airlifted by the US military to a hospital in Germany after she tripped at an event.2 days agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce329pv42y4o,"Former US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has had hip replacement surgery after injuring herself while on an official trip to Luxembourg, her office says.""Earlier this morning, Speaker Emerita Pelosi underwent a successful hip replacement and is well on the mend,"" her spokesman Ian Kreger said in a statement.Pelosi, 84, was airlifted by the US military to a hospital in Germany after she reportedly tripped and fell on stairs while attending an official event on Friday.The California Democratic congresswoman was travelling with a bipartisan delegation of lawmakers to Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. Pelosi thanked both US military staff at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany and medical staff at Hospital Kirchberg in Luxembourg.""Speaker Pelosi is enjoying the overwhelming outpouring of prayers and well wishes and is ever determined to ensure access to quality health care for all Americans,"" the statement added.She has withdrawn from the rest of the events she had scheduled for the trip.In an earlier statement on Friday, Mr Kreger said Pelosi was looking forward to returning home to the US soon and was continuing to work from hospital.The delegation she was travelling with in Luxembourg is scheduled to take part in anniversary events along with veterans, their families and military officials.One of the congressmen on the trip, Michael McCaul, said he was disappointed Pelosi would not be able to join the delegation's weekend events.""But she is strong, and I am confident she will be back on her feet in no time,"" the Texas Republican said.Pelosi has been a prominent figure in US politics over a career stretching seven presidential administrations.She first served as House speaker from 2007-11, a post second in line to the presidency after the vice-president, then regained the job in 2019 after her party took back control of the chamber.She resigned as Speaker in 2023, but continues to serve in the House and remains a highly influential voice within the Democratic Party.Last month, she was elected to another two-year term.She is not the only member of Congress to be injured in a fall this week.Outgoing Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, 82, suffered a sprained wrist and cuts to his face at the US Capitol."
Tornado hits northern California town as ice storm chills MidwestA twister touched down in Scotts Valley as one person was killed during ice storms in Nebraska.20 hrs agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv8z7jx70o,"At least four people were injured after a tornado struck northern California on Saturday afternoon, according to local authorities.The twister flipped over several cars and brought down power lines in Scotts Valley, located around 55 miles (89km) south of San Francisco, police said.The National Weather Service (NWS) said the tornado was categorised as an EF1, one of the weakest classifications, and that it lasted around five minutes.Elsewhere in the US, an ice storm swept into the Midwestern states of Iowa and Nebraska, heavy snowfall hit upstate New York, and severe weather warnings were issued around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the states of California and Nevada. In Nebraska, at least one person was killed in a crash on an icy road near Arlington. Washington County Sheriff's Office said a 57-year-old woman lost control of her pickup truck and crashed into an oncoming vehicle.A major highway between Iowa and Nebraska, Interstate 80, was shut down as vehicles slid off the road due to the icy conditions. It has since reopened.In upstate New York, people ploughed snow out of their driveways, with more than 33in (83cm) of snow reported near Orchard Park in Erie County.To the west, in Nevada, up to 3ft of snow was predicted in the Sierra Nevada mountains.Snow also hit areas around Lake Tahoe, with some ski resorts seeing more than 1ft.A 112mph gust of wind was recorded at the Mammoth Mountain resort south of Yosemite National Park, the NWS said.In California's Scotts Valley, the tornado touched down at 13:39 local time (21:39 GMT) on Saturday, police said.The local fire service said four people had been injured and two of them had been taken to hospital, the BBC's US partnerCBS Newsreported.Wind speeds were estimated to have peaked at around 90mph, the NWS said.The weather agency also said the twister had been around 30 yards wide and travelled for a quarter of a mile before subsiding. Earlier on Saturday, a brief tornado warning was issued to residents of downtown San Francisco and San Mateo County just before 06:00 local time.San Francisco last saw a tornado in 2005, though that struck without any clear radar signature, so no warning was issued in that case, NWS meteorologist Roger Glass told AP news agency.As of Sunday, more than 40,000 customers were still without power along the California coast, with Monterey county the worst affected,according to the PowerOutage website.San Francisco's tornado alert came just a week after the citysaw its first ever tsunami warning.The brief advisory was issued for northern California and southern Oregon following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that hit off the northern coast of the state.It was later rescinded, and no injuries were reported."
The dark fandom behind healthcare CEO murder suspectOnline adulation painting Luigi Mangione as a folk hero and fuelled by health system anger has worried authorities.3 days agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8nk75vg81o,"They came in hoodies, they came in masks, shuffling their feet and laughing nervously while waiting for a winner to be announced.Just a few days after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was murdered on a New York City sidewalk, these young men had lined up in Washington Square Park to compete in a lookalike contest for the man wanted for his murder.It was sparsely attended and seen as a joke by those who did turn up, said Talia Jane, a journalist who was there.But it underlined an obsession with a murder suspect that has gripped social media since the killing on 4 December, fuelled by latent anger directed at America's private health insurers.""There was a lot of tinder already there, a lot of discontent, a lot of frustration already there, and [this] sort of threw a match on it,"" Ms Jane said.And it has only grown since the suspect was named as Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League-educated member of a prominent Baltimore family.Tracing the powerful family roots of suspected killer Luigi MangioneIn TikTok videos, memes and group chats, a young man accused of shooting a father-of-two in the back on a New York City sidewalk has been fawned over and praised as a kind of folk hero.This fetishisation was remarkably widespread, not limited to radical corners of the internet or any political affiliation, troubling many observers.""We do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,"" said Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, where Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's.""In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice."" Almost immediately after Mr Thompson was shot dead, the internet began to lionise his suspected killer. On TikTok, people posted videos of a ""CEO assassin"" New York City walking tour. On Spotify, playlists dedicated to the suspect started to appear.Once Mr Mangione was arrested, these fans came to his defence.The start of his legal battles prompted anonymous donors to chip in thousands of dollars towards his defence through various online fundraisers.Etsy was flooded with pro-Mangione apparel, while Amazon pulled similar products from their site.The McDonald's worker alleged to have turned him in has become a target for online hate, while the fast-food franchise itself has been spammed with bad reviews.The police department in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that arrested him even received death threats.Much of this online reaction has focused on his looks, with the internet dubbing him the ""hot assassin"".Indeed, Mr Mangione's appearance, which he showed off in shirtless social media posts, is now clearly part of the appeal, said cultural critic Blakely Thornton.Americans are effectively ""programmed"" to trust and empathise with men who look like Mr Mangione, he said.""That's why they are the protagonists in our movies, books and stories.""Public adoration for handsome menaccused of crimes is not new - from Ted Bundy to Jeremy Meeks, violent men have developed cult followings.But Professor Tanya Horeck, an expert on digital culture and true crime from Anglia Ruskin University, says that social media has given those sentiments massive visibility, and helped them spread.The internet has caused ""a blurring of the lines between celebrity and criminality"", she told the BBC, adding that when people see a good-looking person pop into their feeds, their first thought is lust, not moral criticism.""The mood around Luigi Mangione is 'thirst',"" she said.Beyond his appearance, a large part of Mr Mangione's online appeal is clearly his apparent ire against the private healthcare industry and corporate elites in general. US media has reported that Mr Mangione was arrested carrying a handwritten document that said ""these parasites had it coming"".The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), a non-profit extremism research group based in New Jersey, said that after the shooting the hashtag #EatTheRich went viral.Since Mr Mangione's arrest, variations of ""#FreeLuigi"" were posted on X over 50,000 times, likely getting tens of millions of impressions. And by some measures, the NCRI said, engagement with posts about Mr Thompson's killing across platforms like X, Reddit, and others surpassed that of the assassination attempt against Donald Trump in July. An analysis of a sample of comments carried out by market research firm OneCliq found the vast majority - four-fifths - contained criticism of the healthcare system.Mr Mangione's X account has gained more than 400,000 followers since the shooting.The shooting also seemed to inspire others to take action against healthcare insurers - ""wanted"" posters of other CEOs appeared around New York City,and a woman in Florida was arrestedafter telling an insurance agent on the phone ""Delay, Deny, Depose. You people are next,"" alluding to the words inscribed on bullet casings found at the murder scene.Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser at the NCRI, called the online reaction a ""turning point"" and ""a catalyst for the normalisation of political violence that was once confined to extremists on the fringes"".He compared the wave of comments to the online activity following racist mass murders, designed to defend the killers and signal-boost their beliefs - only more widespread, and happening across mainstream social media networks.""The dynamic we are observing is eerily similar to the activity on platforms like 4chan, 8chan, Discord, and in other dark corners of the internet, where mass shootings are often met with glee,"" he said.Tim Weninger, a computer science professor at Notre Dame and expert in social media and artificial intelligence, said evidence suggests that the groundswell was authentic - not powered by bots or government influence operations.""People are pissed off at the healthcare industry and they are using social media to express their frustrations,"" he said. ""They're expressing those frustrations by supporting this suspect."" Recent research by Commonwealth Fund, a health policy institute, found 45% of insured working-age adults were charged for something they thought should have been free or covered by insurance, and 17% of respondents said their insurer denied coverage for care that was recommended by their doctor.There are indications that the shooting has prompted some introspection on the part of healthcare companies.""I think all of us are taking a step back and trying to understand what's happening with patients and their experiences,"" Pfizer's chief sustainability officer Caroline Roan told a conference in New York on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Some of the people who have been protesting against health insurance companies for years, before online criticism about UHC took off, understand some of the darker sentiments, even if they don't endorse them.""It's a horrific act of violence, and I absolutely condemn it no matter the motivation,"" Jenn Coffey, who has been fighting to get UHC to cover her medical bills, said of Mr Thompson's killing. ""But I'm not shocked by the reaction."" Ms Coffey, 53, from Manchester, New Hampshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 and later fell ill with complex regional pain syndrome, a potentially debilitating neurological condition. When a doctor suggested that she try ketamine therapy, her UHC insurance would not cover the procedure, she said. She has since become involved in a protest campaign organised by activist group People's Action.Ms Coffey's illness forced her to stop working as an emergency medical technician. She said she started a crowdfunding drive and had to sell most of her belongings in order to pay for the treatment herself.""I get to have some normality. I can sit up and paint, or I can enjoy a meal with my family"" because of the treatment, she said. ""I can have a life that's worth living.""UnitedHealth Group told the BBC they could not comment on individual cases for privacy reasons.At the same time, much of the online discussion has effectively ignored the victim, Brian Thompson, who was 50.""It's incredibly bleak that [Thompson's death] hasn't been covered as much because, bottom line, a person died, a person was murdered,"" Blakely Thornton said.""The collective rage over [the healthcare industry] is really outweighing what is still a tragedy."" In his last post on LinkedIn, Mr Thompson talked about efforts to make healthcare more affordable - and was criticised in the comments. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, obtained a message that UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty sent to staff this week, memorialising Mr Thompson and calling his murdered colleague ""one of the good guys"".""He was certainly one of the smartest guys. I think he was one of the best guys. I'm going to miss him. And I am incredibly proud to call him my friend,"" he wrote.In the email, the company shared messages from customers, including one who wrote about recovering from cancer, saying their treatment was paid for by the insurance company's benefits.""I'm thankful to UHC and everyone there who works within a broken system to help as many people as they can,"" they wrote, according to the company.Another message said: ""So very sad that this world is so hateful. I have always had great experiences with UHC.""Ms Coffey, the UHC policyholder and patient, said: ""My heart goes out to the family and I can't imagine what they're having to struggle with that [killing]. It's awful to me that this is the catalyst for this debate.""""I would have much rather sat down and had a conversation with him.""With additional reporting from Grace Dean"
"Xi Jinping not expected to attend Trump inaugurationChina's ambassador is expected to attend and other officials may join him, two people told the BBC's US partner CBS.3 days agoWorld",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm9jvek93po,"Chinese President Xi Jinping is unlikely to attend the US presidential inauguration in January despite an invitation from Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the planning.China's ambassador to the US is expected to attend and other officials from Beijing may also join him, the sources told the BBC's US partner CBS News.CBS first reported on the unusual invitation – records indicate no foreign leaders have ever attended a presidential inauguration.""This is an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just allies but our adversaries and our competitors too,"" Trump's spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Fox News. Trump has at times praised Xi but has also been heavily critical of China. He has pledged to sharply increase tariffs on imported Chinese goods when he takes office next month.In October, Trump told podcaster Joe Rogan: ""He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. I mean, he's a brilliant guy, whether you like it or not.""A number of Trump's cabinet picks including Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz are sharp critics of the Chinese government.The Chinese government has placed sanctions on Rubio and in 2020 banned him from entering the country.Waltz has urged the US to urgently end the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to ""counter the greater threat from the Chinese Communist Party"".US intelligence agencies recently said that China is behind a hack of eight large US telecommunications companies. The hackers may have accessed data on millions of Americans, according to the White House.Since winning re-election last month, Trump has met with a number of foreign leaders including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Argentinian President Javier Milei and French President Emmanuel Macron, who invited Trump to Paris for the re-opening of Notre Dame Cathedral.Although it's common for diplomats and ambassadors to attend the president's swearing-in, according to US State Department records dating back to 1874, a foreign leader has never attended the inauguration of a US president.Leavitt said that other foreign leaders had also been invited to the inauguration, which will be held in Washington DC on 20 January, but did not specify which ones.The BBC has contacted Chinese officials and the Trump presidential transition team for comment."
How Luigi Mangione's legal defence could take shapePolice believe forensic and ballistic evidence ties the suspect to insurance CEO Brian Thompson's killing.5 days agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm987p8xz3o,"Forensic and ballistic evidence that police say ties the accused murderer of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson to the crime scene will make it difficult for his lawyers to mount a defence, former prosecutors and other legal experts say.Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested in Pennsylvania on Monday after a days-long, multi-state manhunt ended at a McDonalds in the town of Altoona.New York authorities say fingerprints and shell casings link him to the crime scene.His lawyer, Thomas Dickey, earlier told local media he had not ""seen any evidence yet"" implicating his client. He said Mr Mangione would plead not guilty to the charges he faces in Pennsylvania, including firearms charges.In New York, he has been charged with second-degree murder over Mr Thompson's killing and it is not clear how he would plead. He is currently being held in a state prison in Pennsylvania where he is fighting extradition to face that murder charge. The legal battle over his extradition could potentially take more than a month to resolve, officials said.But legal experts told the BBC that his efforts to contest his extradition to New York are unlikely to be successful. They could, however, provide his defence with a glimpse into the state's evidence against him.""I don't even know if this is him,"" his lawyer, Mr Dickey, said in a recent interview with US media outlet NewsNation, referring to images of Mr Thompson's killer.""We're going to test those waters and give the government a chance to bring some evidence forward,"" he said.How the six-day manhunt unfoldedWhat is a ghost gun, the weapon allegedly used in shooting?Who is the CEO shooting suspect?Who was UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson?If he is extradited to New York to face the murder charge, Mitchell Epner, a New York-based lawyer and former prosecutor, told the BBC that  there are, broadly, two approaches that Mr Mangione could take if he pleads not guilty.""Defence number one is 'it wasn't me' and defence number two is 'it was me, but I shouldn't be punished' because of X,"" he said.According to New York police, Mr Mangione was found with a gun similar to the murder weapon, a silencer and a fake ID, as well as three handwritten pages which they believe suggest a potential motive.Mr Epner said that the publicly known evidence so far means denying responsibility is ""out the window"".Another New York-based lawyer, criminal defence attorney and Professor Dmitriy Shakhnevich, said Mr Mangione's attorney could also, in theory, argue that an impaired ""mental status"" makes him unfit to stand trial.""If a judge makes a determination that he's misunderstanding, or not understanding, what's happening in court, then essentially the case won't go forward,"" he  said.""He'll be institutionalised for a period of time until he's deemed to be fit, which may be never.""That defence, Mr Shakhnevich added, is different to a plea of insanity, in which his lawyers could argue that ""he's not responsible for his actions because of some mental defect"".""That could also deem him not guilty, because you won't satisfy the elements of the offence,"" he said. ""But then again, he doesn't go free. He would be institutionalised for a period, assuming that defence is successful."" The start of Mr Mangione's legal battles has prompted anonymous donors to chip in thousands of dollars towards his defence through online fundraisers.It comes as some online have shared support for the suspect and anger at the health insurance industry. The New York City Police Department has also warned some healthcare executives are potentially in danger because of a ""hit list"" posted online after Mr Thompson's murder.In a bulletin, the NYPD said several viral posts included the names and salaries of other insurance executives. Mocked-up wanted signs featuring some executives have also been posted in Manhattan.Mr Mangione allegedly had grievances with the wider industry.Timothy Gallagher, a former FBI agent and the managing director of Nardello and Co, a global investigations firm, said the current climate means the ""threat of a copycat is real"".""There are people out there who have grievances and are observing the amount of press and attention that is being given to the accused,"" he said.Mr Gallagher said that there has been an ""outpouring of support from dark corners of the internet"" for anti-corporate causes.""I'm afraid that may fuel follow-on attacks,"" he said."
