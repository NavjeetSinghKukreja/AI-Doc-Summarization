"Assad says he didn't intend to leave Syria, statement claimsIn what appears to be his first reaction since fleeing, the former president says Russia decided to airlift him to Moscow.4 hrs agoWorld",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yd0zz5edqo,"Syria's former President Bashar al-Assad says he never intended to flee to Russia - in what is purported to be his first statement since the fall of Damascus eight days ago.Assad's reported statement was put on the Telegram channel belonging to the Syrian presidency on Monday, although it is not clear who currently controls it - or whether he wrote it.In it he says that, as the Syrian capital fell to rebels, he went to a Russian military base in Latakia province ""to oversee combat operations"" only to see that Syrian troops had abandoned positions.Hmeimim airbase had also come under ""intensified attack by drone strikes"" and the Russians had decided to airlift him to Moscow, he says. In the statement - published both in Arabic and English - the former Syrian leader reportedly describes what happened on 8 December - and how he was apparently besieged at the Russian base.""With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base's command arrange an immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday 8th December,"" the statement reads.""This took place a day after the fall of Damascus, following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all remaining state institutions.""'I felt like a breathing corpse': Stories from people freed from Syria torture prisonBowen: Syrians search for dead loved ones - and closureThe statement adds that ""at no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge, nor was such a proposal made by any individual or party"".""When the state falls into the hands of terrorism and the ability to make a meaningful contribution is lost, any position becomes void of purpose,"" it says. Assad was nowhere to be seen as Syrian cities and provinces fell to rebels led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) within a period of 12 days.However, speculation mounted that he had fled the country as even his prime minister was not able to contact him during the rebel sweep into Damascus.On 9 December, Russian media announced that he had been given asylum there - even though there has not been any official confirmation.The Syrian rebel groups are continuing to form a transitional government.HTS, Syria's most powerful rebel group, was set up under a different name, Jabhat al-Nusra, in 2011 and pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year.Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda in 2016 and later took the name HTS when it merged with other factions. However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to designate it as a terrorist group.Its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who previously used the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has pledged tolerance for different religious groups and communities. But his group's jihadist past has left some doubting whether it will live up to such promises."
Commentator Isa Guha sorry for calling Indian cricketer 'primate'Guha apologises after her remark about Jasprit Bumrah caused a backlash.10 hrs agoAsia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9gy7938xeo,"Cricket commentator Isa Guha has apologised for calling Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah the ""most valuable primate"" during the third Test against Australia.She made the remark while commentating for Fox Sports in Brisbane on Sunday after Bumrah got India off to a stunning start with two quick wickets.Her comment sparked a social media backlash which noted the word's history as a racial slur.On Monday, Guha apologised on air: ""Yesterday in commentary I used a word that can be interpreted in a number of different ways... I'd like to apologise for any offence caused."" Guha, who is also a BBC commentator and former England cricketer, had been speaking live on air with colleagues Brett Lee and Allan Border when the controversy happened.""Bumrah, today: five overs, 2-4. So, that's the tone, and that's what you want from the ex-skipper,"" Lee said.Guha responded: ""Well, he's the MVP, isn't he? [The] most valuable primate, Jasprit Bumrah. He is the one that's going to do all the talking for India, and why so much focus was on him in the build-up to this Test match, and whether he would be fit.""In her apology on Monday, she said: ""I set myself really high standards when it comes to empathy and respect for others and if you listen to the full transcript, I only meant the highest praise for one of India's greatest players and someone that I admire greatly as well,"" she said.She said she had been ""trying to frame the enormity of his achievements and I have chosen the wrong word and for that I am deeply sorry"".""As someone who is also of South Asian heritage, I hope people would recognise there was no other intention or malice there,"" she said.Former India coach Ravi Shastri, a fellow Fox Sports commentator, commended her for the apology and urged India to ""move on"".""People are entitled to make mistakes. We are all human. To own up and say, 'I'm sorry' … it takes courage. She's done it.""As far as the Indian team, there is a Test on and they want to focus on the game,"" he said.Bumrah continued his achievements on Monday, taking his sixth wicket of the innings.Allegations of racism are not unheard of in international cricket, while an independent report into cricket published last year found that racism, sexism, classism and elitism were ""widespread"" in the English and Welsh game."
"Remembering the man who became Indian music's global ambassadorZakir Hussain, legendary tabla virtuoso, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy.11 hrs agoAsia",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwype77kwyjo,"Zakir Hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of Indian classical musicwho has died aged 73, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy that will inspire generations.A child prodigy, he collaborated with Indian classical icons like Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, and Shivkumar Sharma and global musicians like John McLaughlin and George Harrison.Born on 9 March, 1951, in Mahim, Mumbai, he was the eldest son of Ustad Allarakha, one of history's most iconic players of the tabla - a pair of traditional Indian hand played drums.Hussain's journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation.Hussain's life revolved around rhythm from the very beginning.The sound of the tabla was his first language, his earliest ""words"". By the age of 12, he was already performing globally, accompanying stalwarts like Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan during his teenage years.While rooted in the Hindustani classical tradition, Hussain possessed an insatiable curiosity that propelled him to explore other genres, leading to ground-breaking collaborations across the world.In 1973, he co-founded Shakti with guitarist John McLaughlin, a group that fused Indian classical music with jazz and Western traditions, creating a new global sound.Over five decades, Shakti evolved, featuring luminaries like violinist L Shankar, percussionist Vikku Vinayakram, and mandolin maestro U Srinivas.Their first studio album in 46 years, This Moment, won the Grammy for Best Global Music Album in 2024, marking a fitting finale to their 50th-anniversary tour. Hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to Shakti's success and to the global appreciation of Indian rhythms. Zakir Hussain's contributions extended far beyond Shakti.He was a key collaborator in Planet Drum and Global Drum Project, both with Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, earning him Grammy Awards in 1991 and 2008.He worked with banjo maestro Béla Fleck and bassist Edgar Meyer on the Grammy-winning As We Speak (2024), further cementing his status as a pioneer of cross-genre collaborations. He also collaborated with musicians as diverse as Yo-Yo Ma, George Harrison, Van Morrison and Billy Cobham, bringing Indian classical music to global audiences.His ventures like Tabla Beat Science, a fusion of Indian classical music with electronic and world music, and orchestral works such asPeshkarfor the Symphony Orchestra of India showcased his unrelenting drive to innovate while respecting his roots.""The moment you think you're a maestro, you are distancing yourself from the others,"" Hussain toldRolling Stone Indiamagazine earlier this year. ""You have to be part of a group, and not dominate it.""This philosophy made him not only a consummate artist but also a lifelong learner and mentor.Hussain's flamboyance and speed and precision of his performances earned him widespread admiration.The New York Times, in its review of a 2009 jazz performance at Carnegie Hall, described his artistry as embodying""an impish strain of virtuosity"".""He's a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. So he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings."" His accolades are as numerous as the beats he crafted.A recipient of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, Hussain was also a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow in the United States. He delighted audiences at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and collaborated with jazz legends, Western classical orchestras, and Carnatic music maestros.Despite his global acclaim, Hussain remained deeply connected to his Indian roots. His early years in a modest chawl - large tenement complexes - in Mahim shaped his values.""For the first three-and-a-half years of my life, we all lived in one room that had no toilet. We had to use the common toilets,"" Hussain told Nasreen Munni Kabir.Offstage, Hussain was an avid reader and a fan of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. He loved poetry, cricket, and tennis, counting Roger Federer among his heroes. His curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like Ravi Shankar and Miles Davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. Hussain would also later say that his TV advert for a popular tea brand - Taj Mahal - ""made me famous in India"".Hussain's death marks the end of an era but leaves an indelible mark on global music. Kabir, who chronicled his life, aptly captured his essence: ""Zakir's extraordinary playing and the extreme sense of rigour he brought to his art made him a phenomenon.""Music for Hussain was not just a career but a spiritual journey - a way to connect with people, traditions, and cultures across the globe.In his final years, Hussain remained as active as ever, performing, mentoring, and composing.""Being a student and having a drive to learn keeps me going. The opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself. Age doesn't affect my energy and drive,"" he said last year."
"Mayotte feels like nuclear war aftermath since cyclone, residents sayRescuers comb through the debris in the French Indian Ocean territory hit by the worst storm in 90 years.2 hrs agoWorld",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c205wnvlqn6o,"Residents of Mayotte have spoken of ""apocalyptic scenes"" caused by the worst storm in 90 years to hit the French Indian Ocean territory.Cyclone Chido brought wind speeds of more than 225km/h (140mph), flattening areas where the poorest lived in sheet-metal roof shacks.""We've had no water for three days now,"" said one resident of the capital city Mamoudzou. ""Some of my neighbours are hungry and thirsty,"" another one said.Rescue workers, including reinforcements from France, are combing through the debris searching for survivors. Twenty people have been confirmed dead, but the local prefect said it could be thousands. Are you in Mayotte?Please share your experiencesWhat are cyclones? Authorities said they were having difficulty establishing the number of deaths due to the large number of undocumented migrants - over 100,000 - in a population of 320,000.Widespread damage to infrastructure - with downed power lines and impassable roads - is severely hindering emergency operations.Supplies have begun to arrive, but there are severe shortages of food, water and shelter in certain areas. Some 85% of the territory remains without power, and about 20% of phones appear to be working. Some areas are beginning to get tap water.But for Amalia Mazon, a 27-year-old midwife from Brussels who has been working at the island's central hospital, access to drinking water and food continues to be a concern.""The water here is completely yellow. It's unusable for us,"" Ms Mazon told the BBC.""We feel completely abandoned, and we don't even know if help is coming. We have no news, we have no idea,"" the midwife added.Acting French health minister Geneviève Darrieussecq said the healthcare system in the archipelago had been ""degraded"" by the cyclone.France colonised Mayotte in 1841- and by the turn of the 20th Century added the three main islands that constitute the Comoros archipelago to its overseas territories.The Comoros voted to become independent in 1974 but Mayotte decided to remain part of France.The island's population is heavily dependent on French financial aid and has struggled with poverty, unemployment and political instability.About 75% of the population live below the national poverty line and unemployment hovers at around one in three.""The images are apocalyptic. It's a disaster, there's nothing left,"" a nurse working at the main hospital in Mamoudzou told BFM TV.Mamoudzou resident, John Balloz, said he was surprised he did not die when the cyclone struck.""Everything is damaged, nearly everything, the water treatment plant, electric pylons, there's a lot to do.""Mohamed Ishmael, who also lives in the capital,told Reuters news agency: ""You feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war… I saw an entire neighbourhood disappear.""""It's the hunger that worries me most,"" Mayotte Senator Salama Ramia told French media. ""There are people who have had nothing to eat or drink"" since Saturday, she said. Francois-Xavier Bieuville, the island's prefect, told local media the death toll could rise significantly once the damage was fully assessed. He warned it would ""definitely be several hundred"" and could reach the thousands.Mayotte's impoverished communities, including undocumented migrants who have travelled to the French territory in an effort to claim asylum, are thought to have been particularly hard hit due to the vulnerable nature of their housing.The Muslim tradition of burying the dead within 24 hours also meant documenting the number of those who have perished was more difficult, the prefect said.In addition to aid, 110 French soldiers have arrived to help with the rescue, with another 160 on the way. Some 800 others from the ranks of volunteers helping during emergencies were also being sent to join local police units.After arriving in Mayotte, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said ""days and days"" would be needed to ascertain human losses.The relief operation is being co-ordinated from Reunion - another French overseas territory.French Red Cross spokesman Eric Sam Vah told the BBC the situation was ""chaotic"".He said the organisation had been able to reach only 20 out of 200 Red Cross volunteers in Mayotte and echoed fears about the overall number of deaths.""The totality of the slums have been totally destroyed, we haven't received any reports of displaced people, so the reality could be terrible in the coming days,"" the spokesman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Cyclone Chido also made landfall in Mozambique, where it brought flash flooding, uprooted trees and damaged buildings about 25 miles (40km) south of the northern city of Pemba. Three deaths have been reported.The cyclone caused structural damage and power outages in the northern coastal provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado on Saturday morning, local authorities reported.Guy Taylor, a spokesperson for aid agency Unicef in Mozambique, said ""we were hit very hard in the early hours of this morning"".""Many houses were destroyed or seriously damaged, and healthcare facilities and schools are out of action,"" he added.Mr Taylor said Unicef was concerned about ""loss of access to critical services"", including medical treatment, clean water and sanitation, and also ""the spread of diseases like cholera and malaria"". Chido is the latest deadly storm to form of such high intensity.It strengthened as a result of its long track over the ocean, says Sarah Keith-Lucas from the BBC Weather Centre. The cyclone would have weakened had it made landfall on Madagascar's rugged terrain.But it is also the case that climate change has an impact - not necessarily in the frequency of storms but in the strength, Keith-Lucas says.The storm has been now downgraded to a ""depression"" and is due to cross southern Malawi, then Mozambique's Tete province, before heading towards Zimbabwe overnight into Tuesday.It may still bring 150-300mm of rain by the end of Tuesday.Additional reporting by Eva van Dam."
Jeremy Bowen: Assad's torture prison is worst I have seenInside the infamous prison's corridors it becomes clear how hard it will be to mend the Syria that Assad broke.2 hrs agoMiddle East,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62w5q52pngo,"Saydnaya prison sits on a forbidding hill about half an hour's drive from the centre of Damascus.In the last few days the entrance has been repainted in the green, white and black of Syria's revolutionary flag. The new colours did not dispel the sinister atmosphere of the place.As I walked through the gates, I thought of the despair that must have gripped the thousands of Syrians who made the same journey.One estimate is that more than 30,000 detainees were killed in Saydnaya in the years since the start of the Syrian war in 2011. That is a large proportion of the more than 100,000 people, almost all men but including thousands of women – as well as children – who disappeared without trace into Bashar al-Assad's gulag. Other parts of Assad's prison system were less cruel. Phone calls home were allowed, and families were allowed to visit.But Saydnaya was the dark and rotten heart of the regime. Fear of being consigned there and killed without anyone knowing what had happened was a central part of the Assad regime's system of coercion and repression.The authorities did not have to tell families who had been incarcerated there. Allowing them to fear the worst was another way of applying pressure. The regime kept its boot on the throat of Syrians because of the power, reach and savagery of its myriad and overlapping intelligence agencies, and because of the routine use of torture and execution.I was in other infamous prisons in the days after they were liberated, including Abu Salim, the former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's notorious jail in Tripoli and Pul-e-Charki outside Kabul in Afghanistan.Neither were as foul and pestilent as Saydnaya. In its overcrowded cells men had to urinate into plastic bags as their access to latrines was limited.When the locks were smashed open, they left behind their filthy rags and scraps of blankets which were all they had to cover themselves as they slept on the floor. Torture and execution have already been documented in Saydnaya.In the months to come it is certain that more information about the horrors perpetrated inside its walls will emerge from former inmates.In Saydnaya's corridors you can see how hard it will be to mend the country Assad broke to try to save his regime. Now that the prison has been broken open, like the country, it has become a microcosm of all the challenges Syria faces since the Assad regime crumpled and was swept away. One challenge is making a record of exactly what the regime did to its victims. In a sign of how far Syria has come in just a week, volunteers went to the prison to try to preserve Saydnaya's records.Paperwork is scattered around offices and even on the concrete floor of the prison yard. Families pick up files and sheets of tattered documentation, trying to find a name, a date or a place that they recognise.The disarray of the records looks as if someone tried to destroy what was done here in the name of Bashar al-Assad's Syria. When dictators and their henchmen fall, making sure they don't take the truth with them is a big part of a better future. A musician called Safana Bakleh gave her group of volunteers face masks and blue nitrile gloves along with instructions about photographing and collecting documents.Safana admitted they were amateurs and said they were taking matters into their own hands because the international human rights groups were not there, and evidence and documents were disappearing.""Even if one family gets one answer that their loved on is not here anymore is deceased or he died in the hospital it is enough for me"" Safana told me. ""It is very chaotic. We don't where are the international originations supposed to be documenting all this chaos.""It is not just about families getting some release through at least knowing what happened to the disappeared. One day there might be trials of the perpetrators. Documents are evidence. The truth the volunteers uncovered with their own eyes shocked them. All Syrians knew that the prisons were bad, but Saydnaya was much worse than they expected.  Widad Halabi, one of the volunteers, took off her face mask and broke down in tears after an hour or so looking for evidence in the cell blocks.""What I've seen here is a life not fit for humans. I imagined how they lived, their clothes. How did they breathe? How did they eat? How did they feel?""It's terrible… terrible. There are bags of urine on the floor. They couldn't go to the toilet, so they had to put urine in bags. The smell. There's no sun or light. I can't believe people were living here when we were living and breathing our normal lives."" It will be hard for Syrians and their new rulers to track down the people they want to punish. Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia with his family. His brother Maher, with a reputation for violence and corruption as bad as anyone in his extended family, is thought to be in Iraq.A couple of Assad's cousins ran into rebel fighters as they tried to escape to Lebanon. One of them, according to Reuters news agency, was killed in the resulting shootout.When I entered Syria a week ago hundreds of cars full of despondent and scared families with some link to the regime, who believed they would be in danger in the new Syria, were leaving, queuing to get over the border into Lebanon. At the same time hundreds were driving in the opposite direction, desperate to get home.Eventually there might be a legal process to prosecute Bashar al-Assad, members of his family and some of those who carried guns for the regime. Gathering evidence would be part of that. But the exodus in the last hours of the regime and in the confused days and nights that followed means that it will be hard to get to the people responsible. At Saydnaya prison, families wander through the building, desperate for information, searching for those they've lost, horrified by everything they are seeing. Just being in Saydnaya's cells and corridors, freezing cold in December, reinforces a widespread desire to see the punishment of everyone implicated in the Assad regime's crimes.A group of men gathered in the prison yard, smoking silently, some leafing through files that they had picked up off the ground. All those I spoke to said that the future must be built on justice for the past. The men in the group, all looking for missing, sons, brothers and cousins, called Saydnaya a mass grave. They want the head of Bashar al-Assad, literally. They murmured agreement when one of them said he had to be decapitated.One of them, a young man called Ahmed, said he knew the brother he was searching for was alive because he could see him in his dreams. Ahmed himself had spent three years in Saydnaya.""It was so bad, the torture, the food, everything. We were suffering."" Mohammed Khalaf, an older man, had been searching for his son Jabr since he was dragged from the family breakfast table by thugs from one of the state's intelligence agencies in 2014.""We are many. People came from Qamishli, Hasaka, Deir al-Zour, Al Raqqa looking for our loved ones. Thousands are still in the streets looking for their children. It's not just me.""Inside one of the cell blocks, young men from Aleppo were warming themselves on a fire that they had lit in a metal tin, burning old prison uniforms that are scattered around every cell. They were looking for brothers who had been detained and then disappeared.Like many others looking for information or a body at Saydnaya, the men had no money for a hotel. So they camped in the prison where they believe their brothers were consigned and most likely killed. One of the men from Aleppo, Ezzedine Khalil, wants news of a brother taken by the regime on 1 September 2015. They all know the precise dates.""We don't know if he is alive or dead. If he is dead, they should give us his body. They should tell us if he's dead. We just want to know. We want to know what to do next.""His friend Mohammed Radwan was looking for a brother and a cousin who were detained in 2012. Rumours were flying around that the night before the fall of the regime, 22 freezer lorries were brought to the prison to remove bodies. The rumours have not been confirmed but Mohammed and Ezzedine were convinced that they were true.Mohammed looked exhausted and his anger flared up. He addressed himself to Assad.""Where did you, pig, take the 22 fridge trucks? Everyone who took part in this crime, and everyone who served her in Saydnaya prison should be brought to justice. Everyone! Even if they were working in cleaning. They should all be brought to account.""""Because if they knew what was happening, at least they should have told the families of the prisoners that their dear ones were killed, slaughtered, hanged or tortured.""Both men ended with an Islamic prayer: ""Allah is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs.""Their hunger to see Assad and his men punished could become one of the drivers of events in the next few months. Syrians want to see their tormentors punished. The extended Assad clan used Syria as their bank account. They helped themselves to stakes in businesses that might make profits. They controlled the lucrative market for telecoms and mobiles. As they raked in cash, Syrians struggled to eke out a living in an economy smashed by war and drained dry by rapacious and corrupt regime favourites. The new rulers of Syria have inherited big debts and an almost worthless currency. A couple of hundred dollars equals a plastic trash bag of bundles of Syrian pounds.Corruption extended to the prison system. Victims and families desperate to avoid years in a hell-hole were prepared to pay big money to stay out.Hassan Abu Shwarb served 11 years under sentence of death for terrorism, which was the word the Assad regime used for rebellion. Hassan, a quietly spoken man who is now 31, denies he ever joined an armed group. Instead, he says he was detained at a government office when he was getting documents necessary to apply for a passport so he could accept an offer to study in Canada.His brother said the family paid a total of $50,000 (£39,509) in bribes on five separate occasions to try to get him out. In all cases the corrupt officials who had offered help for cash pocketed the money without releasing Hassan. A couple of weeks before the regime collapsed yet another corrupt judge offered to free Hassan for another $50,000.After his arrest Hassan Abu Shwarb was tortured when he was detained for 80 days at a military intelligence interrogation centre. Among other injuries, the torturers broke one of his legs. Hassan says he was with one of his cellmates, a 49-year-old man, when he died after three days of torture. The jailors recorded death from a stroke.Hassan was overjoyed to get home. ""When my mother held me after 11 years, I can't describe the feeling. There is nothing like going back to your home and neighbourhood.""But like many Syrians, Hassan's optimism about the future starts with determination that the fallen regime's leaders and acolytes should suffer for their deeds.""They should be punished. We are human souls, not stones after all. And those who killed should be publicly executed. Otherwise, we won't get through this.""We need to forget and move on. This is a happiness for all Syrians. We need to return to our work and responsibility to continue. We need to forget. We turned the page. All the sadness is behind us.""The leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has started using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, instead of his war time pseudonym, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. The name change contains a message about looking ahead. The evidence is that Ahmed al-Sharaa will need to prioritise justice for the deposed regime if he does not want the chaos of people taking matters into their own hands.The future is hard, and the past is full of pain. Here in Damascus, it feels as if a collective weight has been lifted from the shoulders of a nation.Syrians know how deep their problems go. To preserve the optimism created by Assad's fall, Syrians want to see progress."
"Tourists in Fiji ill after suspected pina-colada poisoningThe four Australians, one American and two other foreigners had reportedly had cocktails at a resort bar.12 hrs agoWorld",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn08qdjwkkqo,"Seven foreigners in Fiji were sent to hospital for suspected poisoning after drinking pina coladas at a five-star resort's bar, local authorities said.Five are tourists, with one from the US and the rest from Australia, aged between 18 and 56. Two others are foreigners living in Fiji, according to local media reports citing the health ministry.Some were previously reported to be seriously ill, but local officials said on Monday that their symptoms have since improved and some were set to be discharged.The incident comes weeks after thedeaths of six tourists in the South East Asian nation of Laosbecause of suspected methanol poisoning. Fiji tourism chief Brent Hill told RNZ they were keenly aware of the Laos incident, but added that the case in Fiji was ""a long way from that"".Shortly after drinking the rum cocktail at the Warwick Fiji resort on the Coral Coast, the seven guests displayed nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms.They were initially taken to Sigatoka Hospital, and later transferred to Lautoka Hospital, according to the Fiji Times.Fiji's tourism minister Viliame Gavok has stressed that this was an ""extremely isolated incident"" and that the resort claimed ""they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests"".Initial investigations are under way and no further cases have been reported, authorities said. Sydney resident David Sandoe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that his daughter Tanya and granddaughter Georgia were among those affected. But he added they were returning home and doing ""very well"" considering what happened.""It's very difficult to take a call at 11 at night... and your daughter says that they have been poisoned and they're in hospital,"" Mr Sandoe said, adding that Georgia had suffered a seizure.The ABC had previously reported a 56-year-old Australian woman was under medical surveillance in hospital and a 19-year-old Australian woman had suffered ""serious medical episodes"".The Warwick Fiji hotel said in a statement to the BBC that it was aware of the ""suspected alcohol poisoning"" and was taking it ""very seriously"". The hotel said it was ""conducting a thorough investigation"" while awaiting a ""test result report"" from the health authorities to ""gather all necessary information"".Fiji police are said to be investigating the circumstances of the incident.Two Australian families in Fiji are receiving consular assistance, an Australian foreign ministry spokesperson told the BBC.A New Zealand foreign affairs ministry spokesperson told the BBC it had ""not received any requests for assistance"" after the apparent poisoning incident.The BBC also understands that no British persons were affected in the incident.""There's a real terrifying sense of deja vu,"" Australian minister Jason Clare told the ABC. Two 19-year-old Australian girls haddied from suspected methanol poisoning in the Laos incident.Tourists have been advised to ""be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks in Fiji"" by Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).The guidance said tourists should ""get urgent medical help if you suspect drink spiking""."
Bali Nine drug smugglers 'relieved' to be back in Australia13 hrs agoAustralia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr2l1gvg3qo,"The five remaining members of the infamous ""Bali Nine"" drug ring say they are ""relieved and happy"" to be home in Australia, after serving nearly 20 years in Indonesian prisons.Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj arrived in Darwin on Sunday following years of lobbying by Australia on their behalf.""They look forward, in time, to reintegrating back into and contributing to society,"" said a statement issued on behalf of the men and their families.The high-profile case began in 2005 when Indonesia caught nine young Australians trying to smuggle 8.3kg (18lb) of heroin out of Bali strapped to their bodies. The eight men and one woman were arrested at an airport and hotel in Bali after a tip-off from Australian police.The case made global headlines when two of the gang's ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed by firing squad in 2015 - sparking a diplomatic row between neighbours Indonesia and Australia.Other members of the Bali Nine - most of whom were aged under 21 - were handed sentences of either 20 years or life in prison.The case put a spotlight on Indonesia's strict drug laws, some of the most stringent in the world.One of the nine, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, died of cancer in prison in 2018. Shortly afterwards, Renae Lawrence, then 41, the only woman among the group, had her sentence commuted after spending almost 13 years in prison and returned to Australia the same year.Indonesia did not commute the sentences of the remaining five, now aged 38 to 48, and they were transported back to Australia as prisoners. However the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported that the men are effectively free to live unhindered in Australian society. The five are banned for life from entering Indonesia, a spokesman for the government there said in a statement.On Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken to several of the men's ""grateful"" parents.""They did a serious crime and they have rightly paid a serious price for it. But it was time for them to come home,"" he told reporters.He said the deal did not come with conditions or favours Australia would have to repay: ""This is an act of compassion by President Prabowo [Subianto] and we thank him for it.""The men and their families also said they were ""immensely grateful"" to Prabowo.They also thanked the lawyers, diplomats and government figures who had helped advocate for them over the past two decades, before asking for privacy.""The welfare of the men is a priority, they will need time and support, and we hope and trust our media and community will make allowance for this.""The five men are being put through medical checks at Darwin's Howard Springs facility - which was used for quarantine during the pandemic - and will begin a voluntary ""rehabilitation process"", Education Minister Jason Clare said. It is not clear what that entails, or how long the men will stay there.He added that normal visa processes would apply to any Indonesian family members of the men, who did not follow them to Australia.The Bishop of Townsville, Timothy Harris, who has supported the families of Scott Rush and Michael Czugaj since their arrests, said he immediately called Scott Rush's father Lee when he heard the news.Scott's parents are eagerly awaiting the reunion, Bishop Harris told the BBC.""They are mortified by what their son did.

But this turn of events [has] filled them with a sense of anticipation.""However, he said it would take time for the men to heal from their experience and re-integrate into society.""If you think that through, your son commits a crime [and was] incarcerated in a foreign country, they return. How does someone get re-integrated into the family, let alone society?""""Things have changed. The relationships need to be rekindled. They are going to have to face that as time goes on,"" he said.""Once [Scott's family] gets to embrace him...

"Telegram app recommends extremist content to users, study finds2 hrs agoTechnology",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgrvw29x4jo,"The social media platform Telegram uses an algorithm that promotes extremist content, a new study shared exclusively with the BBC has revealed.The report, from the US civil rights organisation the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), found that the ""similar channels"" feature introduced last year recommends extremist channels even to users browsing subjects such as celebrities or technology.A professor also showed BBC Panorama how he found someone within moments on Telegram who offered to ship an Uzi submachine gun to the UK for £850.Telegram says users are ""only presented with content they have chosen to engage with"" and it removes millions of pieces of harmful content daily. The company's founder, Russian billionaire Pavel Durov, is under formal investigation in France accused of failing to stop criminality on his platform.He has denied the allegations.Best known as a messaging app marketed with secretive features, Telegram also allows its almost one billion users to set up channels where they can broadcast messages and videos to up to 200,000 people at a time.SPLC researchers looked at 28,000 of these Telegram channelsfor their report Telegram's Toxic Recommendations.It found that users browsing mundane topics would be recommended extreme content - while users looking at one form of extreme content, such as anti-government conspiracies, would be pushed towards other extremist ideologies such as antisemitism or white nationalism. Lead researcher Megan Squire demonstrated how the algorithm works by searching for ""Donald Trump"" in a newly set up Telegram account.Immediately in the ""similar channels"" recommendations were multiple examples of channels promoting the Q-Anon conspiracy, which maintains with zero evidence that Mr Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media.Another search for ""UK riots"" showed a meme about Adolf Hitler as the first result, followed by suggestions for a series of channels run by violent far-right groups. ""Some of these groups are pretty active. You're not just on Telegram getting memes, you're getting shuffled into to actual events. They're having events on the ground with people showing up,"" Ms Squire said.In the hours after the Southport knife attack in August, which prompted riots, Telegram users posted some of the first calls for protest, along with false claims the suspected attacker was an asylum seeker.Ms Squire told BBC Panorama that the research showed Telegram had become a ""digital threat"".""On a scale of one to 10, Telegram I would say is an 11. It's dishing out enormous amounts of criminal content, extremist content. It is extremely dangerous in my opinion,"" she said. A former insider who was part of Telegram's inner circle for seven years, Elies Campo, told Panorama that he had challenged Pavel Durov about extreme material in 2021.""His stance was it's not up to a platform like us to decide who should be speaking out. It was clear that he didn't want to dedicate more resources to it,"" Mr Campo said.""I think if he could choose, he would choose more a stand where he doesn't have to moderate anything.""Prof David Maimon from Georgia State University, who has spent six years studying illegal content on Telegram, said there were tens of thousands of channels offering everything from tools for scammers to guns. ""Telegram is definitely one of the most important platforms criminals are using now for criminality,"" he said.He showed Panorama how within moments of posting a message saying he needed ""an Uzi and a shotgun"", a seller posted a picture of an Uzi and said he could ""get it fast-tracked"" to the programme's address in Belfast within two or three days.The French authorities have accused Pavel Durov of complicity in drug dealing, organised crime and sharing child abuse images on Telegram. He is currently on bail and is not allowed to leave France.Telegram says it takes extremist and illegal content very seriously and its moderation teams and AI tool remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.It says its users only receive the content to which they have subscribed - as Telegram does not ""inject or promote content"".""The 'channel suggestions' feature shows only channels with the same topic as those a user already follows. This approach ensures that users are only presented with content they have chosen to engage with. This is completely different from how other platforms make suggestions,"" the company said.Telegram said ''it does not amplify content, but instead shows topic-based suggestions tied to user choices""."
South Korea court begins Yoon's impeachment trial process13 hrs agoAsia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pl4edk13o,"South Korea's constitutional court has begun trial proceedings for the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was suspended for declaring martial law and plunging his country into political turmoil.MPs voted to impeach Yoon last Saturday, after his actions sparked widespread protests calling for him to step down.The court now has six months to decide whether to remove Yoon or reinstate him.Yoon's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has been grappling with the fallout ever since, with its leader announcing his resignation on Monday. While public hearings for Yoon's impeachment trial could take months, the court is under pressure to decide quickly and bring an end to political uncertainty. Protesters have vowed to keep up their calls for Yoon's removal during court proceedings.In the previous two instances a South Korean president faced impeachment, the court reversed one decision and upheld the other.There had been questions on whether the trial could proceed in Yoon's case, as the court currently only has six justices out of nine. Three retired recently and have yet to be replaced.But the court said on Monday it could run Yoon's trial with just six judges, and set a preliminary hearing date for 27 December.If the court upholds impeachment in Yoon's case, the country must hold fresh presidential elections within 60 days. In the meantime, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo is serving as acting president.It is unclear if Yoon will take the stand himself during the court hearings.He ignored a summons to meet prosecutors in Seoul on Sunday, and is set to be ordered in again for questioning. If he fails to come forward this week, police may move to arrest him.Yoon has defended his decision to impose martial law, and after his impeachment  he once againsaid he would fight until the end.Minutes after the constitutional court convened on Monday morning, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon announced his resignation. ""I sincerely apologise to all the people who are suffering from this emergency situation,"" Han said in a televised press conference.Han has faced growing calls for his resignation particularly from the large pro-Yoon faction of his party, following the president's impeachment.Han had initially tried to stage an orderly exit for Yoon. But when it became clear that Yoon was not backing down,Han did an about-face and called for his impeachment, saying it was the only way to remove him from office.On Saturday, 12 PPP lawmakers were believed to have voted for impeachment, enabling the motion to pass. But most of the other PPP lawmakers voted against Yoon's impeachment.All five Supreme Council members of the PPP said after the vote that they would resign - which would automatically dissolve the party leadership.As the Supreme Council has been ""destroyed"", Han said, it was now ""impossible"" to serve his duties as party chief.""While it pains me to think of my heartbroken supporters, I don't regret it,"" Han said, in reference to his decision to call for Yoon's impeachment."
Canada's finance minister quits over Trump tariff dispute with Trudeau3 hrs agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2elggj813o,"Canada's Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland has resigned from her post, citing disagreements with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on how to respond to incoming President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs.She announced her resignation in a letter to Trudeau on Monday, in which she said the two have been ""at odds about the best path forward for Canada"", and pointed to the ""grave challenge"" posed by Trump's policy of ""aggressive economic nationalism"".Freeland said the decision comes after Trudeau informed her last week that he no longer wanted her to be his government's top economic adviser.Her resignation came hours before she was due to provide an annual fiscal government update in parliament. In recent days, the two have also reportedly been in a dispute over a policy that would have delivered a C$250 ($175; £139) cheque to every eligible Canadian.The BBC has reached out to the prime minister's office and the finance department for comment.In her publicly-shared resignation letter, Freeland said Canada needs to keep its ""fiscal powder dry"" to deal with the threat of sweeping tariffs from US President-elect Donald Trump.She added this means ""eschewing costly political gimmicks"" that Canada cannot afford.Trump has promised to imposea levy of 25% on imported Canadian goods, which economists have warned would significantly hurt Canada's economy.Referencing the tariffs, Freeland called them a ""threat"" that needs to be taken ""extremely seriously"".She added that this means ""pushing back against 'America First' economic nationalism"" and working with unity in response to these tariff threats.Freeland and Trudeau were reportedly in disagreement over a series of recently-proposed policies by the prime minister designed to address the country's cost-of-living crisis.Among them is a cheque of C$250 that the government wanted to send to every Canadian earning less than C$150,000 annually. These cheques were expected to cost the federal government a total of C$4.68bn.Another is a temporary tax break on essential items during the holidays which is anticipated to cost C$1.6bn in lost tax revenue.Freeland's office had reportedly been concerned about the price of these two policies, saying they are economically unwise at a time when the country's deficit is growing.The tax holiday has since been approved in the House of Commons, but the C$250-cheques hit a hurdle when the New Democratic Party - a centre-left party in parliament - signalled it would not lend its support to the policy unless it is expanded.A poll bythe Angus Reid Institute showed that four out of five Canadians viewed the cheques as a political movedesigned to win public goodwill as Trudeau's popularity plummets.Freeland, who also holds the position of deputy prime minister, has long been one of Trudeau's closest allies within his Liberal party. She has held the key role of Canada's finance minister since 2020, helping to lead the country through the pandemic and its aftermath.She replaced former Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who also resigned from his post amid a dispute with Trudeau over government spending policies, as well as conflict-of-interest allegations he faced involving a youth charity.Other members of the Liberal party's cabinet have since reacted to her resignation.""These are difficult and deeply personal decisions and obviously she's made that decision and I respect her for it,"" said Patty Hajdu, Canada's minister for indigenous relations.Minister of Transport Anita Anand described Freeland as a ""good friend,"" and added: ""This news has hit me really hard and I'll reserve further comment until I have time to process it.""It is unclear if the fall economic statement will be delivered on Monday as planned in light of Freeland's resignation. A government official told Reuters news agency that the finance ministry is determining next steps.Canada's public broadcaster CBC reported that Freeland's resignation was not expected today, citing a senior federal government source.Freeland said she intends to stay on as a Liberal member of parliament, and that she will run again in Canada's upcoming election, which must be held on or before October.Her resignation comes after another cabinet member, housing minister Sean Fraser, announced he will not be seeking re-election, saying he wants to spend more time with his family."
"Fear of a reckoning simmers in Assad's Alawite heartlandQuentin Sommerville is on patrol with HTS in Latakia, as they pledge to protect minorities.27 mins agoMiddle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8nzjkye42o,"Noor stands trembling in the chill afternoon light of the courtyard, not from the cold, but from fear.Dressed in her thick winter coat, she has come to make a complaint to the men of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Syria's new de-facto rulers, and the new law in town.She begins to cry as she explains that three days earlier, just before nine in the evening, armed men had arrived in a black van at her apartment in an upscale neighbourhood of the city of Latakia. Along with her children and her husband, an army officer, she was forced out onto the street in her pyjamas. The leader of the armed men then moved his own family into her home. Noor - not her real name - is Alawite, the minority sect from which the Assad family originates, and to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged. Alawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni. Latakia, on Syria's north-west Mediterranean coast is their heartland.As with other cities, an array of different rebel groups have rushed into the power vacuum left after Assad's soldiers abandoned their posts. The regime had exploited sectarian divisions to maintain its grip on power, now the Sunni Islamist HTS has pledged to respect all religions in Syria. But Latakia's Alawite population is fearful.Some people haven't even left their homes since the regime change because they worry that there will be a reckoning, and that they will have to pay a heavy price for the support of the old regime.Noor shows CCTV footage from her apartment, to 34-year-old Abu Ayoub, HTS general security commander. In the film, a group of bearded fighters, some wearing baseball caps and others in military fatigues, is pictured on her doorstep. They are not from HTS, she says, but another group, rebels from the northern city of Aleppo.""They broke down the door. There were 10 militants at our door and 16 others waiting down the street with three cars,"" Noor tells Abu Ayoub. His men are mostly from Idlib and Aleppo, where the HTS and allied rebel factions were based before launching the offensive that overthew Assad three weeks ago. They stand around in combat fatigues, holding their rifles and listening intently as she describes how the family's belongings were thrown into the street.HTS was once aligned with al-Qaeda and is still proscribed as a terror organisation by most Western countries, although the UK and US say they have been in contact with the group. In a matter of weeks, it has gone from enemy of the state to the law of the land. Abu Ayoub and his men are adjusting to the change in roles from revolutionaries to policemen.Noor is only one of a long line of complainants who have come to their general security station with grievances. The base, the city's former military intelligence headquarters, was perhaps the most feared place in Latakia. Now it is a shambles, with broken radios and equipment scattered across the courtyard. Torn portraits of Bashar al-Assad lie in the dirt.A man joins the queue of those making complaints. He has a black eye, broken ribs, and his shirt is torn and bloodied. He says men from Idlib had broken into his apartment. ""Some of them were civilians, some wore military clothes and were masked,"" he says. ""They hit my daughter and aimed weapons at my son's head. They stole money, they stole gold.""Every call-out here is a show of force, especially with so many armed groups in the city. With the man's son directing them, the HTS security force drives to one of the poorer neighbourhoods, weaving through a warren of back streets, past scrapyards and middens.The armed police take up positions along the street and at the doorway of the apartment. They bring two suspects back to the station for questioning.But they barely have time to clear their weapons when there is another complaint, a dispute over gas bottles that left another man beaten.He says three men had pulled guns on him. Another race in the cars to a crowded commercial and residential neighbourhood. When the police pull a suspect out into the street - his face still bloody from the earlier fight - local women come to their balconies and shout ""Shabiha! Shabiha!"". They are accusing the suspect of being a member of the shadowy militia force, mostly made of Alawite men, who did the Assad regime's dirty work.Since its lightning-fast sweep to victory across Syria, Islamist HTS has pledged to keep the peace and protect all of the country's minorities. And every day Abu Ayoub has to make good on that pledge.""Some infiltrators into the revolution, some saboteurs, and some weak-minded people are taking advantage of the situation in the areas that were recently liberated,"" he says.Abu Ayoub admits the situation in the city was ""a bit chaotic"" but turns his attention to Noor. ""We are here now, we weren't here when the army left. We were initially in Damascus and then we came. They are thugs, and we will evict them from your house. We will return your belongings. You have my word,"" he said. And with that he orders his men into their pickup trucks and with sirens blaring they head for the apartment. Latakia is a city liberated. Last Friday, tens of thousands of people from all sects, gathered on the streets to celebrate the downfall of the Assad dynasty. In a city square, they sat atop the plinth where the statue of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father - who ruled for 29 years before his death in 2000 - once stood, and joyfully waved the flag of a free Syria.The message that day was unity, of one Syria, without sectarian division. But after half a century of tyrannical rule from a regime which fanned sectarian hatred and warned that Alawites would be massacred if they ever lost power, it is an adjustment to say the least.On Saturday, three HTS fighters were killed, and 14 injured outside the city, in what it said was gun battle with a criminal gang. HTS, which is trying to maintain calm, claims there was no sectarian element to the attack.On the way to Noor's apartment, the HTS convoy speed through the streets and passersby cheer them and flash the peace sign. The new Syrian flag, with its green instead of red stripe, and three red stars instead of two green, is commonplace on shop shutters and hanging from balconies. But in Alawite areas, people mostly watch in silence as the convoy moves along. There are fewer new flags in evidence.Azam al-Ali, 28, an HTS security officer from Deir al-Sour in eastern Syria sits in the front seat. After so much oppression, he says, it will take time for people to trust authority again.""Most of the oppressed that come with complaints are from two sects, the Sunni and the Alawite. We do not differentiate. But the extreme poverty that this regime left behind caused this vast chaos,"" he tells me as the traffic parts for the convoy.And he notes that Alawites, some of whom were among the poorest in Syria, suffered too under the Assad regime.We arrive at Noor's apartment and half a dozen armed HTS men hurry up the stairs. The woman behind the door refuses to open up, but after some negotiation the door opens, and she and her family are ordered to leave. Noor goes in to retrieve some clothes and books for her daughter who is studying for exams. Weapons and ammunition belonging to the rebel squatters are confiscated.""When I went to HTS today I was terrified,"" says Noor. ""Their appearance was so intimidating and frightening. Honestly, though, they were very nice.""But she won't be returning to the apartment. One nightmare has ended in Syria, and for Alawites, another has begun, she says.As she clutches her belongings, Noor says she no longer feels safe in her home.""It's impossible for me to live here again. I do have hope, but not in the near future. At the moment I don't dare."""
Yang Tengbo: Who is alleged Chinese spy linked to Prince Andrew?A court order which gave Yang anonymity was lifted on Monday following a long-running legal battle with the Home Office.2 hrs agoAsia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dx1yzzerlo,"Yang Tengbo, also known as Chris Yang, is the 50-year-old Chinese businessman with links to Prince Andrew banned from the UK last year because he was judged as a risk to national security.UK authorities have alleged he is a Chinese spy whoformed an ""unusual degree of trust""with the Duke of York and built relationships with politicians. Prince Andrew said he had""ceased all contact"" with Yangand that ""nothing of a sensitive nature"" was discussed.He was previously referred to as H6 but a court order concealing his identity was lifted on Monday. Yang has said he is not a spy and the media reports of him as such are ""entirely untrue"".""Due to the high level of speculation and misreporting in the media and elsewhere, I have asked my legal team to disclose my identity,"" a statement read. ""I have done nothing wrong or unlawful and the concerns raised by the Home Office against me are ill-founded.""FOLLOW LIVE: Alleged Chinese spy with links to Prince Andrew named as Yang TengboYang - who had spent more than 20 years in the UK and held residence rights - appealed against the government's decision to ban him from the country last year arguing his sudden exclusion was unlawful and unfair.A Special Immigration Appeals Tribunal upheld the ban, saying in its published ruling last week that there was sufficient evidence to suggest he was a risk to national security. There are several details known about him from that case. Yang was born in China in 1974, where he studied at university and then worked as a junior civil servant for some years.In 2002, he came to the UK where he studied language in London for one year and then took a masters degree in public policy at the University of York.He told the tribunal he had originally intended to return to China to continue his career in the public sector, but saw opportunities for bridging the gap between China and the UK.In 2005 he founded a company which provided travel and tourism services. That company, Hampton Group International. Yang remains listed as director of the company.On 21 May 2013 he was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. He told the tribunal he has since divided life pretty evenly between the UK and China, and prior to the Covid pandemic had on average spent up to two weeks in the UK each month.He considered the UK to be his ""second home"", he told the tribunal. On 6 November 2021, Yang was stopped at the UK border under counter-terrorism laws for undisclosed reasons. He was required to surrender his phone and other digital devices.In February 2022, he filed a legal claim to stop the UK government from retaining his data - a bid he first won and then lost on appeal.During that legal battle he was informed for the first time that UK authorities believed he was associated with the United Front Work Department (UFWD) – the secretive arm of the Chinese government that organises its cultural influence operations overseas and has been linked to several cases of alleged Chinese state interference overseas.In mid-February 2023, Yang was ""off-boarded"" from a flight to London as he was returning from Beijing. He was told then UK authorities were in the process of making a decision to bar him from the country.Yang's lawyers on 9 March 2023 asked the government to disclose the reasons and allegations for this move, and the opportunity to make his case prior to any decision being made.Six days later, then Home Secretary Suella Braverman ordered the cancellation of Yang's residency rights and banned him from the UK on the basis it would be ""conducive to the public good"".Yang was informed of this decision in a letter on 23 March 2023. In April, he launched a case challenging the ban on the basis the decision was unlawful and procedurally unfair. Authorities have relied on the data taken from Yang's digital devices at the border stop in 2021.It included documents which UK authorities said indicated a link between Yang, the UFWD and other Beijing-linked groups.UK authorities argued Yang had ""sometimes deliberately obscured"" his links to the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party and the UFWD.The Home Office said letters and documents found in his possession suggested he was ""frequently connected to officials connected with the Chinese state"" and alleged there was a ""deceptive element"" to how he had presented his links.They also said Yang had honorary membership of the 48 Group Club - a London-based group aimed at promoting trade between the UK and China. The 70-year-old group has counted former Prime Minister Tony Blair and other senior UK politicians.Security officials argued that Yang's membership of the club, ""which has a number of prominent UK figures as members"", could be leveraged for political interference purposes by China.In a response to the US-funded Radio Free Asia media group on the weekend, the 48 Group Club said Yang was never actively involved the running of the group.The tribunal judges said some of the evidence may have had an ""innocent explanation"" but said there was ""sufficient"" material to justify MI5's conclusion Yang posed a national security risk, despite saying it had been a ""finely balanced"" decision. Those documents showed Yang had received a letter from a senior adviser to Prince Andrew, Dominic Hampshire, who had confirmed to Yang he could act on behalf of the prince in engagements with potential partners and investors in China.Mr Hampshire also told Yang in a letter: ""Outside of [the prince's] closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on.""It is unclear if this was a true assertion put forward by Mr Hampshire, who has not spoken publicly since being named in the ruling.But the Home Office assessed this as evidence that Yang was in a position to ""generate relationships between prominent UK figures and senior Chinese officials"" which ""could be leveraged for political interference purposes"" by Beijing.A document listing ""main talking points"" for a call with Prince Andrew was also found.It stated: ""IMPORTANT: Manage expectations. Really important to not set 'too high' expectations - he is in a desperate situation and will grab onto anything.""Judges also argued that Yang had ""downplayed"" his links with the UFWD, which they said ""combined with his relationship with the Duke represented a threat to national security"".Prince Andrew said he ""ceased all contact"" with Yang after receiving advice from the government, but did not specify when communication stopped.In a statement, his office said the prince had met Yang ""through official channels"" and there was ""nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed"". Yang has strongly denied the allegations against him. In his first submission to the tribunal appealing against his ban, he said he had avoided getting involved in politics and had no connections to anyone in politics in China.In further submissions, he said he only had limited links to the Chinese State and that ""contact with the UFWD is unavoidable"".Yang said he had never been a member of the Chinese Communist Party and had never carried out activities on its behalf for for the UFWD. He said the ban was damaging to his personal life and business.China's embassy in the UK has denied the espionage claim, saying ""some individuals in the UK are always eager to fabricate baseless 'spy' stories targeting China"".""Their purpose is to smear China and disrupt normal exchanges between Chinese and British personnel,"" a spokesperson for the embassy said on Friday."
Murder and mayhem: The story of Glasgow's deadly gang feudA gangland feud which dates back more than 20 years is the focus of a new BBC Radio 5 Live true crime podcast.13 hrs agoGlasgow & West Scotland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20e6g5xdx9o,"On the afternoon of 6 December 2006, two men in a blue Mazda pulled up outside a garage in Lambhill, in the north of Glasgow.Raymond Anderson and James McDonald put on old man face masks before stepping out of the car.What happened next was later likened by defence lawyer Donald Findlay KC to ""a scene from The Godfather"".Dressed in trench coats, the pair walked into Applerow Motors, off the busy Balmore Road, and opened fire. The owner, David Lyons, took cover but his 21-year-old nephew Michael was shot dead.Steven Lyons, David's nephew, was injured along with his associate Robert Pickett, who lost a kidney.The hitmen were enforcers for the Daniel crime clan, believed by police to be led by Jamie Daniel.The Daniels were locked in a bitter battle with the Lyons family, who were based in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire.A bloody gangland feud which had largely been conducted in the shadows was now headline news.The deadly rivalry, which dates back more than 20 years, is now the focus of a new BBC Radio 5 Live true crime podcast.Gangster: The Daniels and the Lyons chronicles the savage battle for control of Glasgow's drugs trade.The six-part series also details the fall-out from multiple shootings and countless tit-for-tat attacks. Ten days after the murder, David Lyons received a ""ransom note"" through the post.It read: ""The boys owe me £25,000 and I want what's owed to me. It's for drugs.""They all know what it's about as they have got to pay the piper.""The High Court in Glasgow later heard that Mr Lyons did not pay the money and instead handed the letter to police.Anderson and McDonald were placed under surveillance which eventually led officers to a house in the Garthamlock area where a machine gun, grenades and ammunition were discovered. Both men were heard calling themselves ""The Untouchables"" and talking about the mysterious ""piper"", who was mentioned in the letter sent to Mr Lyons.They were also linked to military weapons which had been stolen from army barracks.In May 2008 Anderson, 49, and McDonald, 27, were convicted and each sentenced to 35 years in jail, which waslater reduced on appeal.The judge, Lord Hardie, described the killing as a ""cold-blooded, premeditated assassination"".The murder was rooted in a feud said to date back to 2001 when a £20,000 stash of cocaine disappeared from a Daniel safe house in Milton, in the north of Glasgow, during a party. Graeme Pearson, former director general of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, told the podcast: ""It was alleged that members of the Lyons family group stole a delivery of drugs that were due for the Daniel family and there had been a real upset about the theft of those drugs.""Equally, it was alleged that the Lyons family had decided that they were also retailing in the north side [of Glasgow], where the Daniel family traditionally had the upper hand.""This was their territory. This was where they made profit and they wouldn't stand for it. That couldn't go without some response.""The fall-out from the missing drugs rapidly progressed from car chases to shootings.Among the early victims were Kevin ""Gerbil"" Carroll - a major figure in the Daniel clan - and Johnny Lyons, brother of David and Eddie Snr.Both were shot and injured in separate attacks just 11 days apart in January 2003.Then, in November 2006, Carroll allegedly used a 4x4 and a tow rope to topple the headstone of Eddie Snr's son Garry, who was only eight when he died of leukaemia in 1991.The desecration of his grave marked a new low.Days later Carroll ambushed and shot Eddie Lyons Jnr and a friend in Bellshill, Lanarkshire.But a week later he was injured in a retaliatory shooting in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire.Police were deploying significant resources in a bid to manage the dispute but the violence was escalating. It was no secret that Carroll was the most unpredictable player in the whole feud.His rivalry with the Lyons clan stretched back to his schooldays when he was reportedly bullied by members of the family.Carroll, who earned his nickname from a character in the TV puppet series Roland Rat, later forged close friendships with the Daniel clan.Aged 19 he was jailed for three months for car theft and by his mid-20s he was a major criminal player on the north side of Glasgow.In 2004 he was charged with trying to kill a friend of Eddie Lyons Snr with an AK-47 but the trial later collapsed.Carroll - who shared a £217,000 house with Jamie Daniel's daughter in Lennoxtown - could have been forgiven for thinking he was above the law.By 2009 he was out of control and struck fear into rivals by masterminding a series of""alien abductions""across central Scotland.The kidnappings were described in such a way as the victims, who were tortured and robbed, told police they couldn't remember anything about their ordeal.Carroll's brutality and pattern of offending ensured he had many enemies and he went to great lengths to cover his tracks.If his rivals wanted to target him then they would have to stage an audacious ambush unlike anything that had gone before. On 13 January 2010 Carroll attended a lunchtime business meeting at Asda in Robroyston, Glasgow.Days earlier he had shot and injured Eddie Lyons Jnr on the arm.Now Carroll had arranged to poach drug pusher Stephen Glen, who was linked to the Lyons family.A trial later heard Carroll, 29, told him: ""You're working for me now. Anybody that doesn't fall into line is going to get banged.""But at 13:23, minutes after delivering the ultimatum, he was sitting in the back of a black Audi A3 when a speeding Volkswagen Golf screeched to a halt in front of the vehicle.Carroll's two associates fled leaving him trapped in the back of the three-door car.Two masked men emerged from the Golf and opened fire, shattering the rear passenger windows.Carroll was shot in the head and chest - 13 times in total - in an attack that lasted 25 seconds. William ""Buff"" Paterson, fled to Spain 10 days after the murder and later featured in a10 most wanted appealby the then UK Serious Organised Crime Agency.But after more than four years on the run he eventuallyhanded himself inat a police station in Madrid.During his trial, at the High Court in Glasgow, Carroll's notoriety was highlighted when a list of99 potential suspectswas read out.Paterson was later convicted andjailed for 22 years.The judge, Lord Armstrong, told him: ""It was not a spontaneous event which happened on the spur of the moment, it was in effect an execution."" The murder, which was committed in front of horrified lunchtime shoppers, was arguably the most public gangland hit ever carried out in Scotland.It also paved the way for further brazen attacks.In September 2015Ross Sherlock was shotas he walked down a lane from St Helen's Primary School in Bishopbriggs.At the time the kitchen fitter was chatting to another parent as their daughters walked hand-in-hand in front.Two men were later cleared of the attempted murder.And in January 2017,Ross Monaghan was shotoutside St George's Primary School in Penilee, shortly after dropping his daughter off at school.Five years earlier, he had beenacquitted of murderingCarroll after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence.Two men later went on trial for the Monaghan murder bid but were cleared only to be later convicted of other organised crime offences. In between the school shootings there was another major development.Jamie Daniel, who became a millionaire after starting out as a scrap metal dealer in Possil, died of cancer in July 2016.The convicted heroin smuggler made his fortune through drugs and, latterly, counterfeit cigarettes.But his death, at the age of 58, left a power vacuum and the future of his crime group was cast into doubt.There was no obvious successor, especially as his son Zander Sutherland was serving a 13-and-a-half-year jail term for heroin dealing.Sutherland later fled the UK while on day release from prison and is now in Norway fighting extradition. Meanwhile, the Lyons group responded to Daniel's death with a brutal campaign of intimidation against his associates, which included five attempted murders in five months.Robert Danielwas the first target.On 8 December 2016 his car was rammed by another vehicle before he was chased into a house in Robroyston.Once inside he was struck twice on the back of the head with what he later told police was a hatchet or a machete.Asked in court if he was aware of any ill-feeling between the Daniel and Lyons families, Robert, 29, replied: ""Not that I know of.""A month laterThomas Bilsland, 31, suffered a fractured skull after he was set upon in Glasgow's Cranhill.The next victim, Gary Petty, was targeted after he visited an Italian restaurant on 7 March 2017.A court heard the 22-year-old was getting out his Volkswagen Golf when he was ambushed in Maryhill.Ryan Fitzsimmons, 34, was attacked by a masked gang on 28 April 2017 outside his home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire.The former soldier, who was left brain damaged, told the trial: ""It felt like death was coming.""His mother Geraldine, 61, was so affected by what happened that she suffered a heart attack in the street.Mr Fitzsimmons told jurors he had ""no enemies"" but jurors heard his older brother was once charged with shooting Ross Monaghan, the man cleared of murdering Carroll in 2010. The most savage crime on the 13-page indictment was the assault onStephen ""Bonzo"" Danielon 18 May 2017.As he headed home after dropping off friends his Skoda Octavia was deliberately hit by a Volkswagen Golf in Milton.An Audi S3 soon joined the chase through north Glasgow during which the vehicles involved reach speeds of up to 100mph.Daniel's car eventually crashed on an off ramp of the M8 in the Port Dundas area.The impact left him unconscious and the 39-year-old later told a court he had no memory of what happened next.As he lay slumped at the wheel Daniel was subjected to a horrific attack with bladed weapons which left him with facial wounds so severe that first responders initially thought he had been shot.The court also heard the ex-taxi firm director's car was found to have had a tracking device on it but he insisted he had no enemies before the incident. Gangland investigations pose a massive challenge for law enforcement as detectives are typically met with a wall of silence.But the sophisticated technology deployed by the Lyons group to plot the attacks also enabled officers to build a case against them.And in May 2019 six associates of the family werejailed for a total of 104 yearsafter being found guilty of five murder plots.The judge, Lord Mulholland, told the gang: ""You sought to turn Glasgow into a war zone for your feud.""This is a civilised city, which is based on the rule of law.""There is no place for this type of conduct, retribution or the law of the jungle.""Five years on, the feud - which has also been linked to a number of prison attacks - is back in the spotlight.And presenter Livvy Haydock described the new podcast as the ""most bloody and brutal"" Gangster series to date.She added: ""This investigation has been eye-opening and uncovers the story of two of Glasgow's most notorious crime families.""It's a vicious war which has raged on for 20 years and is still going on to this day.""Gangster: The Daniels and the Lyonsis available as a boxset on BBC Sounds and on other platforms weekly."
"Why a nation of 1.45 billion wants more childrenIndia, the world's most populous country, is seeing a debate about having more babies.19 hrs agoAsia",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9088men9xo,"Last year, India nudged past China to become the world's most populous country, according to UN estimates.With nearly 1.45 billion people now, you'd think the country would be quiet about having more children. But guess what? The chatter has suddenly picked up.Leaders of two southern states – Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu – have recently advocated more children.Andhra Pradesh is mulling providing incentives, citing low fertility rates and ageing population. The state alsoscrapped its ""two-child policy""for local body elections, andreportssay neighbouring Telangana may soon do the same. Next-door Tamil Nadu is also makingsimilar, more exaggerated, noises.India's fertility rate has fallen substantially - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to the current rate of two.Fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of two births per woman in 17 of the 29 states and territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a stable population.)The five southern Indian states lead India's demographic transition, achieving replacement-level fertility well ahead of others. Kerala reached the milestone in 1988, Tamil Nadu in 1993, and the rest by the mid-2000s. Today, the five southern states have total fertility rates below 1.6, with Karnataka at 1.6 and Tamil Nadu at 1.4. In other words, fertility rates in these states match or are less than many European countries.But these states fear that India's shifting demographics with varying population shares between states, will significantly impact electoral representation and state wise-allocation of parliamentary seats and federal revenues.""They fear being penalised for their effective population control policies, despite being better economic performers and contributing significantly to federal revenues,"" Srinivas Goli, a professor of demography at the International Institute for Population Sciences, told the BBC.Southern states are also grappling with another major concern as India prepares for its firstdelimitationof electoral seats in 2026 - the first since 1976.This exercise will redraw electoral boundaries to reflect population shifts, likely reducing parliamentary seats for the economically prosperous southern states. As federal revenues are allocated based on state populations, many fear this could deepen their financial struggles and limit policy-making freedom.Demographers KS James and Shubhra Kritiprojectthat populous northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar stand to gain more seats from delimitation, while southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh could face losses, further shifting political representation.Many, including Prime MinisterNarendra Modi, have hinted that changes to fiscal shares and parliamentary seat allocations will not be rushed through. ""As a demographer, I don't think states should be overly concerned about these issues. They can be resolved through constructive negotiations between federal and state governments,"" says Mr Goli. ""My concern lies elsewhere.""The key challenge, according to demographers, is India's rapid ageing driven by declining fertility rates. While countries like France and Sweden took 120 and 80 years respectively to double their aging population from 7% to 14%, India is expected to reach this milestone in just 28 years, says Mr Goli.This accelerated ageing is tied to India's unique success in fertility decline. In most countries, improved living standards, education, and urbanisation naturally lower fertility as child survival improves.But in India, fertility rates fell rapidly despite modest socio-economic progress, thanks to aggressive family welfare programmes that promoted small families through targets, incentives, and disincentives.The unintended consequence? Take Andhra Pradesh, for instance. Its fertility rate is 1.5, on par with Sweden, but its per capita income is 28 times lower, says Mr Goli. Withmounting debtand limited resources, can states like these support higher pensions or social security for a rapidly aging population?Consider this. More than 40% of elderly Indians (60+ years) belong to the poorest wealth quintile - the bottom 20% of a population in terms of wealth distribution, according to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)'s latestIndia Ageing Report.In other words, Mr Goli says, ""India is getting old before getting rich"".Fewer children also mean a rising old-age dependency ratio, leaving fewer caregivers for an expanding elderly demographic. Demographers warn that India's healthcare, community centres and old-age homes are unprepared for this shift. Urbanisation, migration, and changing labour markets are further eroding traditional family support - India's strong point - leaving more elderly people behind.While migration from populous to less populous states can ease the working-age gap, it also sparks anti-migration anxieties. ""Robust investments in prevention, palliative care, and social infrastructure are urgently needed to look after the ageing,"" says  Mr Goli.As if the southern states' concerns weren't enough, earlier this month, the chief of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteers' Organisation), the ideological backbone of Mr Modi's BJP -  urged couples to have at least three children to secure India's future. ""According to population science, when growth falls below 2.1, a society perishes on its own. Nobody destroys it,"" Mohan Bhagwat reportedly said at a recentmeeting.While Mr Bhagwat's concerns may have some basis, they are not entirely accurate, say demographers. Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics, told the BBC that after a decade or two, continuing ""very low levels of fertility will lead to rapid population decline"".A fertility rate of 1.8 births per woman leads to a slow, manageable population decline. But a rate of 1.6 or lower could trigger ""rapid, unmanageable population decline"". ""Smaller numbers of people will enter the reproductive - and main working - ages, and this will be socially, politically and economically disastrous. This is a demographic process and it is extremely difficult to reverse,"" says Mr Dyson.This is already happening in some countries.In May, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared the country's record-low birth rate a""national emergency""and announced plans for a dedicated government ministry. Greece'sfertility rate has plummeted to 1.3, half of what it was in 1950, sparking warnings from Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about an ""existential"" population threat.But demographers say that urging people to have more children is futile. ""Considering the societal shifts, including the significant reduction in gender disparities as women's lives have become increasingly similar to those of men, this trend is unlikely to reverse,"" says Mr Dyson.WATCH:Why do some in India want couples to have more children?For Indian states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, grappling with a declining workforce, the key question is: who will step in to fill the gap? Developed countries, unable to reverse declining fertility, are focusing on healthy and active ageing - prolonging working life by five to seven years and enhancing productivity in older populations.Demographers say India will need to extend retirement ages meaningfully, and policies must prioritise increasing healthy years through better health screenings, and stronger social security to ensure an active and productive older population - a potential""silver dividend"".India must also leverage its demographic dividend better - economic growth that occurs when a country has a large, working-age population. Mr Goli believes there's a window of opportunity until 2047 to boost the economy, create jobs for the working-age population, and allocate resources for the ageing. ""We're only reaping 15-20% of the dividend - we can do much better,"" he says. The headline of this piece was updated to better reflect the story."
"In pictures: Celebrating 100 years of the 'greatest showman of Indian cinema'India marks the centenary of Raj Kapoor, who would have turned 100 on Saturday, with celebratory events.3 days agoAsia",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ldjz1q700o,"Raj Kapoor, fondly called the ""greatest showman of Indian cinema"", was a leading filmmaker, producer and actor whose work continues to shape and inspire Indian films.Today, almost four decades after his death in 1988, he remains one of India's most-loved stars.Kapoor began his film career in India's post-independence era. His early work often carried a socialistic undertone, mirroring the country's mood and aspirations of the time.""Kapoor brought romance, sexuality, song and soul to Indian socialism,"" said historian Sunil Khilnani, inIncarnations:India in 50 Lives, a 2015 BBC Radio 4 series on the men and women who made India.So perhaps it isn't surprising that celebrations to mark what would have been his 100th birthday on Saturday are taking place across the country, honouring his enduring legacy.Among them is a retrospective showcasing 10 of his iconic films that will screen across 40 cities and 135 cinemas in India at the weekend. Born as Shrishti Nath Kapoor to actors Prithviraj Kapoor and Ramsarni Kapoor, he later took the name of Ranbir Raj Kapoor and debuted as a child actor in Inquilab (1935).Before making waves on screen, Kapoor honed his craft behind the scenes - assisting filmmaker Kidar Sharma, working as an art director at his father's Prithvi Theatre, and appearing in smaller roles.His breakout came with Neel Kamal (1947), launching a storied career that combined artistic ambition with mass appeal. In 1948, Kapoor founded the iconic RK Films studio, synonymous with blockbuster films and international acclaim.He debuted as a director with Aag (1948) and showcased his versatility as an actor and filmmaker in landmark films like Barsaat (1949), Awaara (1951), Shree 420 (1955), and Sangam (1964). Other popular works include Mera Naam Joker (1970), Bobby (1973), Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978), and Ram Teri Ganga Maili (1985).All pictures courtesy of RK Films and Film Heritage Foundation"
"UK unlawfully detained migrants on Diego Garcia, judge findsSri Lankan Tamil migrants were held in a camp on the Indian Ocean island, which is the site of a secretive UK-US military base.5 hrs agoAsia",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpe7721qwo,"Sri Lankan Tamil migrants were unlawfully detained for years on the remote British territory of Diego Garcia, a judge has ruled.In 2021, dozens of Tamils became the first people ever to claim asylum on the Indian Ocean island, which is the site of a secretive UK-US military base.They were held for years in a small fenced-off camp,before being brought to the UK earlier this monthin what the government described as a ""one-off"" move in the interests of their welfare.Reacting to the ruling, lawyer Simon Robinson with UK firm Duncan Lewis representing some of the migrants, said ""questions need to be answered about how, in the 21st century, this was able to happen"". The BBC has contacted the government for comment.The ruling follows a landmark hearing held in a converted chapel on the island in September. The BBC gained unprecedented access to the island and the migrant camp there to cover the proceedings.Diego Garcia is part of the Chagos Islands, or British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot), an area described as being ""constitutionally distinct"" from the UK. It is administered from London by a commissioner based out of the Foreign Office.In their time on the island, the Tamils, including 16 children, were housed in military tents in the fenced camp, which was guarded at all times by private security company G4S.Tamils have described their time on the island as like living in ""hell"".""It's like an open prison - we were not allowed to go outside, we were just living in a fence and in a tent,""one woman told the BBCafter being brought to the UK with her husband and two children this month.During a site visit to the camp in September, the court saw rips in some of the tents and rats nesting above military cots that the migrants were given as beds.There were multiple hunger strikes and numerous incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts in response to the conditions in the camp, after which some people were transferred to Rwanda for medical treatment.There were also cases and allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the camp by other migrants, including against children. Margaret Obi, acting judge of the Biot supreme court, said in her ruling on Monday that the camp was a prison ""in all but name"" and ""had been a prison from the outset"".She found that one former deputy commissioner ""appeared to have only a limited appreciation of the fundamental importance of liberty"".Tom Short, a lawyer with firm Leigh Day, said the judgement was ""not only a vindication of our clients' rights but a triumph for the rule of law in the British Overseas Territories.""""Such an affront to fundamental rights should never have happened and in due course this travesty of administration must be looked at in full,"" he added.The camp has now closed but two men with criminal convictions and another under investigation remain on Diego Garcia, the BBC understands.Britain took control of the Chagos Islands from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the base.The judgement comes after theUK agreed earlier this year to hand over the islandsto Mauritius in a historic move.Under the deal, which has still to be signed, Diego Garcia would continue to operate as a UK-US military base but Mauritius would take responsibility for any future migrant arrivals."
"Czech billionaire's takeover of British postal service Royal Mail approvedThe £3.6bn deal by Daniel Kretinsky is cleared after agreeing ""legally binding"" undertakings.7 hrs agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg93390808o,"The sale of Royal Mail's parent company to a Czech billionaire has been cleared by the government.The £3.6bn takeover by Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group has been given the go-ahead after agreeing ""legally binding"" undertakings.The government will retain a so-called ""golden share"" that will require it to approve any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, HQ location and tax residency.EP Group will also have to maintain the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (USO), which currently means it has to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday, and parcels Monday to Friday. The company has committed to maintaining the USO for as long as it owns Royal Mail. Earlier this year, Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he would honour the service - in whatever form it takes -""for as long as I am alive"".The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business ""a fighting chance"".The regulator said in Septemberthat it was looking at these changes, with a decision due next year.Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were ""real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future"".Given letter numbers are falling ""we have to think about what is economical"", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year ""to make sure it is sustainable"". The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year. When debts are included, the deal values the company at £5.3bn.Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said while it was up to shareholders to approve the deal, the agreement the government had reached meant the takeover ""will be a good deal for the UK, be a good deal for the people who work for Royal Mail and a good deal for customers"".Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had ""resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings.He added, that EP Group had a ""mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers"". The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.It has also reached an agreement in principle with unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run.Dave Ward, the general secretary of the CWU union, told the BBC it was an ""extensive agreement"" and the deal was the ""best opportunity"" to save the future of Royal Mail.However, he added that the union had ""not agreed anything"" on USO reform and there was ""a long way to go"" before that happened. IDS also owns a highly profitable European parcels business called GLS which made over £300m last year. This offset lossesat Royal Mail, allowing IDS to report a small profit.By bringing GLS parcel know-how to the UK market, coupled with investment in out-of-home delivery lockers, Mr Kretinsky hopes to build a pan-European logistics business.The hope is that this will enable Royal Mail to claw back market share it has lost in recent years in the profitable and growing parcels business.Mr Kretinsky has a net worth of £6bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury's, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU.Earlier this year the takeover was called in for review under national security laws as Royal Mail is considered vital national infrastructure.But speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a ""legitimate business figure""whose alleged links to Russiahad already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago. Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses.The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels.Last week,Royal Mail was fined £10.5mby the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.Ofcom's Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would ""absolutely"" hold Royal Mail to account.Jenny Hall, director of corporate affairs at Royal Mail, told the BBC the company was investing to improve performance, but it was ""really important"" the USO was reformed to reflect consumer trends.She added that Royal Mail would always try to keep postage costs as low as possible, but prices do ""need to reflect the realities of delivering the service"".The price of a second-class stamp, which is currently 85p, is regulated by Ofcom, with the amount Royal Mail can increase it by each year tied to inflation.However, there are no such limits on first-class stamps, and in October Royal Mailpushed the price for first-class mailup by 30p to £1.65, citing ""very real and urgent"" financial challenges for the move.

"Calls for senior bishop to resign over Church of England sex abuse case failingsStephen Cottrell knew that a priest was banned from being alone with children, but the priest remained in post.4 hrs agoUK",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwydgjevx70o,"The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell is facing calls to resign over his handling of a sexual abuse case, days before he takes temporary charge of the Church of England.As Bishop of Chelmsford, Mr Cottrell let priest David Tudor remain in post in the diocese despite knowing he had been barred by the Church from being alone with children and had paid compensation to a sexual abuse victim, a BBC investigation reveals.Tudor was onlybanned from ministry two months ago- after he admitted historical sex abuse allegations relating to two girls.Since this article was first published, Mr Cottrell has responded saying he is ""deeply sorry"" that action could not be taken earlier, but that was the situation he inherited.However, the Bishop of Newcastle the Rt Rev Helen-Ann Hartley has said Mr Cottrell could have done more and should resign as archbishop. ""It completely undermines his credibility that this case was not acted on,"" she told BBC File on 4 Investigates.""How can you have the moral and ethical authority to lead an institution with that?""A woman who was paid £10,000 compensation by Tudor over claims he sexually abused her as a child says Mr Cottrell's failure to act when he was told about the payment means he should ""leave the Church"".""I feel like he [Stephen Cottrell] has spat in my face,"" says Jessica (not her real name).The calls for Archbishop Cottrell to resign come at a time of turmoil in the Church of England following a damning report into how it covered up prolific abuse by the barrister John Smyth.The report led to theresignation of the Church's most senior figure, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. Mr Cottrell will take over his role temporarily for a few months in the New Year.The BBC can reveal that Mr Welby and a former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, were also involved in the Tudor case - Mr Welby in 2018 and Lord Carey in 1993.David Tudor did not respond to the BBC's questions. At least seven women say they were abused by Tudor. One received six-figure compensation from the Church in 2019.David McClenaghan, a partner at Bolt Burdon Kemp solicitors who brought the claim on behalf of the woman and who has supported other survivors of clerical abuse says ""one of the most surprising aspects of this case was that they suspended him on full pay and over a period of time,  funded his accommodation and lifestyle.""Tudor worked for the Church of England for over 46 years, in London, Surrey and Essex, rising from curate to honorary canon. He gained a reputation for filling churches with his charismatic preaching.He was an area dean on Canvey Island in Essex in 2010, when Stephen Cottrell became Bishop of Chelmsford - a position Mr Cottrell held for 10 years before becoming Archbishop of York.During his first week in office, Mr Cottrell was fully briefed on the ""longstanding safeguarding concerns"" raised about Tudor, a spokesperson for the Archbishop said.Mr Cottrell would have been told: In 1988, David Tudor was a defendant in two criminal trialsIn the first trial, he was acquitted of indecently assaulting a 15-year-old school girl although he admitted having sex with her when she was 16In the second trial, he was convicted of indecently assaulting three girls and was jailed for six months. The conviction was quashed on technical grounds because the judge had misdirected the juryIn 1989, Tudor was banned for sexual misconduct by a Church tribunal but was allowed to return to ministry after 5 yearsIn 2005, Tudor was suspended as police investigated an allegation he had indecently assaulted a child in the 1970s. He was not charged and was allowed back to work under conditionsFrom January 2008, Tudor had been working under a safeguarding agreement preventing him from being alone with children or entering schools in Essex - and yet months later he had become an area dean in charge of 12 parishes Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC that for much of his time as Bishop of Chelmsford he had been unable to take any disciplinary action because there were no complaints that hadn't already been dealt with.It was not until 2019, when a fresh complaint was made against Tudor leading to a suspension, that there was ""an opportunity to remove the risk"", said a spokesperson.Bishop Hartley, told File on 4 Investigates that had not been an adequate response because ""any action that could have been taken"" by Mr Cottrell ""should have been vastly stronger than simply to try and manage a risk, particularly if the priest in question is already banned from working with children or entering schools"".In a statement issued on Monday, Mr Cottrell says in 2019 he had ""acted immediately"" suspending David Tudor from all ministry pending the subsequent tribunalin which he was prohibited from ministry for life. While Mr Cottrell's office maintains there were no legal grounds to act until 2019, the BBC can reveal that Mr Cottrell was told in 2012 about the £10,000 payout Tudor had made to Jessica, who says she was sexually abused by him, sometimes very violently, from the age of 11 during the 1970s when Tudor was training to be a minister.She had brought the claim after police ended an investigation without pressing charges.""Nobody would make a payment if they haven't got something to hide,"" says Jessica.Bishop Hartley says the payout was ""completely against the principles of the institution"" that Mr Cottrell is supposed to be part of and should have led to disciplinary proceedings against the priest. The personal payment made by Tudor ""admitted no liability"" - Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC - adding that the then-Bishop of Chelmsford had been guided by ""legal advice"" that no further action could be taken.To compound the hurt felt by those who say they were abused as children by Tudor, three years after making his compensation payment, Tudor became an honorary canon of Chelmsford Cathedral.Such an appointment was ""just horrendous"" says Jessica. David Tudor's elevation to honorary canon is something Stephen Cottrell ""regrets"", says his office, but it was ""not a promotion and not a personal reward"".""It happened because of a change in Church policy during the bishop's time in office, meaning area deans were automatically made honorary canons.""But that is ""ludicrous"" says Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley and ""simply not good enough"".""You are absolutely uplifting somebody's ministry as an example and a model of good and best practice, and you're celebrating that actually by making them an honorary canon.""In his statement after this article was first published, Mr Cottrell said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that it was being reported ""as if it was an abuser being ignored or even protected"".""Actually, nothing could be further from the truth,"" he said.The Church's deputy lead bishop for safeguarding, the Bishop of Birkenhead Rt Rev Julie Conalty, says she is ""baffled"" as to how David Tudor ended up as a licensed priest in the Diocese of Chelmsford.She toldBBC Radio 4's World at Onethat Stephen Cottrell did ""absolutely the right thing"" by suspending him in 2019 - but she doesn't understand why, in the years before, Tudor become an honorary canon or remained an area dean.""There are questions to answer,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One. ""I'm less clear as to whether those issues are a resigning matter [for Stephen Cottrell] in the context of this case.""The Bishop of Newcastle Rt Rev Hartley has been a lone voice in the upper echelons of the Church of England, criticising the institution's failure to deal with abuse and to listen to victims. Last month, she became the only senior serving clericto call for Justin Welby to step down.Now, she says, Stephen Cottrell should follow.The BBC's investigation into the David Tudor case also reveals roles played by others at the very top of the Church of England over several decades - including former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey.Debbie (not her real name) says between the ages of 13 and 15 she was sexually abused by Tudor when he was a vicar and school chaplain in Redhill, Surrey. She was one of the three girls in his second trial in 1988. Tudor was found guilty, but the conviction was later quashed.It has had ""a huge effect"" on Debbie's life, she says, leaving her with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which she says has been made worse by the Church's handling of the case since.""It's absolutely disgusting that they supported him, that they welcomed him back into the Church,"" she says.Tudor's return to the priesthood was assisted by then-Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey.In 1993, the archbishop - now Lord Carey - agreed that Tudor could come back under supervision the following year.  This was done ""with some trepidation"", the Church of England told the BBC.Leaked documents seen by File on 4 Investigates also show that Lord Carey agreed, in 1996, to remove the priest's name from a centrally-held record of clergy who had been subject to disciplinary proceedings. Lord Carey said he does not remember David Tudor's name. The Church of England said the request was made by the then-Bishop of Southwark Roy Williamson, who died in 2019, and Lord Carey had agreed to it.""We recognise these procedures were neither sufficient nor survivor-focussed, and that very different decisions would have been made today,"" Southwark diocese told the BBC.""The decision not to impose a lifetime ban on David Tudor seems absolutely inexcusable in today's context and would not have been made today.""The Tudor case also came across the desk of the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in 2018, when Rev Jenny Penn wrote to his office questioning why the priest was still in post.She had been a member of a ""core group"" of Church safeguarding advisers, and national and local clergy, asked to look into Tudor because another of his alleged victims involved in the 1988 trials had issued a claim for compensation - this time from the Church, rather than Tudor personally.The woman would later win a six-figure Church payout and an apology.Archbishop Welby had recently told all clergy that it wasn't enough to say sorry about past abuse - and that they should ""take action that demonstrates clearly that we have learnt the lessons"".In her letter to him, Rev Penn said she was ""struggling with the disconnect between the words and the practice"".

"Bitcoin hits new record high of more than $106,000The world's largest cryptocurrency has risen by more than 50% since Donald Trump's election victory.8 hrs agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ywp0l0xrxo,"Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, extending a rally that has seen the cryptocurrency's price rise by more than 50% since Donald Trump's victory in the 5 November election.The world's largest cryptocurrency briefly passed $106,000 (£83,890), before falling back to around $105,000 in Asia trade on Monday.The incoming Trump administration is seen as being far more friendly towards cryptocurrencies than the Biden White House.On Thursday, the US president-elect reiterated that he is considering creating a national stockpile of the digital currency, similar to the country's strategic oil reserve. ""The Bitcoin rally since the election has been parabolic and the FOMO - or fear of missing out - rally is gathering momentum,"" Peter McGuire from trading platform XM.com told the BBC.""Many investors believe $120,000 is achievable by the end of the year and then in 2025 there's talk of greater than $150,000 by mid-year"".Earlier this month, Trump named Silicon Valley entrepreneur David Sacks as his artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency tsar.Mr Sacks is a former PayPal executive and a close friend of Trump adviser and mega-donor Elon Musk. Trump has also said he would nominate pro-cryptocurrency Washington attorney Paul Atkins as the new head of the Wall Street regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Last month,the SEC's current head, Gary Gensler, said he would resign from the roleon the day of Trump's inauguration, on 20 January next year.""I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility. The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favour,"" Mr Gensler wrote on the social media platform X.Trump had previously revealed plans to sack Mr Gensler on ""day one"" of his new administration after the SEC chairman took legal action against cryptocurrency firms, sparking controversy in some quarters."
4OpenAI whistleblower found dead in San Francisco apartment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0el3r2nlko,"An OpenAI researcher-turned-whistleblower has been found dead in an apartment in San Francisco, authorities said.The body of Suchir Balaji, 26, was discovered on 26 November after police said they received a call asking officers to check on his wellbeing.The San Francisco medical examiner's office determined his death to be suicide and police found no evidence of foul play.In recent months Mr Balaji had publicly spoken out against artificial intelligence company OpenAI's practices, which has been fighting a number of lawsuits relating to its data-gathering practices. In October,the New York Times published an interviewwith Mr Balaji in which he alleged that OpenAI had violated US copyright law while developing its popular ChatGPT online chatbot.The article said that after working at the company for four years as a researcher, Mr Balaji had come to the conclusion that ""OpenAI's use of copyrighted data to build ChatGPT violated the law and that technologies like ChatGPT were damaging the internet"".OpenAI says its models are ""trained on publicly available data"".Mr Balaji left the company in August, telling the New York Times he had since been working on personal projects.He grew up in Cupertino, California, before going to study computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.A spokesperson for OpenAI said in a statement cited by CNBC News that it was ""devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones during this difficult time"".US and Canadian news publishers, including the New York Times, and a group of best-selling writers, including John Grisham, have filed lawsuits claiming the company was illegally using news articles to train its software.OpenAI told the BBC in November its software is ""grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation"".If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line, , or contactSamaritans.If you're in the US, call 988, or contactLifeline."
8German Chancellor Olaf Scholz loses  confidence vote,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg36pp6dpyo,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a vote of confidence in parliament, paving the way for early elections on 23 February.Scholz called Monday's vote and had expected to lose it, but calculated that triggering an early election was his best chance of reviving his party's political fortunes.It comes around two months after the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government, which left the embattled chancellor leading a minority administration.Ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said it would now be up to voters to ""determine the political course of our country"", teeing up what is likely to be a fiercely fought election campaign. Losing Monday's no-confidence vote was the outcome Scholz had wanted.Thanks to the loss, elections can now happen in February, rather than in September as originally scheduled.There were 207 MPs, mainly from his own party, who voted for Scholz, while 394 voted against him and 116 abstained.Since Scholz's argumentative three-party governing coalitioncollapsed in November, he had been reliant on support from the opposition conservatives to pass any new laws, effectively rendering his administration a lame-duck government.Given Germany's stalled economy and the global crises facing the West, staggering on until the scheduled election date of September 2025 risked being seen as irresponsible by the electorate.Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SDP) is trailing heavily in opinion polls, while the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Friedrich Merz appears to be on course for a return to government.Opening debate ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said the snap election was an opportunity to set a new course for the country and called for ""massive"" investment, particularly in defence, while Merz said more debt would be a burden for younger generations and promised tax cuts. Scholz's decision to stage a vote he expected to lose in order to dissolve his own government was described as a ""kamikaze"" move by the German tabloid Bild - but it is generally the only way a German government can dissolve parliament and spark early elections.The process was designed specifically by the post-war founders of modern Germany to avoid the political instability of the Weimar era.This vote of confidence is not a political crisis in itself: it is a standard constitutional mechanism that has been used by modern German chancellors five times to overcome political stalemate - and one Gerhard Schröder deployed on two occasions. However, there is a deeper problem within German politics.On the surface, the collapse of the coalition was sparked by a row over money. Scholz's centre-left SDP and his Green partners wanted to ease Germany's strict debt rules to finance support for Ukraine and key infrastructure projects.That was blocked by Scholz's own finance minister, Christian Lindner, who is the leader of the business-friendly liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which prioritised driving down the debt.Lindner was sacked and the coalition collapsed. After years of unedifying bickering, you could almost hear the sigh of relief in Berlin's corridors of power - but the underlying cause is more difficult to resolve and more worrying.Germany's party political system has become more fragmented, with more parties than ever in parliament. The new upstart political forces are also more radical.In 2017, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the Bundestag for the first time, winning 12.6%.In 2021, it slipped to 10.4%, but is now polling at almost 20%. The AfD will not get into government because no-one will work with it to form a coalition. But the far-right is eating into the share of the vote that goes to the two centrist big-tent parties which have always put forward modern German chancellors.The bigger the AfD share is, the more difficult it becomes for mainstream parties to form a stable governing coalition.That was arguably the underlying problem that pulled apart Scholz's fractious coalition: big-spending left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens trying to work with free-market small-state liberals.Rather than going away after the next election in February, that problem is likely to get worse. If the far-right wins a fifth of seats in parliament, it could be even more difficult after February to form a stable coalition between like-minded parties. Another new populist political party could also get into parliament for the first time, the anti-migrant nativist far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance BSW, which is named after its firebrand Marxist leader.The conservatives are leading in the polls, but as things stand their options for coalition partners are limited.They refuse to work with the far-right and it is hard to imagine they would like to work with the radical left either. The free-market liberals may not even get into parliament, and some conservatives refuse to consider the Greens.That leaves Scholz's SDP as a possible partner - even though Scholz is likely to be ousted from power after his stint in power saw his popularity plummet.Whatever the next government looks like, the era of cosy consensual coalitions in Germany seems to be over."
9Ireland's Israel stance 'more extreme than any other country',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0nwd9n9ylo,"Ireland has taken ""a more extreme stance than any other country"" against Israel, the Israeli ambassador to the country has said.Dana Erlich was speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ after her country's decision to close its embassy in Ireland.Erlich said the ""tough decision"" was not taken lightly.Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris said that he did not regret the Irish government's intervention in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) case in relation to Israel. Ireland had previously indicated its support for South Africa's legal action against Israel in the ICJ, saying it would ask the court ""to broaden its interpretation of what constitutes the commission of genocide by a state"".Harris has also rejected that Ireland is anti-Israel.However, speaking on RTÉ News at One, Erlich said of Ireland's request to the ICJ: ""This is an abuse of the international multilateral system by South Africa, we were sorry to see Ireland join it, but this joins an accumulation of steps, rhetoric and initiatives that we've seen Ireland trying to promote this past year.""Unfortunately in the past year we've seen Ireland position itself in an extreme position that no other country has put itself.""In most countries we have difficult conversations and we have disagreements – we accept criticism, but this has gone over that line in Ireland.""We see Ireland in a more extreme stance than any other country.""Erlich said she heard concerns from the Jewish and Israeli communities in Ireland.""We direct those concerns to the Irish government, the government that needs to make sure that they are safe, that there is a future for the Jewish community in Ireland,"" she said.""These assurances need to be made."" The taoiseach said his ""priority is to shine a spotlight on what is happening in the Middle East and we should not allow anything to distract from what is happening"".He said although he regretted the actions of the Israeli government regarding the embassy closure, he emphasised the importance of diplomatic relations and that Ireland would continue to engage with Israel.""I'm very proud of the decision Ireland has taken, we are pro human rights and international law,"" he added.Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said the Irish government must ""hold firm"" on its stance with regard to Israel and Gaza.McDonald described the move by Israel over its embassy in Dublin as an attempt to test the will of the Irish government.""We need to work with others to bring as much pressure as possible on the [Benjamin] Netanyahu regime,"" she said. Ireland's Jewish Representative Council chairperson said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the deterioration in the relationship between the Ireland and Israel.Chairperson Maurice Cohen said that the closure of Israel's embassy has caused distress for Israeli people in Ireland.He said the Irish government's intervention in the ICJ risks ""oversimplifying a highly complex and tragic conflict, unfairly isolating Israel, and undermining the integrity of the term 'genocide'.""Mr Cohen said that for the Jewish community in Ireland, ""the closure of the embassy represents not only a symbolic blow but also a practical disadvantage"".""Consular services provided by the embassy are vital for those maintaining connections with family, culture, and heritage in Israel,"" he added.""Losing this resource will leave many feeling unsupported and aggrieved.""Closing the embassy risks alienating a significant segment of Irish society and sends a message that dialogue is being replaced by disengagement.""He said that the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland reaffirmed its commitment to peace and the protection of innocent lives ""on all sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict"", while also supporting Israel's right to defend itself from ""terrorism and existential threats"".Mr Cohen called on both the Irish and Israeli governments to seek pathways to rebuild trust and to ensure avenues for diplomatic engagement remain open. Daniel Epstein-O'Dowd, from the Ireland Israel Alliance, told BBC News NI that it was a ""predictable"" decision by Israel to close its embassy in Dublin and that ""post October 7th there has just been provocation after provocation by the Irish government"".He said it is a ""very symbolic move by Israel and showing that they ultimately don't see any value in retaining any diplomatic presence"" in the Republic of Ireland.""There are many Israelis who are in the tech industry here in Dublin who are a little bit stranded and isolated quite frankly, they feel the Israeli embassy was very much there for them, particularly in the dark days immediately post October 7th, the embassy really shone through in the sense of that community,"" he added.""So I think it is wondering where do they go next?""I don't think that detail has yet been released, but I think it is ultimately going to be somewhere else other than Ireland, it's a very sad day for anybody in Ireland or Israel."" Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said there are no plans to close its embassy in Israel.On 7 October last year, Hamas launched an attack in southern Israel killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.In retaliation, Israel launched a massive operation inside the Gaza Strip with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas.So far, at least 44,875 people have been killed and more than 100,000 injured - mostly civilians, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The UN regards these figures as reliable."
10Drone detection system deployed to New York after mystery sightings,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvnjp30pplo,"US officials are sending a drone detection system to New York, Governor Kathy Hochul says, after questions over mysterious objects in the skies over the east coast and beyond grew in recent days.Hochul requested the federal assistance after drone sightings forced runways at Stewart International Airport in the state to shut for an hour last week.""In response to my calls for additional resources, our federal partners are sending a drone detection system to New York,"" Hochul wrote on X on Sunday.She said state governments needed more power to deal on their own with the small, uncrewed aircraft that have also been reported in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Massachusetts. And further west, in Ohio, drone sightings also led to the closure of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for about an hour on Friday night, according to local media.""Congress must pass a law that will give us the power to deal directly with the drones,"" Hochul said in her post, after last week promising to ""do whatever it takes to ensure New Yorkers remain safe"".Senator Chuck Schumer said on Sunday he hoped to pass a bill that would give local enforcement more power to investigate unidentified flying objects, saying: ""I'm pushing for answers amid these drone sightings"".He also asked that a drone detection system similar to the one headed for New York also be sent to New Jersey, where most of the aerial encounters have so far been recorded.New Jersey Senator Andy Kim said he went out with local residents over the weekend to observe the night sky, and that he believed - based on conversations with civilian pilots and flight tracking data - that most of the aircraft he saw ""were almost certainly planes"". What we know about mysterious US drone sightingsTwo arrested after 'hazardous drone operation' near Boston airport Despite their demands for more help in dealing with the issue, Hochul and other officials have sought to reassure the public that the suspected drones do not pose a national security threat.On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed the sightings included drones, as well as manned aircraft commonly mistaken for drones. He told ABC News that he knew of ""no foreign involvement"" related to the sightings.The Pentagon has denied the suggestion of one New Jersey representative that the possible drones were coming from an Iranian ""mothership"" lurking off the east coast, while an FBI official has said there may have been ""a slight overreaction"" on the topic.According to Mayorkas, the uptick in drone reports may be due to a change in federal regulations allowing drones to be flown at night.He added that the federal government was working in ""close co-ordination"" with state and local authorities on the issue, saying it was ""critical"" they be given the ability to counter drone activity under federal supervision. With just over a month to go until Donald Trump's inauguration, the president-elect's pick for national security adviser, Republican Representative Mike Waltz, hit out against the Biden administration's response to the sightings.""I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from,"" he told the BBC's US news partner CBS.""We need to get to the bottom of it,"" he said, accusing government agencies of ""pointing at each other"" rather than offering answers.Kim, a Democrat, also called on federal authorities to do more to assuage Americans' concerns.""People have a lot anxiety right now about the economy, health, security etc,"" he wrote on X.""And too often we find that those charged with working on these issues don't engage the public with the respect and depth needed."""

UK Sport invests record £330m for 2028 LA Games,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cjr2lgj0x31o,"Elite sport funding body UK Sport says it will invest a record Â£330m in Britain's Olympic and Paralympic sports for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.More than 50 sports will benefit, though athletics has had its budget reduced for the second cycle running.Five new sports for the 2028 Games - baseball/softball, flag football, lacrosse, Para-climbing and squash - have all received funding.Breaking, which featured for the first time at the Paris Games this summer, is no longer eligible for support after it was axed from the Olympic programme.The total figure will top Â£400m with the addition of athlete performance awards (APAs), which are paid directly to individual athletes and contribute to their living and sporting costs so they can focus on competing - about Â£70m was awarded in APAs in the Paris funding cycle, which totalled Â£385m.Sally Munday, chief executive officer of UK Sport, told BBC Sport funding should not be looked at as either a ""reward"" or a ""punishment"" for performances at the Paris Games.""The decision that we've made against all the sports is we've looked at their potential,"" said Munday.""UK Athletics will receive in excess of Â£30m for the Olympic and Paralympic programmes and we believe that's going to put them in a great place to support their athletes in the lead into LA.""Jack Buckner, CEO of UK Athletics, said the organisation was ""disappointed"" with the decision to reduce the sport's share by Â£1.725m, and highlighted the 10 medals at both the World Championships in 2023 and this year's Olympics ""deserved a higher level of investment"".Canoeing was another sport to have its funding cut, by more than Â£500,000. When the total funding for the Paris 2024 cycle is taken into account, modern pentathlon and equestrian have received a smaller budget, but rowing has increased to Â£24.85m from Â£22.72m, despite a cut between Tokyo and Paris.Meanwhile, British Basketball Federation chair Chris Grant said the sport ""has entered a new era"" with an award of Â£2.925m, primarily to help develop the 3x3 format of the game.Great Britain won 65 medals at this year's Games and 124 medals at the Paralympics.They finished seventh in the Olympic medal table, behind the Netherlands in sixth and fifth-placed France, but Munday said the aim is to be ""consistently top five"".""We'll be really forensic - were there contributing factors that we could do differently to make sure that we don't find ourselves in that position again?"" said Munday.""We will be leaving no stone unturned to make sure that we've really understood what the factors are as to why we came seventh. But we're very clear we want to be consistently top five."""
Stokes blow compounds England slide towards defeat,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cdxzlr1790xo,"Third Test, Hamilton (day three of five)New Zealand 347(Santner 76; Potts 4-90)& 453(Williamson 156, Young 60, Mitchell 60)England 143(Henry 4-48, Santner 3-7, O'Rourke 3-33)& 18-2England need 640 runs to winScorecard England's slide towards a massive defeat in the third Test against New Zealand was compounded by a concerning recurrence of Ben Stokes' hamstring injury.Stokes was in visible distress as he left the field clutching the same left hamstring he injured in August, subsequently missing four Tests.The captain was bowling his third over of the third day, midway through the afternoon session. He pulled up in the follow-through of his second delivery, went straight to the dressing room and did not return for the remainder of the New Zealand second innings. The all-rounder will have a scan overnight.Even before Stokes was injured, England were staring down the barrel as an inevitable Kane Williamson century built New Zealand's monstrous lead.After rain delayed play by two and a half hours, Williamson moved to 156. He added 107 with Rachin Ravindra, who made 44, and another 92 with Daryl Mitchell, who helped himself to 60.When New Zealand were finally bowled out for 453, England's target was a world-record and improbable 658.England were left six overs to bat, in which time Ben Duckett played an awful hack to drag on off the retiring Tim Southee and Zak Crawley was lbw to his tormentor Matt Henry.The tourists will resume on 18-2 when play gets under way at the earlier time of 10:30 (21:30 GMT Monday) on day four.Dry weather is forecast for days four and five, giving New Zealand plenty of time to salvage a consolation victory from a series England have already won.For England, the bigger worry is Stokes' fitness. This is a devastating blow for Stokes, whose progress from left-knee surgery at the end of last year has now been hit by two hamstring injuries in the space of five months.The first, sustained playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred, ruled him out of the home series against Sri Lanka and first Test in Pakistan. Stokes later admitted the mental toll the battle to get fit in Pakistan took on him, made worse by a break-in at his home while he was away.The captain has looked near to his best in New Zealand, the country of his birth, both as a leader and a player.The 33-year-old had been able to play a full role as a fourth seamer, but it is the repeat injury after such a bowling workload that is the cause for alarm.The 23 overs he bowled on the first day of this Test are the most he has bowled in a single day, his 36.2 overs in the match his most since June 2022 and the 66.1 overs in the series his most as captain.Stokes pulled up with a back problem during the first Test in Christchurch, though was able to stay on the field. His immediate reaction here was an instant indication of the severity of the issue.As Ravindra hoiked to mid-on, Stokes hobbled off, covering his face as he left. Ollie Pope, already standing-in as wicketkeeper, took over as captain.Stokes had treatment and will be assessed further before England make a decision on whether he bats in the second innings.His spell with MI Cape Town in the SA T20 in January will surely be cancelled and any slim prospect of a return to the England one-day team for the Champions Trophy is over. More important are the questions over his long-term prospects as a Test bowler. When New Zealand resumed on 136-3, leading by 340, England's prospects were already bleak and Williamson mercilessly removed any semblance of hope.On his home ground, Williamson racked up his seventh century and nudged his average at Seddon Park to 94.94. From 50 overnight, he was watchful and correct, mainly waiting for England to drop short in order to cut to the square boundary.On 73, Williamson survived the tightest lbw shout from Brydon Carse and on 80 miscued Shoaib Bashir over Carse at mid-wicket. On 86, a pull at a Stokes bouncer was parried by Pope flying down the leg side. It would have been a magnificent catch.When Stokes was injured he was replaced in the attack by left-arm spinner Jacob Bethell, whom Williamson hit for six over long-on to go to his 33rd Test hundred. The action simply became about how many runs New Zealand wanted to amass.Williamson seemed nailed for a double, only to sweep Bashir to sub fielder Rehan Ahmed at deep square leg. Mitchell holed out to long-off to become Bethell's first Test wicket.The futility of New Zealand continuing to grow their lead bordered on farce. England spared their seamers and Harry Brook bowled with the second new ball.The crowd chanted for Southee and got their wish after Mitchell Santner was out for 49, including five sixes. England gave Southee his second guard of honour of the match, his quest to add to his 98 career sixes ended by lofting Bethell to long-on. Next ball, Bethell bowled Henry to end with 3-72.Zak Crawley overturned being given out leg before to Henry from the fifth ball of the innings, before Duckett's ridiculous charge at Southee.There was still time for Henry to get Crawley for the sixth time in six innings in the series. Crawley ends with a series average of 8.66 â no England opener has ever batted as much in a single series and ended with a lower average."

US players to be paid £400k for playing in Ryder Cup,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/clyg859jed5o,"Players on next year's United States Ryder Cup team will be paid to compete after a package was agreed by the PGA of America.It will be the first time in the 98-year history of the matches that either side has been paid to play.The 12 players will each receive $500,000 (Â£400,000), with $300,000 (Â£240,000) donated to a charity or charities chosen by each member of the team.The PGA of America, which organises the event, approved the package despite saying ""no players asked to be compensated"".Six players will qualify automatically via the US Ryder Cup points list and captain Keegan Bradley will make six wildcard selections.""The players and captains, past and present, are responsible for the Ryder Cup becoming the most special competition in golf and one of the most in-demand events on the international sports scene,"" the PGA of America said in a statement.Last year's contest in Rome was marked by Patrick Cantlay not wearing the American team cap in what wasreported to be a protest,externalat the fact the players were not being remunerated to compete.Europe's Rory McIlroy said last month he would pay to play in the matches, which will be held at Bethpage in New York.""I personally would pay for the privilege to play on the Ryder Cup,""McIlroy told BBC Sport.""The two purest forms of competition in our game right now are the Ryder Cup and the Olympics, and it's partly because of that, the purity of no money being involved."" Europe won the 2023 Ryder Cupin Rome, where Cantlay's cap stance led to home fans removing their headwear as he approached in an attempt to taunt the American.It ultimately led to a spat between McIlroy and Cantlay's caddie Joe LaCava, who waved his cap close to the Northern Irishman as he lined up a putt after his player had holed a long effort on the 18th in a match against the four-time major champion and Matt Fitzpatrick.That episode spilled into angry scenes in the car park at Marco Simone afterwards, which McIlroy and captain Luke Donald said fired up Europe for Sunday's singles.""I don't think any of the 24 players on either team needs 400 grand,"" McIlroy said.""Every two years, there are 104 weeks and 103 weeks you can play golf and get paid.""Europe, who have not won on American soil since 2012, will again be captained in 2025 by Donald."

Not counting this season, there have been 91 times when a team have parted company with their manager while in the drop zone - and on 36 of those occasions they avoided relegation.That is a success rate of 40%, so we know the difficult decision can work.Of those 36 cases, five of the teams were exactly five points adrift when the manager left, like Wolves.Sam Allardyce kept up two of those five teams - Blackburn in 2008-09 and Sunderland in 2015-16.Tony Parkes, as a caretaker, saved Blackburn from such a perilous position in 1996-97, while Harry Redknapp saw Tottenham to safety in 2008-09.Tony Pulis helped Crystal Palace avoid the drop in 2013-14, although by the time he took over from caretaker Keith Millen they were only three points off safety.Only one of those five instances happened this late in a season, though - when Blackburn sacked Paul Ince on 16 December 2008 and hired Allardyce two days later.The other four changes with teams five points adrift all happened in October.One good omen for Wolves is that they were the second most recent team who changed managers while in the bottom three and stayed up.That was when Julen Lopetegui replaced Bruno Lage - via Steve Davis' caretaker spell - just before the 2022 World Cup. Um...No team have ever had a change of manager when nine points adrift (or anything more than five points) and stayed up.In fact, only two teams have ever stayed up after being nine points or more from safety at any stage of the season.They are Blackburn in 1996-97 - a week or so after Parkes replaced Ray Harford - and West Ham in 2006-07.The Hammers, who replaced Alan Pardew with Alan Curbishley earlier that season, were 10 points adrift with nine games to go - but they won seven of those to stay up.Changing manager while in the drop zone has worked for Southampton three times - when Ian Branfoot left in 1993-94, Stuart Gray left in 2001-02 and Mark Hughes exited in 2018-19.But the tactic failed for them twice in 2022-23 when first Ralph Hasenhuttl in November and then Nathan Jones in February left.But in none of those instances were they in this big of a mess.We also now know Southampton will be bottom of the table at Christmas - with only four previous teams having survived from that position in Premier League history.West Bromwich Albion (2004-05), Sunderland (2013-14), Leicester (2014-15) and Wolves (2022-23) are the four sides to manage it. Looking more recently - in the five seasons previous to this campaign, 16 teams parted company with their manager while in the relegation zone. Only five of them stayed up.Last season the same three teams spent most of the season in the bottom three - Burnley, Luton and Sheffield United.The Blades changed manager but the other two did not - and they all went down."
