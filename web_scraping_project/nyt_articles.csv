Powell’s Fed Appears Headed for Another Collision With Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/business/economy/trump-powell-fed.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Rates may not come down as much or as quickly as had been expected, just as Trump — a self-declared “low-rate guy” — returns to the White House. ByJeanna Smialek Jeanna Smialek has covered the Fed for more than a decade, including throughout the first Trump presidency. Inside the halls of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters overlooking Constitution Avenue in Washington D.C., casual mentions of the incoming Trump administration are cautious and infrequent. That’s by design. Donald J. Trump had a fraught relationship with the politically independent Fed during his first term. The president wanted central bankers to lower interest rates more aggressively and faster than they thought was economically appropriate. When officials refused to comply, he blasted them as “boneheads” and an “enemy.” He flirted with tryingto fireJerome H. Powell, the Fed chair. He tried (and failed) to appoint loyalists to central bank leadership roles. As the Fed enters a new Trump era with interest rates higher than they were at any point in his first term, tensions seem poised to escalate once again — and America’s central bank is on high alert. Fed analysts try to avoid casually discussing tariffs in email or Microsoft Teams meetings, wary that the information could become public and make the Fed look anti-Trump, according to one staff economist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. Hallway chatter has taken a negative tone but is often studiously generic and apolitical, according to people familiar with the mood inside the building who also requested anonymity. And while Fed officials and economists have had to begin to consider what Mr. Trump’s promised policies might do to growth and inflation, they have avoided publicly speculating. Central bankers are, in effect, keeping their heads down to stay out of the limelight. But try as they might, they appear destined for another crash course with Mr. Trump. The president-electpromised“interest rates cuts the likes of which you have never seen before” while campaigning. Fed officials have been cutting rates since September and are on course to lower them further as inflation cools, but they are unlikely to reduce them as much as Mr. Trump is hoping.

A Ride-Hailing Start-Up in Washington Tries to ‘Out-Uber Uber’,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/technology/empower-ride-hailing-washington-dc.html,"A company called Empower is trying to take on Uber, Lyft and local regulators as it piles up fines and draws new passengers to its service. Drivers for the ride-hailing company Empower protest outside a City Council meeting in Washington, D.C.Credit...Tierney L. Cross for The New York Times Supported by ByEli Tan Eli Tan spoke to Empower drivers in Washington and visited the company’s office in McLean, Va., to report this article. On a recent Tuesday morning outside Union Station’s train hall in Washington, a stream of taxicabs, Ubers and Lyfts pulled to the curb to pick up passengers. In the mix, too, was another type of vehicle. “Right there,” said Jonathan Rogers, the head of the city’s Department of For-Hire Vehicles, pointing to an unmarked sedan dropping off a passenger. “That’s an Empower.” Founded in 2019, the ride-hailing start-upEmpowerhas become a serious rival to Uber and Lyft in Washington. It now does 100,000 rides in the city each week, good for 10 percent of the local market, a larger share than the city’s taxis. But the company has refused to register with Mr. Rogers’s agency, meaning that it operates in the city illegally. While drivers and riders have taken to Empower because of its cheap prices, its rapid growth has been met with mounting legal troubles, and now, Mr. Rogers and Brianne Nadeau, a member of the District of Columbia Council who leads the Committee on Public Works and Operations, are making a push to shut it down. The start-up has racked up over $100 million in unpaid fines. It is beinginvestigatedby the Council and has beensuedby the District of Columbia attorney general’s office. Last month, a Superior Court judge ordered the company to cease operations. To some regulators, Empower’s tactics are more than just familiar — they’re a page out of Uber’s playbook from when it arrived in Washington a decade ago and wrested control of the transit market from taxi companies.

"Amazon Disregarded Internal Warnings on Injuries, Senate Investigation Claims",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/business/economy/amazon-warehouse-injuries.html,"Advertisement Supported by A staff report by the Senate labor committee, led by Bernie Sanders, uncovered evidence of internal concern about high injury rates at the e-commerce giant. ByNoam Scheiber Noam Scheiber has covered working conditions at Amazon for more than five years. For years, worker advocates and some government officials have argued that Amazon’s strict production quotas lead to high rates of injury for its warehouse employees. And for years, Amazon has rejected the criticism, arguing that it doesn’t use strict quotas, and that its injury rates are falling close to or below the industry average. On Sunday, the majority staff of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which is chaired by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, publishedan investigationthat found that Amazon itself had documented the link between its quotas and elevated injury rates. Internal company documents collected by Mr. Sanders’s investigators show that Amazon health and safety personnel recommended relaxing enforcement of the production quotas to lower injury rates, but that senior executives rejected the recommendations apparently because they worried about the effect on the company’s performance. The report also affirmed the findings of investigations undertaken by aunion-backed groupshowing that injury rates at Amazon were almost twice the average for the rest of the industry. “The shockingly dangerous working conditions at Amazon’s warehouses revealed in this 160-page report are beyond unacceptable,” Mr. Sanders said in a statement. “Amazon’s executives repeatedly chose to put profits ahead of the health and safety of its workers by ignoring recommendations that would substantially reduce injuries.” Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokeswoman, said the internal studies and recommendations Mr. Sanders’s report cited were later found by the company to be invalid. “Sen. Sanders’ report is wrong on the facts and weaves together out-of-date documents and unverifiable anecdotes to create a preconceived narrative,” she said.

Automakers Thrived in the Pandemic. Many Are Now Struggling.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/business/automakers-trouble.html,"Advertisement Supported by Changing technology, political turmoil and competition from China are cutting into profits and forcing carmakers to cut jobs and close factories. ByJack Ewing Jack Ewing has covered the auto industry for more than 20 years. A few years ago, automakers were celebrating record profits as the pandemic created shortages of new cars, allowing them to raise prices. Now the hangover is setting in. Nissan, the Japanese automaker, is laying off 9,000 employees.Volkswagenis considering closing factories in Germany for the first time. The chief executive of the U.S. and European automaker Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, quit after sales tumbled. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are struggling. Each carmaker has its own problems, but there are some common threads. They include a tricky and expensive technological transition, political turmoil, rising protectionism and the emergence of a new class of fast-growing Chinese carmakers. The many woes raise questions about the future of companies that are a critical source of jobs in many Western and Asian countries. Many of these problems have been apparent for years but became less pressing during the pandemic, lulling some automakers into complacency. When shortages of semiconductors and other components slowed production and limited inventory, carmakers found it easy to raise prices. But that era is over and the industry has reverted to its prepandemic state, with too many carmakers chasing too few buyers. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Fights like these reflect a troubling national trend: Cellphones are stoking — and making it harder to stop — violence in schools from Massachusetts to California. Supported by Ricardo Martinez, an 11th grader, was in his high school lunchroom in April when a mass brawl erupted. He watched, horrified, as a dozen teenage boys rampaged through the cafeteria, pummeling and kicking one another, overturning tables and chairs. Other students jeered and jostled to film the fight on their phones. “It was like a stampede of videos,” said Mr. Martinez, now 18 and a senior. “Everyone was trying to get the best angle.” But the pandemonium at Revere High School in Revere, Mass., was just beginning. Within minutes, students in other parts of the building began receiving text messages about the lunchroom brawl. Suddenly, teachers said, dozens of riled-up teenagers started racing down hallways and careening down stairways with their phones to get to the fight. To stop more people from flooding into the cafeteria, Revere High posted staff members in front of the lunchroom entrances and issued a “hold” order to keep students in their classrooms. Administrators called the police to help restore calm. The school said it ultimately suspended 17 students involved in the brawl. Across the United States, technology centered on cellphones — in the form of text messages, videos and social media — has increasingly fueled and sometimes intensified campus brawls, disrupting schools and derailing learning. The school fight videos then often spark new cycles of student cyberbullying, verbal aggression and violence. Hello! I've spent the last few months reporting on tech-fueled violence in schools for this story. I'm really interested in learning about how your local schools are handling these issues. What are you seeing? What remedies do you think schools should try? @Natasha Singer my daughter’s school in Norfolk VA just installed fight detection technology in all the bathrooms so that officers can respond more quickly. @Natasha Singer TX parent of a middle schooler here. The school had always had a ""soft"" ban on cellphone use during class. However, last year, as in your reporting, a slew of fights broke out and it was getting worse. There was even some local news coverage of our school interviewing parents about the violence. The school responded by enforcement of the cellphone ban. Things are better, not perfect. And no amount of enforcement short of confiscating phones at the entrance will really stop students from using them.So although the violence seems to have gotten a little better, cyber bullying and the online rumor mill continues. @Natasha SingerCurrent teacher in Florida here. This school year, our school board banned cellphones, headphones, AirPods etc., not only during class time but in between classes and during lunch. They provided no extra personnel to help take the phones away, so the ban was not enforced. There is no difference from before the cell phone ban to after the cell phone ban. Students walk around freely with their phones in hand and headphones on AirPods in. Some parents fought it saying their child’s 504 plans allowed them to have a phone.There was an incident of a kid masturbating to porn on his phone in the boys bathroom and another student came in and filmed him masturbating with his phone and then posted it on social media. Kids commit suicide over such things.I sent an email to the superintendent and all school board members about this. I got no response.I have my students put their phones away in a sleeve, which I have been doing for several years. But I am in fighting an uphill, unsupported battle. The kids openly fight me to keep their phones, refuse put them away, or put away fake ones.At least here in southern Florida, we are teaching kids that a governmental body can pass a law, but it doesn’t mean anything. And they will go out into the general public as adult and think the same thing. @Natasha Singer. As a conflict resolution professional, I have worked in numerous schools for the last 30 years. Like the teacher in the article, I have tried to barricade and disperse students & told them to put phones away to not exacerbate the problem.Days before the pandemic lockdown, the organization I worked for, Creative Response to Conflict, completed our “Social Media-tors!” Training with middle schoolers in Queens. This program trains peer mediators to safely intervene in online conflicts.Interestingly, our research showed that when students did not see each other in person, bullying decreased. Students became more selective as to who they engaged with online, knowing there would be no in person ramifications the next day. Bullying is fueled by the ping pong of in person and online. During the pandemic, we removed the in person element. Now schools are struggling to remove phones, which may limit some of the planning and filming of fights during the school day, but it doesn’t impact everything that happens the minute students get their phones back.Part of the solution involves teaching students how & why to become allies instead of bystanders or instigators. Restorative Practices programs also help change the school climate so people get to know each other. This reduces “othering” & makes schools safer & more welcoming, reducing skyrocketing absenteeism.

"Moody’s Downgrades France’s Credit Rating, Citing Political Turmoil",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/business/france-moodys-credit-rating-downgrade.html,"France’sPolitical Turmoil Advertisement Supported by The action, which will put pressure on the nation’s borrowing costs, reflects doubt that a new government can mend the deteriorating financial situation. ByLiz Alderman Reporting from Paris In a surprise announcement, Moody’s rating agency downgraded France’s debt rating early Saturday, hours afterPresident Emmanuel Macron appointed a new prime ministerin a bid to stabilize a government that has been rocked by months of political turmoil. Moody’s decision — which cut France’s sovereign debt assessment to an Aa3 rating, three levels below the highest rating — will put pressure on the nation’s borrowing costs. It reflects doubt that a new government can mend a deteriorating fiscal situation that has made France one of the most financially troubled countries in Europe. Mr. Macron tapped François Bayrou, a veteran centrist politician, on Friday as his fourth prime minister this year. Mr. Bayrou’s predecessor, Michel Barnier,was ousteddays earlier by far-right and left-wing lawmakers over his plans to rein in France’s finances with a belt-tightening budget that included 60 billion euros’ worth ($63 billion) of spending cuts and tax increases. The government collapse hasheaped new burdens on France’s weak economyand left the country without a functioning budget. Mr. Bayrou now has the urgent task of having to finalize a stopgap measure to avoid a potential government shutdown before the new year. Beyond that, he must also draft a new budget bill for 2025 and try to succeed where Mr. Barnier failed — by pushing it through a deeply divided Parliament at a time when investors have grown more worried about France’s creditworthiness. The Standard & Poor’s andFitch Ratings agencieshave also downgraded France’s debt. Few expect Mr. Bayrou, one of Mr. Macron’s top allies, to stabilize France’s roiling politics.Moody’s saidit saw a “very low probability that the next government will sustainably reduce the size of fiscal deficits beyond next year.” The situation raises the risk of what the ratings agency described as “a negative feedback loop between higher deficits, a higher debt load and higher financing costs.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump and His Picks Threaten More Lawsuits Over Critical Coverage,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/business/media/trump-defamation-lawsuit-abc-hegseth-cnn.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement The small flurry of threatened defamation suits is the latest sign that the incoming Trump administration appears poised to do what it can to crack down on unfavorable media coverage. ByDavid Enrich David Enrich’s latest book, to be published in 2025, is about the weaponization of libel law and the campaign to limit press freedoms. The legal threats have arrived in various forms. One aired on CNN. Another came over the phone. More arrived in letters or emails. All of them appeared aimed at intimidating news outlets and others who have criticized or questioned President-elect Donald J. Trump and his nominees to run the Pentagon and F.B.I. The small flurry of threatened defamation lawsuits is the latest sign that the incoming Trump administration appears poised to do what it can to crack down on unfavorable media coverage. Before and after the election, Mr. Trump and his allies have discussed subpoenaing news organizations, prosecuting journalists and their sources, revoking networks’ broadcast licenses and eliminating funding for public radio and television. Actual or threatened libel lawsuits are another weapon at their disposal — and they are being deployed even before Mr. Trump moves back into the White House. It is notoriously difficult for public figures like Mr. Trump to win defamation lawsuits. Under longstanding Supreme Court precedent — which Mr. Trump and some of his allieswant to seeweakened or overturned — plaintiffs must prove that a publisher knew a defamatory statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its accuracy. But that high bar has not stopped a wide range of politicians, business leaders and others from threatening or filing such suits — a strategy that often seems tailored to cause news outlets and individuals to rein in aggressive coverage of the public figures.

One Ski Resort’s Long-Shot Bet to Survive Low Snowfall and Devastating Wildfires,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/business/ski-resorts-low-snowfall-wildfires.html,"Advertisement Supported by square feet The closest ski hill to Los Angeles recently sold to an investment group with big plans. But can those ideas work amid catastrophic climate threats that continue to plague the mountain? ByJosh Stephens For much of its 85-year existence, the Mount Waterman resort has drawn skiers and outdoor enthusiasts from around Los Angeles for its no-fuss, no-frills experience. Unlike all other ski hills in Southern California, Mount Waterman, the closest mountain resort to Los Angeles, didn’t make snow (its motto has long been “Praying for snow since 1939”), and it has only a modest warming hut and three chairlifts. But its steep inclines and access to backcountry terrain kept loyal snow-sports fans coming back. “It’s steep, gladed — one of the greatest places I’ve skied,” said Michael Melton, a board member of the Buckhorn Ski Lodge, a private lodge near Mount Waterman. “It doesn’t have the acreage of a Palisades Tahoe, but it has the punch.” That rustic experience will soon get a face-lift — the ski hill is under contract to be sold to an investment group,Angeles Mountain Partners, with a more aggressive business vision. The new owners, Josh Shelton, an entertainment lawyer, and Scott Towsley, a veteran of ski-area construction in Southern California, have plans for an amphitheater and glamping cabins. They also plan to add a snow-making system and offer a club-membership program that would give skiers helicopter access to Mount Waterman. But for all of their big ideas, the ski hill has for years been hit hard with existential climate threats. From 2011 through 2017, the most severe drought years in recorded California history, Mount Waterman opened for only a few dozen days as it battled higher temperatures, less snowfall and destructive wildfires.

"I Traded My News Apps for Rumble, the Right-Wing YouTube. Here’s What I Saw.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/13/business/rumble-trump-bongino-kirk.html,"ByStuart A. Thompson Stuart Thompson has monitored right-wing media since 2020. He watched 47 hours of video on Rumble for this article. As soon as President-elect Donald J. Trump won the presidential race, influencers on Rumble, the right-wing alternative to YouTube, flooded the platform with a simple catchphrase: “We are the media now.” The idea seemed to capture a growing sense that traditional journalists have lost their position at the center of the media ecosystem. Polls show that trust inmainstream news media has plummeted, and thatnearly half of all young peopleget their news from “influencers” rather than journalists. In its place, they argue, are right-wing digital creators who have found hordes of fans online. Rumble, for instance, is tiny compared with YouTube, but it is a primary source of news for millions of Americans, according toPew Research Center. On election night, its active viewership topped out at more than two million, and the company said in a statement that it averaged more than 67 million monthly active users in the final quarter of 2024. If Rumble was the media now, I wondered what it would be like to consume an all-Rumble diet. So on Nov. 18, about two weeks after the election, I deleted my news apps, unsubscribed from all my podcasts and filtered all my newsletters to the trash. And for the next week, from early morning till late at night, I got all my news from Rumble. I started by visiting Rumble’s homepage on Monday morning where I saw my first recommended video. It was about the risk of nuclear war, with an A.I.-generated photo of President Biden laughing maniacally above a headline that read:“WWIII INCOMING?!Biden Authorizes Strike on Russia Ahead of Trump Taking Office!!” Rumble was once an obscure video platform featuring mostly viral cat videos. Founded in 2013 by a Canadian entrepreneur, it was designed as a home for independent creators who felt crowded out on YouTube. But the platform took a hard right turn around the time of the Capitol riots on Jan. 6, 2021, when social networks and YouTube cracked down on users who violated their rules. Conservatives flocked to other platforms, including Rumble, which quickly embraced its new role as a “free speech” haven — and saw its valuation surge to half a billion dollars practically overnight. Its content today goes far beyond cat videos. Video game livestreams populate its homepage alongside abizarre face-slapping competitioncalled“Power Slap.”But political commentary and news remain its most popular categories by far. A screenshot from the first day of this experiment shows videos about WWIII and live categories focused on news, entertainment and “conspiracies.” I chose a selection of popular “news” shows to watch, along with political content from other areas, like its active “conspiracies” section. Because my experiment began so soon after Mr. Trump swept to victory on Nov. 5, I expected many of the videos to feel triumphant. There were a few moments of joy: After the hosts of “Morning Joe,” the MSNBC talk show,visited Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, hosts of Rumble shows gleefully mocked them, saying they went to“kiss the ring and bend the knee.”Clips of N.F.L. athletes doing Mr. Trump’s dance moves were a sign, the hosts said, that Mr. Trump hadrecaptured popular culturefrom the clutches of Hollywood liberals. But their happiness quickly gave way to a relentless outpouring of anger and frustration, as they fixated on a cast of perceived enemies to blame for America’s troubles — from Democratic politicians toTikTok personalitiesto Republican adversaries. Just a few hours into the experiment, it was clear that I was falling into an alternate reality fueled almost entirely by outrage. Among the claims I heard: Some people at think tanks in Washington were “morons” and“crazier than any schizophrenic.” The Department of Homeland Securitywas runninga “sex-trafficking operation,” a claim apparently based on a misreading of agovernment report. (The report, by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General, indicated that more than 300,000 unaccompanied minors had not received a notice to appear in court or had received the notice but had failed to appear. Some conservative commentators said this meant the children were being trafficked, but experts in immigration policy said it meant no such thing.) Progressives weretrying to get Republicans killed— a claim based on death threats that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she received. After only one day, I could feel my perspective shifting. When I described to my wife what I was hearing on Rumble, she said I was right to feel uneasy because the world I was immersing myself in sounded genuinely awful. Hour by hour, Rumble’s hosts stoked fears about nearly everything: culture wars, transgender Americans and even a potential World War III. On the second night, while catching up on the show “Redacted,” I heard that World War III wasmore or less imminentbecause of rising tensions with Russia but that most Americans were unaware of it. Exactly what to make of this remained unclear to me, but I suspected tensions would need to rise much further before bombs started dropping.Clayton Morris, a former Fox News personality who co-hosts the show with his wife, seemed convinced that nuclear war was coming, describing the lack of fallout shelters in major cities throughout the United States. (I later readnews articlesthat offered afuller picture, suggesting that the risk of escalation was real but that nuclear threats were also a strategy in Mr. Putin’ssaber rattling.) The coverage struck me as particularly scary, but I also paused to consider whether Mr. Morris had any credentials as a Russia-Ukraine analyst. Since 2017, he has pivoted his career from hosting television shows to offering investors “financial freedom” through real estate investing. He was sued in 2019 by two dozen clients who said they weresold ramshackle homesas investment properties, then relocated his family to Portugal before the lawsuits were settled — whichsome saidcomplicated the litigation proceedings. (Mr. Morris denied any wrongdoing.) On Rumble, though, he seemed authoritative: His slickly produced show had more than 560,000 followers and it aired daily with an active comments section filled with supporters. The videos were recommended to me by Rumble’s algorithm, so I kept watching. Other shows referenced clips directly from Russian state television orthe Russian government. During “The Roseanne Barr Show,” a segment about nuclear warbled into an adfor an emergency health kit. (In an email, the show’s co-host Jake Pentland, who is Ms. Barr’s son, told me their show wants to keep Americans “safe and protected from this wildly corrupt administration whether that’s through education or highlighting specific products that can protect them.”) The prospect of an impending World War III stuck with me long after the livestreams ended. As I shuttled my son to day care or walked down aisles at the grocery store, I found my mind drifting to thoughts of nuclear bombs, a military draft or how a global conflict might actually unfold. While watching a segment on the dire prediction, I glanced over at my wife, who was enjoying Netflix’s romantic comedy series “Nobody Wants This,” unaware about the threat of nuclear winter. As the days ticked by, I saw how the outrage stoked online could burst into the real world. Early in the week, multiple hosts on Rumblewere furious overa Democratic official in Pennsylvania who they suggested was trying to steal the election by counting invalid ballots. The controversy gained nationwide attention and the official, Diane Ellis Marseglia, the commissioner for Bucks County, Pa., received profanity-laden emails and death threats. Reading news articles about it later, though, it was clear the situationwas morecomplicatedthan the hosts had suggested. The courts responded withadditional guidanceand the county followed the law. The official eventually apologized for using a badly worded statement that stoked the backlash — and her apology video also made the rounds on Rumble. “We are all going to learn lessons from this new media landscape,” Ms. Marseglia said in her apology. “Most of all, I am.” Dan Bongino, the host of “The Dan Bongino Show,” relished the moment. “Who’s in charge now? We are,” he said triumphantly. “Who made this a story? Us.” It seemed clear that actual news — the objective details about complex situations like election proceedings or the war in Ukraine — mattered far less than how these situations could be contorted to support Mr. Trump or deride Democrats. Nearly every show created a visceral feeling that the nation was barrelling from crisis to crisis. Progressives were getting away with galling levels of incompetence or corruption, the hosts said over and over again. Even though Mr. Trump and the Republican Party would soon control the White House and Congress, and conservatives have a majority on the Supreme Court, there weremore battles to come. After just a week, this alternate reality started shifting how I instinctively reacted to the world outside Rumble. I would catch a stray story on the local news radio about something innocuous, like train delays or traffic jams, and wonder: “Can I really trust this?” It’s true that listening to any single news source long enough will shift your perspective. But few sources have as many ties to Mr. Trump and his incoming administration as Rumble. Its top personalities are frequently seen with Mr. Trump at events or at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home, with hosts suggesting they will have special access to the administration. Vivek Ramaswamy, Mr. Trump’s pick for a new government efficiency initiative, and Howard Lutnick, the likely commerce secretary, owned millions of dollars worth of Rumble shares when it went public in 2022. So did Craft Ventures, which was co-founded by David Sacks, an investor who sits on Rumble’s board of directors and was recentlynamed Mr. Trump’s pick for cryptocurrency czar. Christopher Pavlovski, Rumble’s founder and chief executive, has emerged as a Trump ally, too. In a post on X, he shared a photo from after the election of him standing next to several people, including Elon Musk, one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent backers. At the back of the frame and grinning was the soon to be 47th president of the United States. “Free speech saved,” Mr. Pavlovski wrote. I received a statement from Tim Murtaugh, a representative for Rumble who was also Mr. Trump’s communications director for his 2020 campaign. He said: “The New York Times and its fellow legacy media outlets have lost their monopoly on deciding what information people can have, so of course they’re rushing to attack Rumble, a key alternative in the news marketplace.” The fear and outrage that infused every show was offset by a sense of hopefulness that the president-elect would fix everything — even that the “planet might have been saved” because he was re-elected. Blame for any hiccups in Mr. Trump’s strategy was assigned to Democrats or even Republicans who were not sufficiently obedient. Senator Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican,said on one showthat while Republicans controlled the Senate, the party remained “a third MAGA, a third Republican and a third RINO,” meaning “Republican in name only.” “We’ve got control, but do we have control?” Mr. Tuberville summarized. Perhaps the biggest cheerleader for Mr. Trump was Mr. Bongino, the eponymous host of Rumble’s most-watched show, with 3.4 million followers. Mr. Bongino is a former Fox News host who ranthree unsuccessful bids for elected officebefore striking gold in the right-wing commentary business. The podcast version of his show consistently ranks amongthe top news podcastsin the country. Rumble’s financial documents show that his company, Bongino Inc., owned 5.8 percent of the company when it went public in 2022, now worth more than $100 million. Though I listened to an hour of Mr. Bongino’s opinions each day, it seemed like I learned mostly what various progressive or mainstream media figures had said about different culture war topics, and Mr. Bongino’s predictable reactions to them. Many segments on Mr. Bongino’s show included comments from liberals or mainstream news media, along with Mr. Bongino’s predictable reactions to them. Segments where Bongino reacts to comments by liberals or mainstream media Other segments Each segment Minutes 10 20 30 40 50 60 Nov. 18 Nov. 19 Nov. 20 Nov. 21 Nov. 22 Segments where Bongino reacts to comments by liberals or mainstream media Other segments Each segment 10 minutes 30 50 Nov. 18 19 20 21 22 Note: Times are approximate On his Thursday show, he talked about the nation’s intelligence apparatus — but it was in response to whata CNN host had saidabout its effectiveness. He talked about cancel culture — but in response toa comment on “The View”about Matt Gaetz, Mr. Trump’s first pick for attorney general. He talked about identity politics — but in reaction towhat a Democratic congresswomansaid about race. He talked about the murder conviction of an undocumented migrant — butin reaction to what a news anchorhad said about the case on ABC News. Nearly every show I watched on Rumble framed issues this way, focusing on how news was discussed by mainstream media, and then complaining about it. I don’t remember seeing Mr. Bongino criticize Mr. Trump — not once. He spent the first part of the week saying that Mr. Gaetz, the former Republican congressman who was briefly a contender for attorney general, would surely be confirmed. He seemed to dismissa federal sex-trafficking investigation into Mr. Gaetzby saying it was impossible to find “good” people for top roles. (Mr. Gaetz denied any wrongdoing and the Justice Department declined to file charges.) When Mr. Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration later that week after significant pushback, Mr. Bongino never faulted Mr. Trump for the whole ordeal. Instead, he blamed Republicans and said it was part of Mr. Trump’s strategy to intentionally overwhelm his critics with controversial picks. After watching Rumble nonstop for days, I realized this very article was likely to fuel its own cycle of outrage on the platform. But I was surprised when that happened before it was even published. I wrote to everyone mentioned in the article to ask for their perspective about Rumble and its popular shows, but few replied. Instead, people like Russell Brand, the former actor turned political commentator, took one of my emails and made an entire segment out of it. Mr. Bongino called me“public enemy No. 1”and claimed my story would focus on Rumble’s fringiest voices in a bid to get the site banned. “Don’t ever email us,” he warned. “Don’t. Because you’re going to become part of the show.” Mr. Pentland, the co-host of “The Roseanne Barr Podcast,” posted the email I sent him to his X account. Rumble’s chief executive reposted it, then Elon Musk reposted that to his more than 200 million followers. My phone number was visible, and apparently seen more than 50 million times on the platform, so I was soon flooded with angry phone calls and texts calling my article (which hadn’t yet been published) a “hit job” focused on World War III. On his show, Mr. Pentland referenced my email and said his original ad for a nuclear fallout health kit was meant to “educate our audience” about alternative medicines. Then that segment bled intoanother adfor the health kit. Stephen K. Bannon, host of “War Room,” relayed a message through his producer, saying that his show “exists as the information arm for the activist cadre at the tip of the spear of the MAGA movement.” Candace Owens, the host of the “Candace Show,” was the only one who called me back. She said she was focusing less on political outrage lately after growing weary of chasing negativity. “I realized I was waking up every day and I was looking for things to be angry at,” she said. “And that wasn’t healthy for me.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biden Prepares to Target Chinese Legacy Chips With Trade Investigation,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/business/economy/biden-china-chips-investigation.html,"Advertisement Supported by The investigation could result in tariffs on older types of chips from China, though the decision would ultimately fall to Trump. ByAna Swanson Ana Swanson covers international trade and is based in Washington. The Biden administration is preparing a trade investigation into China’s production of older-model semiconductors, in response to fears that the United States’ growing dependence on these products could pose a national security threat, according to people familiar with the matter and government and industry documents reviewed by The New York Times. The investigation could ultimately result in tariffs, import bans or other actions on certain Chinese chips and the products that contain them. But the decision about what course to take would fall to the incoming Trump administration. The Biden administration may initiate its investigation in the coming weeks, but it would most likely take at least six months to conclude. The U.S. government has already tried to clamp down on China’saccessto themost advancedtypes of semiconductorsdue to national security concerns. But it has largely left untouched China’s production of older types of chips, which are still vital for powering a huge swath of products including smartphones, cars, dishwashers, refrigerators and weaponry, along with American telecommunications networks. But with Chinese companies and the government now investing heavily in new factories, or fabs, to make those “legacy” or “foundational” chips, U.S. officials are concerned that Chinese production could put chip factories in the United States or allied countries out of business. That could increase U.S. supply chain dependence on China and potentially pose cybersecurity threats as those chips are integrated into American infrastructure or weaponry. “China is subsidizing those chips in these new fabs, dumping them into the global market and tanking the price,” Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif., on Dec. 7. “That isn’t fair. And there may be a case for tariffs on that.” The Biden administration has been weighing whether to proceed with a trade investigation under two different laws. One is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which focuses on threats to national security and falls to the Commerce Department. The other option is Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to acts that are “unjustifiable” or “unreasonable” and burden U.S. commerce, and is carried out by the Office of the United States Trade Representative.

Sudden Loss of Undocumented Workers Threw Tech Supplier Into Upheaval,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/us/immigration-undocumented-workers-jabil.html,"Advertisement Supported by Jabil says it required “herculean efforts” to replace employees from a staffing agency. Other businesses are bracing for “an enforcement storm” under President-elect Trump. BySteve Eder Steve Eder is part of a team of reporters investigating staffing agencies’ role in filling jobs with immigrants who are in the country illegally. Jabil, a major manufacturer of electronics components for the tech industry, made a startling discovery in the spring of 2021: It had been relying on dozens of undocumented workers, contracted from a staffing agency, to power its manufacturing sites near Silicon Valley. Jabil insisted they be fired, setting off what it called a “mass exodus” from its work force that required expensive and “herculean efforts” to find replacements, including hosting job fairs and borrowing workers from a client. The upheaval caused the company to fall behind on both existing orders and bids for new business, costing it up to $50 million, according to interviews and allegations in an ongoing lawsuit against the staffing agency. How Jabil navigated the sudden loss of undocumented workers — years before Donald J. Trump won re-election on a pledge of mass deportations of illegal immigrants — foreshadows the possible road ahead for companies that rely on staffing agencies to fill jobs at factories, warehouses and distribution centers. The New York Times reported in November thatstaffing firms were among the top employers of unauthorized workersat work sites inspected for immigration violations over the past decade. Now with Mr. Trump’s victory, some firms are fearing the worst. Toby Malara, vice president for government relations at the American Staffing Association, a trade group, said in an interview that the “business community at large” has been urging the incoming Trump administration “not to go forward with the mass deportations.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"E.B. Furgurson III, Who Covered Massacre at His Newspaper, Dies at 70",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/business/media/eb-furgurson-iii-dead.html,"Advertisement Supported by After five people were killed in the newsroom, he set up a work space in the back of his pickup truck and made sure the next day’s issue was published. ByRichard Sandomir E.B. Furgurson III, a reporter who, after five of his colleagues at the Maryland newspaper The Capital were massacred in their newsroom by a grudge-fueled gunman, helped produce the next day’s issue from his pickup truck, died on Nov. 25 in Annapolis, Md. He was 70. His wife, Rebecca (Bisgood) Furgurson, said his death, in a hospital, was caused by an “extended illness.” On June 28, 2018, Mr. Furgurson — who, like his father, also a journalist, was known as Pat — had gone for lunch at the food court at the Westfield Annapolis Mall, across the street from the newspaper, when he received a text about the shootings, which killed four of his fellow journalists, Rob Hiaasen, Wendi Winters, John McNamara and Gerald Fischman, and Rebecca Smith, a sales assistant. The gunman, Jarrod W. Ramos, had held a grudge against the paper for publishing an article in 2011 about his guilty plea in a harassment case. In 2021, he was sentenced to six consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, one for each of the five people he killed and one for attempted murder. Mr. Furgurson quickly left the food court and, in the mall’s garage, turned the back of his pickup truck into a makeshift work space that he shared with a photographer, Josh McKerrow, and a reporter, Chase Cook. While Mr. Furgurson made telephone calls and talked to the police, he became a calming influence to an anxious Mr. McKerrow. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Are Tariffs Inevitable?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/business/dealbook/trump-tariffs-inevitable.html,"Advertisement Newsletter World leaders and C.E.O.s are struggling to convince President-elect Donald Trump to shift his position on imposing new levies against America’s trade partners and its rivals. ByAndrew Ross SorkinRavi MattuBernhard WarnerSarah KesslerMichael J. de la MercedLauren HirschandTariq Panja Investors appear largely unfazed by President-elect Donald Trump’s tough talk on tariffs, with the S&P 500 up more than 5 percent since Election Day. But world leaders and C.E.O.s are worried he could disrupt global trade and pummel profits — and feel they’re making little headway in warning him of the consequences. Companies have stepped up their lobbying to persuade Trump to go easy on tariffs,according to The Wall Street Journal. The president-elect warned last month that he would impose 25 percent levies on the country’s biggest trading partners,Canada and Mexico, if they didn’t tighten their borders and stem the flow of illegal migration to the U.S. In subsequent social media posts, he went after China andBRICS countries, too. Trump’s team is warning businesses to take him at his word on tariffs,The Journal reports. That suggests that Trump, who has called tariffs “the most beautiful word in the dictionary,” isn’t merely using tariff warnings as an opening salvo in trade negotiations. It also calls into question how much say Jamieson Greer, Scott Bessent, Howard Lutnick and Marco Rubio — Trump’s picks for trade representative, and to run the Treasury, Commerce and State departments — will have in shaping Trump’s trade policy if his mind is already made up. Trump conceded that he “can’t guarantee” tariffs won’t hit consumers hard.That’s a concern among economists and big companies such asWalmartandCostco, who fear that levies could lead to price rises. This earnings season, analysts have beenpeppering corporate leadersabout how tariffs might affect their businesses. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Alaska in Winter: Reveling in a Playground of Ice and Snow,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/travel/juneau-budget-skiing.html,"Frugal Traveler Juneau, a popular cruise port in summer, becomes a deal-seeker’s base for skiing, skating, hiking and glacier-gazing in winter. Outside of Juneau, Alaska, a family hits the ice for a skating and hockey session on Mendenhall Lake, just below Mendenhall Glacier.Credit...Christopher Miller for The New York Times Supported by ByElaine Glusac Elaine Glusac is theFrugal Travelercolumnist, focusing on budget-friendly tips and journeys. Twelve inches of fresh powder had just fallen atEaglecrest Ski AreainJuneau, Alaska, when I arrived for my first day of skiing last February. Snow packed the slumping branches of towering pines and frosted the beards of draping moss. From the chairlift, skiers below me appeared from the thighs up, their lower halves plowing fresh tracks. Whoops of delight rang out from sources unseen. Dropping into an intermediate run, I fought the pull of the depths and managed to surf the soft mantle in a joyous ride — whooping all the way. Powder days, I always thought, were for locals and, occasionally, lucky visitors. After all, it’s hard to schedule a trip around an unpredictable snowstorm far enough in advance to get decent airfare. To boost my luck last winter, I relocated to Juneau, the capital of Alaska, for a month. Though better known as a cruise port welcoming 1.6 million ship passengers annually between May and October, it’s also a ski town in the low (and budget-friendly) season. Climate-wise, Juneau is renowned for rain. Surrounded by theTongass National Forest, the world’s largest contiguous temperate rainforest, the destination gets 230 days of rain a year, some of them in winter. But when the conditions are right, the rain turns to snow and freshwater to ice, creating a wonderland for winter fans, like me, who appreciate downhill and cross-country skiing as well as skating, hiking, cultural diversions off-piste and culinary intrigue after dark.

See How Much NYC's Congestion Pricing Plan Would Cost You,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/15/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-cost.html,"Rideshares ByAna Ley,Rebecca LiebermanandEden Weingart Most drivers will begin paying new congestion tolls on Jan. 5 to reach the heart of Manhattan, if all goes as planned. The fees are meant to relieve some of the world’s worst gridlock and pollution while raisingbillions of dollarsfor important upgrades to New York City’s subways and buses. Officials also hope to persuade people to use public transit instead. Along 61st St. Lincoln Tunnel Queensboro Bridge Queens- Midtown Tunnel Holland Tunnel Williamsburg Bridge Manhattan Bridge Brooklyn Bridge Hugh L. Carey Tunnel Along 61st St. Lincoln Tunnel Queensboro Bridge Queens- Midtown Tunnel Holland Tunnel Williamsburg Bridge Manhattan Bridge Brooklyn Bridge Hugh L. Carey Tunnel Along 61st St. Lincoln Tunnel Queensboro Bridge Queens- Midtown Tunnel Holland Tunnel Williamsburg Bridge Manhattan Bridge Brooklyn Bridge Hugh L. Carey Tunnel Congestion pricing has been debated for decades, and opponents have fought hard to diminish or stop the tolls, which would bethe first of its kind in the United States. Under public pressure, Gov. Kathy Hochul had blocked the program just weeks before its original start date in June. At the time, she cited concerns about the possible impact that the tolls could have on New York’s economy,an idea disputed by many experts. When she revived the program in November, she introduced a 40 percent discount in rates across the board for several years. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs the city’s subway and buses and two commuter rail lines,plans to phase in higher rates later. Officials are racing to implementthe programbefore President-elect Donald J. Trump, a powerful opponent who has promised to end the project, takes office on Jan. 20. And at least 10 lawsuitscould still unravel the planahead of its start date. Here is a closer look at how the tolls would work for most drivers. Click the dropdowns below to see more options The program has been designed to reduce the volume of personal automobiles because they make up a large share of Manhattan’s traffic.  There would be a cap of one toll per day for passenger vehicles entering the designated tolling zone. The base toll for personal cars has been set at a higher amount than for motorcycles, taxis or ride-hail vehicles in hopes of encouraging drivers to use mass transit or other options, like carpooling, that contribute less to traffic. Those enrolled in the E-ZPass system would pay a lower fee than if they were not. TheE-ZPass systemis used by many East Coast states to collect tolls on bridges and highways, and transportation officials say it is the most efficient method to charge drivers. Those traveling over a bridge that is not tolled otherwise would pay the base toll and not receive a credit.  Those who would pay the new toll with E-ZPass would receive an additional credit if they would exit the zone using the Queens-Midtown and Hugh L. Carey Tunnels, regardless of entry point. The base toll would apply during the most congested hours: from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. Click the dropdowns below to see more options Taxis and app-based ride-hail services such as Uber and Lyft are a significant source of traffic in Manhattan, and passengers who use them already pay other congestion fees. Passengers in these vehicles — not drivers — would pay a new fee per trip into, out of and within the zone.  The average fare in 2023 for trips in the zone, without tip, was $26 for taxis and $36 for passengers using ride-hail apps, according to transportation officials. Taxis made an average of 12 daily trips and ride-hail vehicles made six. The fee for passengers in taxis would be slightly lower than for passengers in ride-hail vehicles, which make fewer trips and are more likely to idle in the zone. Public officials want to avoid driving customers away from the struggling taxi industry. Taxi drivershave faced many challengesover the past decade, such as predatory loans and the rise of for-hire apps. Click the dropdowns below to see more options One of the goals of congestion pricing is to reduce air pollution in and around Manhattan. Trucks are some of the biggest contributors to noise, smog and other pollutants around busy roads.Buses also take up much more spaceand contribute more to congestion compared with smaller vehicles.  There would be no daily cap on tolled trips made by trucks or buses. These vehicles, like those used as U-Hauls and for package deliveries, would be charged lower tolls than large trucks and tour buses. But their fees would be higher than those for passenger vehicles because they still take up a large amount of space on the road and can cause delays while driving and turning. Drivers enrolled in the E-ZPass system would pay a lower fee than if they were not. TheE-ZPass systemis used by many East Coast states to collect tolls on bridges and highways, and transportation officials say it is the most efficient method to charge drivers. Drivers traveling through a tunnel with a pre-existing toll would be granted a credit to offset the cost of the new toll.  Drivers who would pay the new toll with E-ZPass would receive an additional credit if they would exit the zone using the Queens-Midtown and Hugh L. Carey Tunnels, regardless of entry point. Peak fees would apply during the most congested hours: from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. Officials want to discourage deliveries and commercial traffic during these hours. Click the dropdowns below to see more options Transit officials have tried to keep the new toll affordable by establishing tax credits and discounts for people with low incomes who would have to drive into the zone for work. But this would be avery small fraction of drivers.  Out of the 22 million people who live in the region and the 1.5 million who work in the zone, an estimated 16,000 people with household incomes under $50,000 drive to work into the zone. Thatrepresents only 1 percent of its workers, according to a recent analysis of federal demographic data. Some workers who earn less than $50,000 per year may have no alternative to driving to work in the zone. Because the toll may pose a financial hardship, they could sign up for a program that would provide a 50 percent discount from the peak toll price after their first 10 trips in a calendar month. The discount would not apply for off-peak toll rates.  Low-income residents of the congestion zone who make less than $60,000 a yearcould apply for a state tax credit. Click the dropdowns below to see more options Public officials have tried to keep exemptions to a minimum in order, they say, to evenly balance the burden of the new tolls among drivers, to discourage drivers from using vehicles in the zone as much as possible and to aim for generating $15 billion to pay for better subways and buses. When state lawmakers established the program in 2019, they shielded emergency vehicles from paying the tolls. Those vehicles would include ambulances, police vehicles, correction vehicles, fire vehicles and blood delivery vehicles. Manhattan’s new tolling program is still being challenged in federal and state courts, with rulings possible before it begins on Jan. 5. Gov. Kathy Hochul has fast-tracked the new tolls to enter Midtown and Lower Manhattan. Drivers could be charged beginning in January. New York City is constantly changing, opening the door to both new battles over traffic and radical solutions. Notes: Each mock trip represents a single entry into the congestion pricing zone from either outside the zone, or in the case of excluded roadways, from the non-tolled portions of the zone.Congestion fee totals listed in each section refer to tolls and credits that would be applied as part of the new congestion-pricing program, and do not factor in the cost of other existing tolls.Smaller vehicles, like bicycles, mopeds and scooters, would not be tolled.With a complex system like this, there are bound to be nuanced edge cases. Generally, if a vehicle can pass through the zone via elevated ramps without touching down on surface streets within the zone, it would not be charged the congestion fee. If a vehicle touches down on surface streets in order to connect from one elevated ramp to another, then it would be tolled. Source: Toll trip data is fromthe Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

"Google’s Sundar Pichai on Antitrust, Trump and A.I.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/business/dealbook/sundar-pichai-dealbook.html,"DealBookSummit Advertisement Newsletter Google’s chief executive spoke with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Summit ByAndrew Ross SorkinandSarah Kessler Google got a head start in the artificial intelligence race, and at the DealBook Summit on Dec. 4, its chief executive, Sundar Pichai, snapped back at suggestions that it should be more competitive considering its vast resources. Whereas A.I. startups rely on tech giants for processing power, Google uses its own. The company’s products, like YouTube and Gmail, give it access tomountains of data, and its A.I. researchers have made huge breakthroughs, with two of themwinning a Nobel Prize this year. That gives Google an advantage in all three of what Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, earlier in the day called “key inputs” to A.I. progress:compute, data and algorithms. Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has said that Google should have been the “default winner” in A.I. At the DealBook Summit, Pichai responded, “I would love to do a side-by-side comparison of Microsoft’s own models and our models any day, any time.” Microsoft largely depends on OpenAI for its A.I. models. Pichai also defended his company’s competitiveness. He said that although he thought A.I. progress would slow in the next year (speaking earlier, Altman hada different take), Google’s search engine “will continue to change profoundly in ’25.” He said he expected search to become more, not less, valuable as the web is flooded with content generated by A.I. Pichai also touched on the company’s antitrust lawsuits, the second Trump administration and how artificial intelligence is affecting the way he hires. Here are five highlights from the conversation.

"Four Years Later, CrossFit’s Disgraced Guru Attempts a Comeback",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/style/greg-glassman-crossfit-metfix.html,"Greg Glassman, who sold the company amid sexual harassment complaints, has a new health and fitness venture. It sounds a lot like his old one. The kettlebell weights at New Species CrossFit in Royal Oak, Mich., may soon be used for Greg Glassman’s new venture: MetFix.Credit...Nic Antaya for The New York Times Supported by ByCalum Marsh In the summer of 2021, Josh Hunnicutt, a longtime personal trainer and the owner of the New Species CrossFit gym in Royal Oak, Mich., had a surprising opportunity: Greg Glassman, CrossFit’s contentious but charismatic co-founder, offered — more or less out of the blue — to pick him up in his private jet and fly him to a party in Ohio. The pitch was for the two of them to drink vodka sodas and rub elbows with other luminaries of the health and fitness industry. Mr. Hunnicutt couldn’t say exactly why Mr. Glassman had singled him out with this invitation — “I randomly caught his attention, I think because I mentioned all my daddy issues,” he speculated in a recent video interview. But after spending time with Mr. Glassman, he was duly impressed. “It was the most surreal experience,” he said. “People say, ‘Don’t meet your heroes, because you’ll be disappointed.’ But Greg is Greg.” Mr. Hunnicutt described himself as “the most basic version of a CrossFit box owner there is,” with “the pit bull, the tattoos and the wife who also does CrossFit.” His gym was founded in 2008 in the basement of a Y.M.C.A., and for 16 years it has scrupulously followed the philosophy of fitness that Mr. Glassman, a former gymnast, expounded on the CrossFit website in the early 2000s — a simple but revolutionary methodology based on “constantly varied, high-intensity functional movements,” which spawned a brand worth billions that has been adopted in more than 12,000 gyms across 140 countries. But while his facility will continue to offer CrossFit training, Mr. Hunnicutt will be among the first gym owners to promote Mr. Glassman’s new fitness offering: MetFix, an “invite-only community” of gyms and trainersthat bills itselfas an “evolution of Greg Glassman’s methodology.” Part functional fitness program with movements in the vein of CrossFit, part nutrition program that advises against sugar and carbs, it’s designed to “cut through the epidemic of chronic disease that’s killing millions and bankrupting nations.” Or, as Mr. Hunnicutt described it, “it’s a grown and sexy version of CrossFit, with a little bit more on the critical thinking.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Isak Andic, Founder of Mango Fashion Chain, Dies at 71",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/obituaries/isak-andic-dead.html,"Advertisement Supported by Mr. Andic got his start by selling T-shirts in Barcelona in the mid-1980s. He died in a fall during a hike. ByTim Balk Isak Andic, who built the fashion brand Mango from a Spanish storefront into a global giant with more than 2,000 stores on five continents, died in a fall while hiking near Barcelona on Saturday. He was 71. Thedeath was announcedby Toni Ruiz, the chief executive of Mango. The cause was confirmed by Glòria Torrent Caldas, a spokeswoman for the company. Mr. Andic, bespectacled andseen as relatively reclusive, started Mango in the mid-1980s by selling T-shirts in Barcelona. Over four decades, Mango grew into one of Spain’s leading international retailers, known for its creative, eclectic and ever-changing selection of affordable women’s wear. Mr. Andic, who held the title of nonexecutive chairman at Mango, had a net worth of roughly $4.5 billion at the time of his death,according to Forbes magazine. Mr. Ruiz said in astatementthat Mr. Andic had dedicated his life to Mango, displaying “strategic vision” and “inspiring leadership.” “His legacy reflects the achievements of a business project marked by success and also by his human quality,” Mr. Ruizsaid in the statement. Mango expanded beyond Spain in 1992 and opened its first U.S. location, in Los Angeles, in 2006. By 2008, it had launched a menswear line andopened an 8,000-square-foot storein the SoHo section of Manhattan. In 2011, it held itsfirst fashion showoutside Spain. Mango’s success, in part based on a nimble approach that involved frequently replacing its merchandise, led to its growth in more than 100 markets. Over the years, it hasreceived some scrutinyfor safety lapses along its supply chain. This year, Mango expanded its footprint in the United States, opening locations for the first time in Pennsylvania and in Washington, D.C.,according to the company’s website.The company, which competes with fast fashion chains such as the Swedish-based H&M and the Spanish-based Zara, plans to have 40 American stores at year’s end, up from 10 in 2022. Mr. Andic’s death prompted tributes from Spanish leaders, including the country’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, whoissued a statementpraising Mr. Andic’s business acumen and offering condolences to his family. Isak Andic Ermay was born in 1953 in Istanbul. As a teenager, he moved with his family to Barcelona, and he worked in the wholesale and retail sectors before opening Mango. A full list of Mr. Andic’s survivors was not immediately available. But Jonathan Andic, his son, is anexecutive board member at Mango. Mr. Ruiz said in his statement that Mr. Andic’s death “leaves a huge void, but we are all, in some way, his legacy and the testimony of his achievements. “In these extremely difficult times,” Mr. Ruiz added, “we share the family’s pain as if it were our own.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABC to Pay $15 Million to Settle a Defamation Suit Brought by Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/business/media/trump-abc-settlement.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Supported by The outcome of the lawsuit marks an unusual victory for President-elect Donald J. Trump in his ongoing legal campaign against national news organizations. ByMichael M. GrynbaumandAlan Feuer ABC News is set to pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Donald J. Trump. The agreement was a significant concession by a major news organization and a rare victory for a media-bashing politician whose previous litigation efforts against news outlets have often ended in defeat. Under the terms of a settlement revealed on Saturday, ABC News will donate the $15 million to Mr. Trump’s future presidential foundation and museum. The network and its star anchor, George Stephanopoulos, also published a statement saying they “regret” remarks made about Mr. Trump during a televised interview in March. ABC News, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, will pay Mr. Trump an additional $1 million for his legal fees. The outcome is an unusual win for Mr. Trump, who has frequently sued news organizations for defamation and frequently lost, including in litigation against CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post. Several experts in media law said they believed that ABC News could have continued to fight, given the high threshold required by the courts for a public figure like Mr. Trump to prove defamation. A plaintiff must not only show that a news outlet published false information, but that it did so knowing that the information was false or with substantial doubts about its accuracy. “Major news organizations have often been very leery of settlements in defamation suits brought by public officials and public figures, both because they fear the dangerous pattern of doing so and because they have the full weight of the First Amendment on their side,” said RonNell Andersen Jones, a professor of law at the University of Utah.

"Sam Altman on Microsoft, Trump and Musk",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/business/dealbook/sam-altman-dealbook.html,"DealBookSummit Advertisement Newsletter The OpenAI C.E.O. spoke with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Summit. ByAndrew Ross SorkinandSarah Kessler Since kicking off the artificial intelligence boom with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI has amassed more than 300 million weekly users and a $157 billion valuation. Its C.E.O.,Sam Altman, addressed whether that staggering pace of growth can continue at the DealBook Summit last week. Altman pushed back on assertions that progress in A.I. is becoming slower and more expensive; on reports thatthe company’s relationship with its biggest investor, Microsoft, is fraying; and on concerns that Elon Musk, whofounded an A.I. company last year, may use his relationship with President-elect Donald Trump to hurt competitors. Altman said that artificial general intelligence, the point at which artificial intelligence can do almost anything that a human brain can do, will arrive “sooner than most people in the world think.” Here are five highlights from the conversation. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI, has become one of its major antagonists. He hassued the company, accusing it of departing from its founding mission as a nonprofit, and started a competing startup called xAI. On Friday, OpenAI said Musk had wanted to turn OpenAI into a for-profit company in 2017 and walked away when he didn’t get majority equity. Altman called the change in the relationship “tremendously sad.” He continued: I grew up with Elon as like a mega hero. I thought what Elon was doing was absolutely incredible for the world, and I’m still, of course, I mean, I have different feelings about him now, but I’m still glad he exists. I mean that genuinely. Not just because I think his companies are awesome, which I do think, but because I think at a time when most of the world was not thinking very ambitiously, he pushed a lot of people, me included, to think much more ambitiously. And grateful is the wrong kind of word. But I’m like thankful. You know, we started OpenAI together, and then at some point he totally lost faith in OpenAI and decided to go his own way. And that’s fine, too. But I think of Elon as a builder and someone who — a known thing about Elon is that he really cares about being ‘the guy.’ But I think of him as someone who, if he’s not, that just competes in the market and in the technology, and whatever else. And doesn’t resort to lawfare. And, you know, whatever the stated complaint is, what I believe is he’s a competitor and we’re doing well. And that’s sad to see. Altman said of Musk’s close relationship with Trump: I may turn out to be wrong, but I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to the degree that Elon has it to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses. And I don’t think people would tolerate that. I don’t think Elon would do it. Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, has put more than $13 billion into the company and has an exclusive license to its raw technologies. Altman once called the relationship “the best bromance in tech,” but The Times and others have reported that the partnershiphas become strainedas OpenAI seeks more and cheaper access to computing power and Microsoft has made moves to diversify its access to A.I. technology. OpenAIexpects to lose $5 billion this yearbecause of the steep costs of developing A.I. At the DealBook Summit, Altman said of the relationship with Microsoft, “I don’t think we’re disentangling. I will not pretend that there are no misalignments or challenges.” He added: We need lots of compute, more than we projected. And that has just been an unusual thing in the history of business, to scale that quickly. And there’s been tension on that. Some of OpenAI’s own products compete with those of partners that depend on its technologies. On whether that presents a conflict of interest, Altman said: We have a big platform business. We have a big first party business. Many other companies manage both of those things. And we have things that we’re really good at. Microsoft has things they’re really good at. Again, there’s not no tension, but on the whole, our incentives are pretty aligned. On whether making progress in A.I. development was becoming more expensive and slower, as some experts have suggested, he doubled down on a message he’d previously posted on social media: “There is no wall.” Andrew asked the same question ofSundar Pichai, the Google C.E.O., which we’ll recap in tomorrow’s newsletter.

"In Display of Fealty, Tech Industry Curries Favor With Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/technology/trump-tech-amazon-meta-openai.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Supported by It was a week of frenzied activity, as Silicon Valley billionaires and their companies brandished checks and compliments for the President-elect. ByTheodore SchleiferandDavid Yaffe-Bellany The $1 million donations came gradually — and then all at once. Meta.Amazon.OpenAI’s Sam Altman. Each of these Silicon Valley companies or their leaders promised to support President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inaugural committee with seven-figure checks over the past week, often accompanied by a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to bend the knee. The procession of tech leaders who traveled to hobnob with Mr. Trump face-to-face included Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, and Sergey Brin, a Google founder, who together dined with Mr. Trump on Thursday.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, shared a meal with Mr. Trump on Friday. And Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, planned to meet with Mr. Trump in the next few days. This was the week when many tech companies and their top executives, as reluctant as they may have been, acknowledged the reality of getting business done in Mr. Trump’s Washington. With their donations, visits and comments, they joined a party that has already raged for a month, as a cohort of influential Silicon Valley billionaires, led by Elon Musk,began running partsof Mr. Trump’s transition after endorsing him in the campaign. While businesses frequently try to get on an incoming president’s good side, the frenzy of tech activity stood out from other industries. Until President Obama’s administration, the tech industry had largely stayed aloof from politics. Some wrote just small checks for Mr. Trump’s first inauguration. Now the bread-breaking with Mr. Trump has become highly public. Meta and Amazon, whose founders had previously been criticized by Mr. Trump, said they would donate $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inaugural fund this week. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, the high-profile artificial intelligence start-up, said on Friday that a $1 million donation to Mr. Trump’s inaugural fund would come from him personally.

"In Port Labor Dispute, Trump Backed a Union That Courted Him",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/business/economy/trump-ila-port-strike.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Supported by President-elect Donald J. Trump is supporting the International Longshoremen’s Association, which could strike soon if it doesn’t reach a deal on automation with employers. ByPeter Eavis Leaders of some labor unions tried to establish good relations with Donald J. Trump before the election — and for one of them, that effort may already be paying off. President-elect Trump lent his support on Thursday to the International Longshoremen’s Association, which represents dockworkers on the East and Gulf Coasts. Contract negotiations between the union and employers have broken down over the use of port machinery that can move cargo without human involvement. The I.L.A. opposes it, believing it reduces jobs, but the employers, mainly large shipping companies, have said that the equipment moves goods more cheaply and efficiently. Writing on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he had met with I.L.A. leaders and that he sympathized with the union’s fears. “I’ve studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,” he said. “The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt, and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.” The unionsuspended a short strike in Octoberafter securing a large wage increase, and agreed to keep negotiating with port operators until Jan. 15 on other parts of the contract, including provisions on how much automated machinery can be used. Mr. Trump won a second presidential term with the support of many union members, and he has vowed to protect American workers. And while it is unclear how much he will do to help the labor movement broadly, his backing of the I.L.A. suggests he could strengthen the hand of unions that have courted him.

U.S. Court Denies TikTok’s Request to Freeze Sale-or-Ban Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/business/us-court-tiktok-sale-or-ban.html,"Advertisement Supported by TikTok had sought to temporarily freeze a law that requires its Chinese parent to sell the app or face a U.S. ban next month. The case may now head to the Supreme Court. BySapna Maheshwari A federal court on Friday denied TikTok’s request to temporarily freeze a law that requires its Chinese parent company to sell the app or face a ban in the United States as of Jan. 19, a decision that puts the fate of the app in the Supreme Court’s hands. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said in a filinglate on Fridaythat an injunction was “unwarranted,” and that it had expedited its decision so that TikTok and its users could seek an emergency freeze from the Supreme Court. A week ago,three judges in the same court unanimously denied petitions from the company and its users to overturn the law. TikTok thenaskedthe court on Monday to temporarily block the law until the Supreme Court decided on TikTok’s planned appeal of that decision, and sought a decision by Dec. 16. The court said on Friday that TikTok and its users “have not identified any case in which a court, after rejecting a constitutional challenge to an Act of Congress, has enjoined the Act from going into effect while review is sought in the Supreme Court.” It isn’t clear whether the Supreme Court will agree to temporarily freeze the law and hear the case, though experts say that is likely. Michael Hughes, a spokesman for TikTok, said, “As we have previously stated, we plan on taking this case to the Supreme Court, which has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech.” He said that American users’ voices would be “silenced” if the law were not stopped.

"Gerd Heidemann, Journalist Duped by Fake Hitler Diaries, Dies at 93",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/business/media/gerd-heidemann-dead.html,"Advertisement Supported by What was supposed to be the crowning scoop of his career became his downfall when a trove of notebooks he acquired in Germany turned out to be forgeries. ByClay Risen Gerd Heidemann, a globe-trotting, high-flying German journalist who thought he had landed the scoop of the century — the private diaries of Adolf Hitler — but who came crashing back to earth after they were exposed as crude forgeries, died on Monday at a hospital in Hamburg, Germany. He was 93. Thomas Weber, a history professor at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland who was in close contact with Mr. Heidemann, confirmed the death. Mr. Heidemann was one of the most highly paid correspondents in Germany when, at a news conference in 1983, he revealed what he said were 62 notebooks in which Hitler had written his innermost thoughts. He told reporters that he had bought them from a dissident East German general who found them in a barn near Leipzig. The notebooks, Mr. Heidemann said at the time, offered groundbreaking insights into the Nazi leader’s thinking. Among other things, they seemed to indicate that Hitler was largely unaware of the Holocaust — and also that he had bad breath, chronic flatulence and a rocky relationship with his mistress, Eva Braun. An accompanying editorial in Stern, the magazine where Mr. Heidemann worked, declared that thanks to Mr. Heidemann, “the biography of the dictator and with it the history of the Nazi regime will be largely rewritten.” But his story began to unravel almost immediately, revealing a long trail of deception, delusion and comic ineptitude.

Charles Handy Dies at 92; Philosopher Envisioned Today’s Corporate World,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/business/charles-handy-dead.html,"Advertisement Supported by Joining a pantheon of management thinkers, he embraced a humanistic path for business and foresaw outsourcing, remote work and a gig economy. ByGlenn Rifkin Charles Handy, a writer, social philosopher and management theorist who presciently imagined a brave new corporate world where employees worked remotely, jobs were outsourced and workers had “portfolio careers,” working for themselves and contracting their skills to companies, died on Friday at his home in London. He was 92. His son, Scott, confirmed the death. Mr. Handy, the son of an Irish Protestant vicar, brought a humanistic social philosophy to the business world with the unconventional suggestion that corporations were too focused on profit at the expense of the individual and the human aspect of work. He said businesses should behave like communities or villages, treating employees like citizens who have rights and privileges and a share in the profits. It was just common sense, he reasoned, that people were more likely to be committed to their work and a company’s mission if they had a hand in shaping it. Ranked among a pantheon of management thinkers that includesPeter Drucker,Tom Peters,Michael PorterandWarren Bennis, Mr. Handy predicted organizational trends years before they materialized as corporate realities. His seminal 1989 book,“The Age of Unreason,”which put him on the map as a management expert and provocative prophet, described the late 20th century as being in the midst of what he called “discontinuous” change — profound social and economic shifts that were transforming business, education and the very nature of work and rendering the past useless as a guide for navigating what comes next. He predicted decentralized, community-oriented “federal organizations,” in which a small corporate headquarters served the needs of diverse and far-flung business units. The corporate center would retain key financial control, but the creative and production energy would lie with workers who were closest to the customers.

BySapna Maheshwari A federal judge in San Francisco said on Thursday that a former executive at ByteDance lied in statements to the court and seemed to have fabricated an important witness in a high-profile case against the company. Yintao Yu, the head of engineering for ByteDance’s U.S. operations from August 2017 to November 2018,filed a wrongful dismissal suitagainst the company in May 2023. In the filing, Mr. Yu claimed that ByteDance’s Beijing offices had a special unit of Chinese Communist Party members, sometimes referred to as the Committee, which monitored the company’s apps and “guided how the company advanced core Communist values.” ByteDance is the Chinese company that owns TikTok. The claims caught widespread attention as American lawmakers debated whether TikTok was a national security threat under Chinese ownership. But Susan Illston, the federal judge overseeing the case in the U. S. District Court in Northern California, said that Mr. Yu “engaged in serious, bad faith conduct that has abused the judicial process.” Mr. Yu’s case relied in part on a declaration from an anonymous ByteDance employee about certain employment records, and the judge said that Mr. Yu seemed to have “fabricated the anonymous declaration.” According to the judge, Mr. Yu also perjured himself in documents related to that anonymous employee, and in other filings with the court, as well. His “obstructive and mendacious conduct has caused delay, required additional motion practice, and vexatiously multiplied these proceedings,” the judge wrote in a filing. Ms. Illston’s order will require Mr. Yu to return to private arbitration to mediate his dispute with ByteDance. ByteDance said last year that Mr. Yu’s claims and allegations were “baseless.” On Friday, a spokesman for TikTok declined to comment beyond what was said in the filings. A lawyer for Mr. Yu declined to comment. The legal win for ByteDance and TikTok comes at a precarious time for the company. Under a new law, ByteDance must sell TikTok or face a ban in the United States as of Jan. 19. A House committee sent letters to the chief executives of Apple and Google on Friday, warning them to comply with the law in the absence of the divestment of TikTok by ByteDance. The law requires app store operators like Apple and Google to stop distributing and updating the TikTok app. Apple did not respond to a request for comment on its plans to comply with the law. Google declined to comment. The committee urged TikTok’s chief executive to pursue a sale in a separate letter. TikTokhas asked afederal court to temporarily freeze the law, in the hope of a rescue by the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration. Nico Grant contributed reporting.

Bill Belichick Has Stores Cutting the Sleeves Off Sweatshirts,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/style/bill-belichick-north-carolina.html,"Advertisement Supported by Chapel Hill has embraced North Carolina’s hiring of a legendary N.F.L. coach, with “Chapel Bill” shirts and cutoff hoodies. ByScott Cacciola As rumors circulated this week thatBill Belichickcould become the new football coach at the University of North Carolina, Jamie Mottram knew that his company needed to be prepared. Mr. Mottram is the president ofBreakingT, a sports fan apparel company that specializes in viral moments. Juan Soto signs with the Mets? BreakingT went straight to its production facility for a fresh heap of “Juan Solo,” “Juan Gone” and “Do the Soto Shuffle” T-shirts. Jake Bates nails a game-winning field goal for the Detroit Lions? Perhaps BreakingT can interest you in a “Legatron” hoodie. Keenly aware that Mr. Belichick’s unconventional move to the college ranks had the potential to set the sports world ablaze, Mr. Mottram was thrilled when Sam Franco, BreakingT’s product manager, came up with a nifty nickname: Chapel Bill, which was, of course, a play on the school’s location in Chapel Hill, N.C. “That’s great!” Mr. Mottram recalled telling Mr. Franco. “That’s so clever.” Yet by the time Mr. Belichick’s hiring became official on Wednesday, Chapel Bill was not merely an idea that was floating in the ether at BreakingT’s corporate headquarters in Arlington, Va. The nickname already belonged to the world — and, more specifically, to apparel shops in Chapel Hill that pounced on the news. “It seemed like everybody had the same idea,” Mr. Mottram said. Such was the rush to find ways to capitalize on one of the most prominent football coaches in N.F.L. history coming to a university more closely associated with basketball. The two main options: a play on his name or a reference to hisaddiction to short-sleeved sweatshirts. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Avant Gardner, Troubled Brooklyn Venue, Promises Security Changes in Major Renovation",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/nyregion/brooklyn-avant-gardner-security.html,"Advertisement Supported by The planned overhaul comes more than a year after two patrons who left the mega-club were found dead nearby. ByRemy Tumin The new chief executive of Avant Gardner, one of Brooklyn’s largest event venues, said the company was overhauling the space and making sweeping security changes. The overhaul comes during a fraught period for the venue, including the deaths of two patrons found nearby last year. Josh Wyatt, who was hired to lead Avant Gardner in October, announced the plans to renovate the East Williamsburg nightclub campus, which houses the Brooklyn Mirage,in a letterthis week. The changes are estimated to cost at least $10 million. “The days of being a bootstrapping, entrepreneurial, sort of underground, roving rave party — those days are over,” Mr. Wyatt said in an interview. New lighting, cellphone towers and signage will be installed to help patrons navigate the industrial neighborhood, Mr. Wyatt said. The club will also increase the number of guest ambassadors, who are trained to use the drug overdose reversal medication Narcan and spot attendees in trouble, from a dozen to up to 24 and increase the number of private patrol vehicles. Avant Gardner will also work with ride-sharing companies on better-marked pickup and drop-off points. The sprawling venue is part of an industrial neighborhood that can be poorly lit, has spotty cell service and is dotted with construction sites. The changes come as Avant Gardner has sought to repair relations with patrons. In recent years, there have been complaints over crowd control, a lawsuit over a failed music festival and the two deaths that chilled the nightlife scene. Mr. Wyatt said that permits for the new cellphone towers were approved this week and that the city had installed new maps around the venue to help guests navigate the area, with plans for more. He said the venue had spent $30,000 cleaning up an area outside the venue that is popular with food trucks to make it easier to see its entrance. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Bank of America Flagged Suspicious Payments to Epstein Only After He Died,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/business/jeffrey-epstein-bank-of-america.html,"Advertisement Supported by Senate staff members are urging that Bank of America be investigated for the way it reported payments to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier. ByMatthew Goldstein When Bank of America alerted financial regulators in 2020 to potentially suspicious payments from Leon Black, the billionaire investor, to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier, the bank was following a routine practice.The bank filed two “suspicious activity reports,” or SARs, which are meant to alert law enforcement to potential criminal activities like money laundering, terrorism financing or sex trafficking. One was filed in February 2020 and the other eight months later, according to a congressional memorandum reviewed by The New York Times. SARs are expected to be filed within 60 days of a bank spotting a questionable transaction. But the warnings in this case, according to the congressional memo, were not filed until several years after the payments, totaling $170 million, had been made. By the time of the first filing, Mr. Epstein had already been dead for six months, after taking his own life in a Manhattan jail following his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges. The delayed filings have led congressional investigators to question if Bank of America violated federal laws against money laundering. Also of concern to investigators is that the bank apparently processed the payments “without asking for information as to the nature of the transactions,” the memo said. The bank told regulators in its initial filing that the wire transfers had “no apparent economic, business or lawful purpose,” according to the memo. The details in the congressional memo also illustrate a problem with the SARs system. Each year banks file millions of these confidential reports with regulators, but it is not uncommon for banks to file them long after the transactions have taken place. Banks may not act because they’re unaware of a reason to dig deeper into a transaction, or they may not want to cause trouble for a wealthy customer, money laundering experts say. The memo, prepared by staff working for Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat and chair of the Senate Finance Committee, recommended that Mr. Wyden ask the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to investigate Bank of America’s conduct. The finance committee has been conductingits own investigationinto the large payments from Mr. Black to Mr. Epstein for nearly two years. A spokesman for Mr. Wyden said he was still considering the recommendations, but was likely to follow through on them. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

McKinsey to Pay $650 Million in Opioid Settlement With Justice Department,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/business/mckinsey-oxycontin-settlement.html,"Advertisement Supported by A former senior partner will also plead guilty to obstruction of justice after destroying company documents. ByWalt BogdanichandMichael Forsythe Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe have reported extensively on McKinsey & Company and written a book on its business dealings. McKinsey & Company has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a Justice Department investigation of its work with the opioid maker Purdue Pharma. A former senior partner has also agreed to plead guilty to obstruction of justice for destroying internal company records in connection with that work. At the center of the government’s case was the global consulting giant’s recommendation that Purdue Pharma “turbocharge” sales of Purdue’s flagship OxyContin painkiller in the midst of an opioid addiction epidemic that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans. The settlement and the government’s findings were presented at a news conference in Boston on Friday. According to prosecutors, McKinsey “knew the risks and dangers associated with OxyContin,” as well as the fact that top Purdue Pharma executives had pleaded guilty to federal crimes relating to sales of the drug. Yet the consulting company chose to continue working with the drugmaker to boost sales of the opioid. More than two dozen McKinsey partners consulted for Purdue over roughly 15 years, earning the firm $93 million. The settlement, which the government said ended its investigation of McKinsey, stemmed from charges brought by the U.S. attorney’s offices in Massachusetts and the Western District of Virginia. The case is unrelated to Purdue Pharma’s multibillion-dollar bankruptcy plan, now in legal limbo, that would have offered compensation to tens of thousands of families. Still, the McKinsey settlement brings closure to one strand of a broad legal effort to grapple with the industry behind the opioid epidemic. McKinsey is widely regarded as the world’s most prestigious management consulting firm, with offices around the globe from which it advises most of the Fortune 500 companies as well as government agencies, including those in authoritarian nations such as China and Saudi Arabia.

Fortnite Players Get Millions in Refunds for Unwanted Purchases,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/arts/fortnite-ftc-refunds.html,"Advertisement Supported by Epic Games is making the payments, which average about $114, after settling accusations from the federal government that the studio tricked people into buying in-game items. ByDerrick Bryson Taylor Fortnite players who were charged for unwanted purchases in the game where cartoony characters battle on a virtual island are starting to receive what could be $245 million in refunds from Epic Games for what the federal government called manipulative online practices. Denver Wills, a 20-year-old college student near Anniston, Ala., who has been playing Fortnite since middle school, said that a friend had received $350 and that he hoped to get a similar amount. It would help him cover the costs of building a new computer. “Any money’s good money at this point,” said Wills, who is waiting for his check in the mail. Fortnite’s in-game currency, V-Bucks, can be spent on cosmetics, weapons and outfits — known as skins — that enable players to make their avatars look like celebrities and fictional characters. To appear as John Wick, a player must spend about $19;the rapper Juice WRLD, who died in 2019, is about $14. When it is not on sale, a bundle of Spider-Man outfits and paraphernalia costs almost $50. Epic agreed in December 2022 toa $520 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commissionthat sent a strong signal that federal officials were taking a more assertive stance toward regulating the tech industry. Customers could ultimately receive $245 million for what the agency called Epic’s use of “dark patterns” to trick millions of players into unwanted purchases. Another $275 million will settle accusations that the studio violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. A representative for Epic, which released Fortnite in 2017, said the company did not have additional comments beyond a statement it made when the settlement was announced. In that statement, Epic said it now asked players to explicitly approve that they wanted their payment information saved. “The old status quo for in-game commerce and privacy has changed, and many developer practices should be reconsidered,”the statement said. “We share the underlying principles of fairness, transparency and privacy that the F.T.C. enforces.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump’s Treasury Pick Is Poised to Test ‘Three Arrows’ Economic Strategy,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/business/trump-bessent-economic-strategy.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Supported by Scott Bessent’s “3-3-3” plan to stimulate growth, reduce the deficit and expand oil production will soon face economic realities. ByAlan RappeportandRebecca F. Elliott Alan Rappeport has covered the Treasury Department during the Biden and Trump administrations. Rebecca F. Elliott covers the energy industry. When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set out to rejuvenate Japan’s economy more than a decade ago, he laid out a strategy known as the “Three Arrows,” which aimed to banish deflation by easing monetary policy, increasing government spending and restructuring the economy so that it was poised for growth. President-elect Donald J. Trump could soon brandish three arrows of his own. Mr. Trump’s Treasury secretary pick, Scott Bessent, has mapped out a three-pronged approach to jump-starting a U.S. economy that has been saddled with inflation and sluggish output. The concept, which he billed during the campaign as his 3-3-3 plan, entails increasing growth to 3 percent, cutting the budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product and raising U.S. energy production by three million barrels of oil per day, or the equivalent in other fuels. A longtime hedge fund investor, Mr. Bessent has been a student of “Abenomics” since his days as the top money manager for the billionaire philanthropist George Soros. In that role, he met regularly with advisers to Mr. Abe and traveled from New York City to Tokyo on a monthly basis. He also famouslybet against the yen. “I became convinced that Abe and his circle of advisers would commit to directing all of the resources of the prime minister’s office to this multipronged and daunting task,” Mr. Bessent wrote ina 2022 essay in The International Economy magazine. While Mr. Trump has made broad economic promises on the campaign trail this year to supercharge the economy, slash the debt and unleash energy production, Mr. Bessent’s benchmarks offer a more specific scorecard against which Mr. Trump’s economic performance can be measured at the end of his term. But reaching those marks will not be easy and will depend on a variety of factors, including how deeply Republicans decide to cut taxes, how high Mr. Trump ratchets up tariffs and how much oil global markets demand.

What the Polio Vaccine Has Meant for Public Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/polio-vaccine-placebo.html,"Advertisement Supported by A lawyer working with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has asked the F.D.A. to withdraw approval of the current shot because it hasn’t been tested against a placebo. Scientists say such a test would be unethical. BySheryl Gay Stolberg On the day in 1955 that Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine was pronounced “80 to 90 percent effective” against the form of the disease that caused paralysis, 500 medical scientists and 150 reporters jammed into an auditorium at the University of Michigan for the announcement. Pots clanged, horns honked and factory whistles blew around the country. In the seven decades since, polio — a disease thatonce killed or paralyzedmore than half a million people around the world each year — has been vanquished in the United States. A lawyer advising Robert F. Kennedy Jr.has asked the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the current polio vaccine, a successor to the Salk vaccine, because it has not been tested against a placebo. Experts say the move would be disastrous, because the polio virus is still around. “We would have big outbreaks of polio,” warned Dr. Walter Orenstein, who ran immunization programs for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the late 1980s and 1990s. Because some people infected with polio are asymptomatic, Dr. Orenstein said, the virus could spread through the population unnoticed — until people started getting paralyzed. The Salk vaccine was tested against a placebo in 1.8 million American first- and second-grade schoolchildren in a so-called double-blind placebo-controlled trial — the gold standard in American medicine, in which half the study subjects get an inert vaccine and doctors, parents and patients did not know who got which. Salk himself objected to the use of a placebo during the clinical trial; he couldn’t imagine depriving a child of a lifesaving vaccine. As the petition before the F.D.A. notes, the current vaccine, manufactured by Sanofi, was not tested against a placebo; scientists and doctors almost universally agree that withholding a lifesaving vaccine would be unethical.

Tired of Tipping? Holidays May Be the Exception.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/your-money/tipping-etiquette-holidays.html,"Advertisement Supported by your money adviser Consumers have said they are confused and frustrated with tipping expectations generally. But, one expert says, “people generally want to feel more generous around the holidays.” ByAnn Carrns The tradition of holiday tips to thank service workers endures, even as Americans have gotten tired of the regular requests for tips the rest of the year. More people said they planned to tip workers like housekeepers, child care providers and trash collectors at the holidays this year than in previous years, according toa surveypublished this weekby the financial website Bankrate, which began polling in 2021. A significant majority of those surveyed said they tipped “to say thank you.” “Holiday tipping has held its own,” said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at the site, even though the typical amounts people expected to givewere mostly flatwith previous years. (The online survey of about 2,400 adults was conducted in late October and early November.) The subject of tipping has become more fraught in recent years. Surveys show that consumers are confused and frustrated with tipping expectations generally. That’s particularly true for the suggested amounts on payment screens that confront patrons of coffee shops, delivery services, food trucks and ride sharing companies. The Pew Research Center publisheda surveylast year in which most Americans said that tipping was expected in more places than it was five years earlier. And a separate Bankrate survey last summer found that a third of those responding considered tipping culture in the United States to be “out of control.” Yet misgivings about tipping apparently carry an asterisk when it comes to the December holidays. “A lot of people are fed up with tipping, but it does seem the holidays are a special case,” Mr. Rossman said. Academic research backs that up — at least, when it comes to tipping in sit-down restaurants. Sit-down meals are one area where there is some agreement, the Pew survey found. More than nine of 10 respondents said they “often” or “always” left a tip in that setting. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

The Fed Is Stuck Fighting the Last War,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/business/federal-reserve-inflation-target.html,"U.S. Economy Advertisement Supported by Strategies Mired in a battle to contain surging prices, the central bank also needs to be nimble enough for the economic downturns to come, our columnist says. ByJeff Sommer Jeff Sommer writesStrategies, a weekly column on markets, finance and the economy. The battle against inflation during the Biden years is almost behind us. But we’re in danger of learning the wrong lessons from it. The Federal Reserve, holding its last meeting of the year this coming week, has been fighting runaway consumer prices for nearly three years. So far, at least, it has managed an unusual feat: The rate of inflation has dropped sharply from its peak and there has been no recession. Yet the Fed is stuck in a difficult place. With prices still rising faster than the central bank’s 2 percent target, the incoming Trump administration will be hypersensitive about inflation, which was a decisive factor in the November elections. At the same time, the new administration’s policies on tariffs and immigration could set off another inflation surge. So the Fed must remain acutely vigilant on the inflation front. But it will have to keep experimenting, to be ready for the curve balls coming from future recessions. Some economists believe the Fed would gain flexibility if it reconsidered its 2 percent inflation target, though they say the central bank can’t take that step now because it is under too much pressure to preserve its own institutional independence. Still, a single-minded focus on inflation could leave the Fed without the right tools for coping with economic downturns ahead. The Fed’s predicament reminds me of a general who is endlessly fighting the last war — conscientiously dissecting the tactics of recent battles and failing to prepare properly for the next ones.

Elon Musk and DOGE vs. Regulators,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/business/dealbook/musk-doge-sec-irs.html,"Advertisement Newsletter The billionaire has needled government agencies, armed with potential influence over their budgets. But some of these organizations are also looking into his interests. ByAndrew Ross SorkinRavi MattuBernhard WarnerSarah KesslerMichael J. de la MercedLauren HirschandBenjamin Mullin Elon Musk remains perhaps the most consequential figure in President-elect Donald Trump’s orbit, with a commission for cutting government spending headed by him and Vivek Ramaswamy — widely known by its acronym, DOGE —promising huge reductions. Federal regulators have become prominent targets for Musk and his allies. But those agencies are continuing to scrutinize the tech billionaire’s interests, raising questions about conflicts. “The SEC is just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work,”Musk posted on Xon Thursday, joining aflurry of right-wing attackson the agency. The impetus for the ire: an appeals court ruling that Nasdaq can’t require diversity on the boards of companies that list on the exchange, a longtime bugbear of conservatives. Ramaswamy wrote on Xof the commission: “When an agency like the SEC is so repeatedly & thoroughly embarrassed in federal court for flouting the law, it loses its legitimacy as a law enforcement body.” That comes after Musk took aim at the I.R.S. last month,when he polled his X followers about what to do with the tax authority’s budget.The overwhelming response: “Deleted.” But the S.E.C. is renewing scrutiny of Musk.He disclosed on X that the regulator had given him an offer tosettle an inquiry into unspecified charges. A letter from Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Musk’s lawyer, claimed that the agency had given them 48 hours to accept or face punishment, as part of an “improperly motivated campaign.” Spiro’s letter also revealed that the commission had reopened an investigation this week into Neuralink, Musk’s brain-implant start-up.

Media Moguls Set the Stage for Deal Mania,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/business/media/comcast-warner-bros-discovery-media-deals.html,"Advertisement Supported by Comcast and Warner Bros. Discovery are rearranging their businesses for mergers and acquisitions. Experts say the next year could transform the media industry. ByBenjamin MullinandLauren Hirsch The people in charge of the world’s biggest media companies are setting the stage for a flurry of deal making. The moguls are orchestrating corporate maneuvers that could usher in a sweeping reordering of the media industry in 2025. Among them are the leaders of Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN; Comcast, the owner of NBC; and John Malone, the influential investor behind Live Nation. In addition, Paramount, the owner of MTV and Nickelodeon, could soon have a new owner in David Ellison, who has access to billions of dollars in capital that could be used to strike additional deals. The starting gun went off in October, when Comcast’s president, Michael Cavanagh, said the company was exploring a spinout of its cable networks, which include SyFy, USA and MSNBC, into a new company. Analysts expect the as-yet-unnamed company togo on a shopping spree, buying up smaller cable networks and peeling off channels from rivals. Mr. Malone, the cable pioneer with stakes in many major entertainment companies, went next. In November, hereplacedhis longtime chief executive, Greg Maffei, in tandem with a sale of the broadband business Liberty Broadband and a spin out of Liberty Live, a major shareholder in the concert promoter Live Nation. Some of Mr. Malone’s investors think another merger, between Liberty Live and Live Nation, is in the offing. On Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was planning to reorganize its company into two big divisions, lumping its traditional TV networks into one group and its streaming and studio businesses into another. In its announcement about the change, the company said it would increase its “strategic flexibility,” corporate argot for creating options to buy and sell things. The company’s shares spiked 15 percent on the news, with investors expecting some kind of transaction. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Kennedy’s Lawyer Has Asked the F.D.A. to Revoke Approval of the Polio Vaccine,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html,"Advertisement Supported by Aaron Siri, who specializes in vaccine lawsuits, has been at Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s side reviewing candidates for top jobs at the Department of Health and Human Services. ByChristina JewettandSheryl Gay Stolberg The lawyer helping Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pick federal health officials for the incoming Trump administration has petitioned the government to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine, which for decades hasprotected millions of peoplefrom a virus that can cause paralysis or death. That campaign is just one front in the war that the lawyer, Aaron Siri, is wagingagainst vaccines of all kinds. Mr. Siri has also filed a petition seeking to pause the distribution of 13 other vaccines; challenged, and in some cases quashed, Covid vaccine mandates around the country; sued federal agencies for the disclosure of records related to vaccine approvals; and subjected prominent vaccine scientists to grueling videotaped depositions. Much of Mr. Siri’s work — including the polio petition filed in 2022 — has been on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network, a nonprofit whose founder is a close ally of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Siri also represented Mr. Kennedy during his presidential campaign. Mr. Kennedy, President-elect Donald J. Trump’s choice for health secretary, has said that he does not want to take away access to any vaccines. But as he prepares for his confirmation hearing and plans a fresh health agenda, his continuing close partnership with Mr. Siri suggests that vaccine policy will be under sharp scrutiny. It is a chilling prospect to many public health leaders, especially those who recall the deadly toll of some vaccine-mitigated diseases. At the Trump transition headquarters in Florida, Mr. Siri has joined Mr. Kennedy in questioning and choosing candidates for top health positions, according to someone who observed the interactions but insisted on anonymity to disclose private conversations. They have asked candidates about their views of vaccines, the person said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Kennedy Jr. revisando candidatos para cargos de alto rango en el Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos. PorChristina JewettySheryl Gay Stolberg El abogado que ayuda a Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a elegir a los funcionarios federales de salud para el entrante gobierno de Trump ha solicitado al gobierno que revoque su aprobación de la vacuna contra la polio, que durante décadas ha protegido a millones de personas de un virus que puede causar parálisis o la muerte. Esa campaña es solo uno de los frentes de la guerra que el abogado Aaron Siri libracontra las vacunas de todo tipo. Siri también ha presentado una petición para que se suspenda la distribución de otras 13 vacunas; ha impugnado, y en algunos casos anulado, los mandatos de vacunación contra la COVID-19 en todo el país; ha demandado a organismos federales para que divulguen los registros relacionados con la aprobación de vacunas, y ha sometido a destacados científicos especializados en vacunas a duras declaraciones grabadas en vídeo. Gran parte del trabajo de Siri —incluida la petición contra la polio presentada en 2022— ha sido en nombre de la Red de Acción para el Consentimiento Informado, una organización sin ánimo de lucro cuyo fundador es un estrecho aliado de Kennedy. Siri también representó a Kennedy durante su campaña presidencial. Kennedy, la elección del presidente electo Donald Trump como secretario de Salud, ha dicho que no quiere eliminar el acceso a ninguna vacuna. Pero mientras se prepara para su audiencia de confirmación y planea una nueva agenda de salud, su continua y estrecha asociación con Siri sugiere que la política de vacunas estará bajo un agudo escrutinio.

"In a Growing Utah City, Residents Are Turning Against Their Mayor",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/us/mayor-vineyard-utah.html,"Residents voted to rein in a mayor who they say has a penchant for secrecy and is overly deferential to developers. Vineyard sits at the heart of one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation, and right next to Silicon Slopes, Utah’s booming tech center.Credit...Kim Raff for The New York Times Supported by ByLeia Larsen Photographs byKim Raff Leia Larsen is a reporter examining the intersection of Utah politics and environmental issues as part of The Times’sLocal Investigations Fellowship. Residents say Julie Fullmer was the type of mayor who would give out her cellphone number, responding to complaints at all hours about unplowed snow routes or broken sprinklers. She regularly encouraged residents, especially women, to run for City Council and volunteer on boards. Elected as a councilwoman in 2013 and as mayor four years later, she has helped guide Vineyard’s rapid growth from a farming town of 177 to a city of more than 14,000. She prides herself on a list of accomplishments, including the transformation of a shuttered steel mill into trails, townhomes, housing subdivisions and what developers hope might someday becomeUtah City— a downtown rivaling that of Salt Lake City. That venture was supposed to put Vineyard on the map. Instead, it has become the latest point of contention about the mayor’s leadership, according to interviews with nearly two dozen Vineyard officials and residents, as well as a review of campaign disclosures, emails, recordings of Council meetings and community posts online. Citizens have signed two petitions in recent years calling for Ms. Fullmer, 39, to resign. An adversary on the City Council has demanded scrutiny of her spending. And in elections last month, residents overwhelmingly voted to weaken the mayor’s powers. Showing a penchant for secrecy, she pledged $5 million in 2020 — without council members’ knowledge — for a controversial lake development project. She has largely self-funded her political campaigns, but residents are in the dark about the sources of her and her husband’s income (her role as mayor is only a part-time job). And recently, her ex-husband came forward to make startling claims about her past. The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

What Is Venture Capital Now Anyway?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/technology/andreessen-horowitz-benchmark-venture-capital.html,"ArtificialIntelligence The opposing paths taken by two powerful firms — Benchmark and Andreessen Horowitz — embody a profound debate about the future of an industry that funds and fosters American innovation. Credit...Jon Reinfurt Supported by ByErin Griffith Reporting from San Francisco Three decades ago, five men formed a venture capital firm on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley with a simple pitch: Small is beautiful. Their firm,Benchmark Capital, planned to stick to venture capital’s traditional playbook. It would write tiny checks to invest in private technology companies and help them succeed with guidance and connections. It would resist the urge to become bigger over time. Benchmark’s founders even quoted Voltaire: “God is not on the side of the big arsenals, but on the side of those who shoot best.” Fourteen years later, two entrepreneurs set up shop across the street with a very different plan. They establishedAndreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm that would do more of everything — raise more money, do more deals, make more noise and flash more attitude. Ben Horowitz, one of the firm’s founders, called his creation the “anti-Benchmark.” Since then, Andreessen Horowitz has expanded in every direction. It created funds focused on cryptocurrencies, defense and other tech, managing a total of $44 billion. It became a registered investment adviser, meaning it could own public stocks and cryptocurrencies. It hired 80 investment partners and opened five offices. It publishes eight newsletters and seven podcasts, and has more than 800 portfolio companies. It recently added private wealth management services. There are persistent rumors that it will go public. Benchmark, on the other hand, has hardly budged. It still has five partners who make investments. This year, it raised a new $425 million fund, which is roughly the same size its funds have been since 2004. Its website is a single landing page. The gap between the two firms — one clinging to venture capital’s traditional model and the other aggressively not — underscores the profound divergence in the industry that funds and fosters American innovation. As venture capital grew and Sand Hill Road took on the same mythological proportions as Wall Street, many top venture firms followed Andreessen Horowitz’s lead by supersizing. That propelled venture capital out of its longtime finance niche, turning it into a $1.2 trillion juggernaut last year, from $232 billion under management in 2009.

"YouTube TV Raises Monthly Charge 14 Percent, to $82.99",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/youtube-tv-price-increase.html,"Advertisement Supported by The increase is the latest for the streaming service, which debuted in 2017 at $35 a month. The company blamed “rising content costs.” ByEli Tan YouTube TV is becoming more expensive — again. YouTube announced on Thursday that the price of itsstreaming service had increased $10 a month, a 14 percent increase, to $82.99. For new subscribers, the change takes effect immediately, while existing subscribers will begin to pay the higher price on Jan. 13. In astatementposted on social media and emailed to YouTube TV subscribers, YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, cited “rising content costs” for the price change. “We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we realize this impacts our members,” the company said, adding that anyone who was paying a discounted rate or was on a trial would not be affected until that promotional period ended. The increase means YouTube TV is now charging the same as Hulu’s most popular television streaming package. Hulu, a rival cable substitute, raised that monthly streaming charge in October. It is the latest in a series of price hikes for YouTube TV, whichdebutedin 2017 at $35 a month and has slowly risen in price ever since, first to $50 a month in 2019 and most recently to $72.99 in March 2023. YouTube will not be adding new channels for subscribers as part of the increase. YouTube TV’s current offering of more than 100 traditional network and cable channels, a DVR service and six accounts per household will stay the same. YouTube declined to say how many subscribers YouTube TV had, but it reported in February that the service had eight million paying customers. Separate from YouTube, the company’s free video platform that generates revenue through advertisements, YouTube TV competes with Hulu, Fubo, Sling and other streaming services that offer a range of channels. Those cable substitutes compete for content as well as for customers, often at great cost. In 2022, YouTube TVacquired the exclusive rightsto a package of National Football League games called Sunday Ticket for $2 billion a year.

Stanley Recalls More Than 2 Million Travel Mugs Over Burn Hazard,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/stanley-recall-mugs.html,"Advertisement Supported by Stanley, which also makes trendy tumblers that are wildly popular on social media, urged consumers to contact them for replacement lids. ByAimee Ortiz After concerns that loose lids could lead to burn injuries, Stanley issued a recall of about 2.6 million travel mugs on Thursday, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said. The recall covers all Stanley Switchback and Trigger Action stainless steel travel mugs sold in the United States from June 2016 through this month,according to a statementby the safety commission. The defect that set off the recall concerned threads on the mugs’ polypropylene lids that “can shrink when exposed to heat and torque, causing the lid to detach during use, posing a burn hazard.” The mugs, which cost $20 and $50 depending on the model and were sold by Amazon, Walmart, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Target and other retailers nationwide and online, come in a variety of colors, including white, black and green. They range in size from 12 ounces to 20 ounces. Stanley has received reports of injuries stemming from the loose lids, according to the safety commission. Worldwide, there have been 91 reports detailing how the mugs’ lids detached during use, including 16 in the United States, for a total of 38 burn injuries. Stanley, a company based in Seattle,said in a statementthat it was “committed to constant improvement” and “focused on creating quality products that are built for life.” It urged consumers who own the affected products to stop using them andcontact itfor a free replacement lid. The popularity of Stanley products has exploded in recent years, with consumers evencamping out at Targetto get their hands on special-edition cups in specific colors. Stanley, which mostly sells bottle-adjacent products, has been around for more than a century and was the brainchild of the inventor William Stanley Jr. For most of its existence, the company targeted outdoorsy types. Led by influencers and content creators, the Stanley tumblers, which are different from the recalled travel mugs, have turned into trendy pop culture items, particularly on TikTok and Instagram. #StanleyTumbler has become a popular hashtag, used millions of times. The cup has been treated as a fashion accessory and a collector’s item by legions of fans. Sopan Debcontributed reporting.

Los Angeles Times Owner Wades Deeper Into Opinion Section,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/media/la-times-patrick-soon-shiong.html,"Advertisement Supported by Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong’s public comments and actions, including recently blocking an editorial weighing in on President-elect Trump’s cabinet picks, have concerned many staff members. ByKatie Robertson After President-elect Donald J. Trump announced a cascade of cabinet picks last month, the editorial board of The Los Angeles Times decided it would weigh in. One writer prepared an editorial arguing that the Senate should follow its traditional process for confirming nominees, particularly given the board’s concerns about some of his picks, and ignore Mr. Trump’s call for so-called recess appointments. The paper’s owner, the billionaire medical entrepreneur Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, had other ideas. Hours before the editorial was set to be sent to the printer for the next day’s newspaper, Dr. Soon-Shiong told the opinion department’s leaders that the editorial could not be published unless the paper also published an editorial with an opposing view. Baffled by his order and with the print deadline approaching, editors removed the editorial, headlined “Donald Trump’s cabinet choices are not normal. The Senate’s confirmation process should be.” It never ran. Dr. Soon-Shiong’s intervention, recounted by four people inside The Times who would speak only anonymously, is one of a string of events in which he has waded into the publication’s opinion section in ways that he hadn’t until this fall’s presidential campaign. Shortly before the presidential election, Dr. Soon-Shiong quashed the editorial board’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. Multiple staff members quit in protest. He has also said publicly that the outlet needs more balance and that he wants to introduce a“bias meter”alongside coverage. As the owner of The Times, Dr. Soon-Shiong can shape the publication as he wants. He has not recently weighed in on coverage in the newsroom, according to a top editor, which operates separately from the opinion section. Both departments are overseen by the same executive editor, Terry Tang. But Dr. Soon-Shiong’s public comments and actions have concerned many staff members who fear he is trying to be deferential to the incoming Trump administration. The call to have dueling editorials has also confounded many of its seasoned journalists, who know editorials as the institution’s position on issues.

F.T.C. Sues Largest U.S. Alcohol Distributor for Illegal Pricing,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/ftc-alcohol-lawsuit-illegal-pricing.html,"Advertisement Supported by The suit, under a long-dormant antitrust law, accuses Southern Glazer’s of charging small businesses “drastically” more than big chains. ByDanielle Kaye With just six weeks left in office, the Biden administration announced a new push, using an old law, to crack down on anticompetitive business practices. The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday sued Southern Glazer’s Wine and Spirits, accusing the largest alcohol distributor in the United States of unjustifiably charging higher prices to small businesses and limiting their ability to compete with big chains. Since at least 2018, Southern Glazer’s has offered steep discounts to large buyers like Kroger and Costco while imposing higher prices on neighborhood stores and independent shops that buy similar products, the F.T.C. said. The agency filed the antitrust lawsuit under a 1936 law that prohibits sellers from offering better prices to some buyers and not others, often at the expense of smaller businesses, without a justification based on differences in the cost of distribution. The law, called the Robinson-Patman Act, had not been enforced in more than two decades. The suit comes just days after a federal judgeruled in the F.T.C.’s favorin its effort to block Kroger’s proposed $25 billion acquisition of rival grocery chain Albertsons. It is consistent with the administration’s efforts to clamp down on what it sees as anticompetitive practices across industries, from technology to retail. “When local businesses get squeezed because of unfair pricing practices that favor large chains, Americans see fewer choices and pay higher prices — and communities suffer,” F.T.C. chair Lina Khan said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.

F.A.A. Administrator Will Resign Before Trump Takes Office,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/faa-administrator-resigns.html,"Advertisement Mike Whitaker, who runs the Federal Aviation Administration, is leaving the leadership position after serving only one year of a five-year term. ByMark Walker Reporting from Washington The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Whitaker, announced on Thursday that he is stepping down at the end of the President Biden’s term, leaving the agency without crucial leadership as ongoing safety challenges and questions about oversight of Boeing persist. Mr. Whitaker’s resignation comes just over a year into his five-year term that, if it had been fulfilled, would have spanned President-elect Donald J. Trump’s second administration. The length of the appointment is meant to provide stability and minimize political interference within the nation’s premier aviation safety agency. “This past year, air travel rebounded to near record highs but cancellations were at record lows — a testament to your excellence and dedication,” Mr. Whitaker wrote in a message to the agency’s employees. “It is not just me who recognizes what you do — the tens of the thousands of people who fly every day do, too.” Mr. Whitaker is stepping down just as the deputy administrator, Katie Thomson, is also departing, leaving an unexpected leadership void atop an agency that has struggled in recent years to find a leader willing to complete the five-year appointment. He is leaving as the safety regulator contends with a number of issues: the nation’s crumbling aviation infrastructure, the persistent problem of near collisions between commercial planes and manufacturing problems at Boeing. The storied plane maker’s 737 Max 8 jets were involved in two crashes during Mr. Trump’s first term, killing 346 people. And just months into Mr. Whitaker’s tenure, on Jan. 5, the door plug of an Alaska Airlines plane — a different 737 Max model — blew off in during a flight. The agency has increased the number of on-site inspectors in the company’s factories, along with slowing their production of commercial jets to allow closer scrutiny of their production.

Chanel Fills the Hottest Job in Fashion,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/style/chanel-new-designer-matthieu-blazy.html,"Advertisement Supported by Matthieu Blazy is getting the coveted post. Here’s how it went down. ByVanessa Friedman The hottest job in fashion has finally been filled. After six months without an artistic director, Chanel, the second largest luxury fashion brand in the world and the only couture house in the top three, has named a new designer:Matthieu Blazy. Most recently the man behind Bottega Veneta, Mr. Blazy will be in charge of all fashion, couture and accessories for Chanel, creating 10 collections a year. He will make his debut next October during the Paris shows. The appointment represents the biggest change in what has been the most disruptive year in fashion in decades, with seven other fashion houses naming new designers. Aside from Mr. Blazy, there will be debuts in 2025 at Celine, Givenchy, Lanvin, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, Alberta Ferretti, Dries Van Noten — and now, Bottega Veneta. Especially because it is clear that Mr. Blazy has been charged with sending Chanel, with its enormous reach and influence, in a new direction. “We have a lot of confidence in Matthieu’s capacity to bring modernity and a different approach to Chanel,” Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president for fashion, said during a video interview. “Matthieu has respect for the heritage but also a very specific design for ready-to-wear, for silhouettes, for bags, and we like it quite a lot. We want him to push, to test, to go where he feels is right. We don’t want to give the feeling that the brand is stuck.” Chanel needs to be “pertinent,” Mr. Pavlovsky said. And Mr. Blazy, he said, “is a talent for tomorrow. For sure, he is a talent today, but he’ll be bigger tomorrow.” Chanel, which reported revenues of almost$20 billionin 2023, is the rare luxury brand known for its clothing as well as its leather goods, fragrance and beauty lines, and is the only one of the top 10 fashion houses that remains in private hands. As such, it has powerful brand recognition and a semiology (camellias, pearls, bouclé, quilting, double C’s) that is practically synonymous with French chic. And without the need to offer quarterly public reports, it has the benefit of time to make change pay off — which makes the job as lead designer a luxury in itself.

Musk’s Foundation Gave Away Less Money Than Required in 2023,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/musk-foundation-taxes-donations.html,"Advertisement Supported by Private foundations must donate 5 percent of their assets every year. Elon Musk’s enormous charity missed that standard for three consecutive years. ByDavid A. FahrentholdandTheodore Schleifer Reporting from Washington For the third year in a row, Elon Musk’s charitable foundation did not give away enough of its money. And it did not miss the mark by a small amount. New tax filings show that the Musk Foundation fell $421 million short of the amount it was required to give away in 2023. Now, Mr. Musk has until the end of the year to distribute that money, or he will be required to pay a sizable penalty to the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Musk, in his newrole as a leaderof what President-elect Donald J. Trump is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, is promising to downsize and rearrange the entire federal government — including the I.R.S. But the tax records show he has struggled to meet a basic I.R.S. rule that is required of all charity leaders, no matter how small or big their foundations. Mr. Musk's is one of the biggest. His foundation has more than $9 billion in assets, including millions of shares in Tesla, his electric vehicle company. By law, all private foundations must give away 5 percent of those assets every year. The aim is to ensure that wealthy donors like Mr. Musk use these organizations to help the public instead of simply benefiting from the tax deductions they are afforded. Mr. Musk’s group has fallen further and further behind. In 2021, his foundation was $41 million short, then $234 million the following year. Now, the hole is deeper still. Private foundations do have a way to solve the problem if they do not give away enough money. They can distribute more the following year as a make-good. Mr. Musk could choose to do so in 2024.

How U.S. Firms Battled a Government Crackdown to Keep Tech Sales to China,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/tech-sales-china-huawei.html,"Advertisement Supported by An intense struggle has unfolded in Washington between companies and officials over where to draw the line on selling technology to China. ByAna Swanson Ana Swanson covers international trade and the U.S. technology restrictions against China. She reported from Washington and Sunnyvale, Calif. At a meeting in Washington this spring, tech company representatives and government officials once again found themselves at odds over where to draw the line when it came to selling coveted technology to China. The Biden administration was considering cutting off the sales of equipment used to manufacture semiconductors to three Chinese companies that the government had linked to Huawei, a technology giant that is sanctioned by the United States and is central to China’s efforts to develop advanced chips. Applied Materials, KLA Corporation and Lam Research, which make semiconductor equipment, argued that the three Chinese companies were a major source of revenue. The U.S. firms said that they had already earned $6 billion by selling equipment to those Chinese companies, and that they planned to sell billions more, two government officials said. U.S. officials, who view the flow of U.S. technology to Huawei as a national security threat, were stunned by the argument. In regulations issued this month, they ultimately rejected the American companies’ plea. Over the past year, an intense struggle has played out in Washington between companies that sell machinery to make semiconductors and Biden officials who are bent on slowing China’s technological progress. Officials argue that China’s ability to make chips that create artificial intelligence, guide autonomous drones and launch cyberattacks is a national security threat, and they have clamped down on U.S. technology exports, including innew ruleslast week. But many in the semiconductor industry have fought to limit the rules and preserve a critical source of revenue, more than a dozen current and former U.S. officials said.

A New Female Designer Takes Center Stage,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/style/bottega-veneta-matthieu-blazy-louise-trotter.html,"Advertisement Supported by Bottega Veneta announced that Louise Trotter will replace Matthieu Blazy as creative director. ByVanessa Friedman In the fashion equivalent of a nuclear chain reaction, Bottega Veneta announced on Thursday thatMatthieu Blazy, its designer of three years and the man who made it into a must-see brand in Milan, was leaving the house. He is expected to become the new designer of Chanel. Replacing Mr. Blazy at Bottega Veneta will be Louise Trotter, currently the designer of the French brand Carven, which has yet to name her replacement. Ms. Trotter, who will take up her post at Bottega Veneta at the end of January 2025, will become theonly female creative directoramong the stable of designers at Kering, the group that owns Bottega Veneta as well as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga. Ms. Trotter comes to Bottega after spending just shy of two years at Carven, a house she rescued from irrelevance and reinvented as a minimalist’s haven of accessible but plush luxury. Her taste “seamlessly combines exquisite design with sublime craft, and her commitment to cultural advocacy aligns beautifully with our brand vision,” said Leo Rongone, the chief executive of Bottega Veneta, in a news release. Ms. Trotter, 55, will inherit a house that Mr. Blazy helped transform into the brightest spot in Kering’s portfolio. For thethird quarter of this year, Bottega’s revenues were just under 400 million euros ($416.6 million), an increase of 4 percent, at a time when Gucci’s revenues dropped 25 percent and Saint Laurent’s 13 percent. During his tenure at Bottega, Mr. Blazy, 40, introduced fine jewelry and a genderless perfume. He was nominated as designer of the year for the 2022 and 2023 Fashion Awards in London. Celebrity fans included Jacob Elordi, Michelle Yeoh, ASAP Rocky, Julianne Moore and Jennifer Lawrence, who recently wore a Bottega dress to show off her pregnancy at the Governors Awards in Los Angeles. A Brit, Ms. Trotter brings years of experience to Bottega, with previous creative director stints at Lacoste and the English label Joseph. At a time when fashion, and especially fashion shows, are increasingly treated as a subset of the entertainment world, Ms. Trotter, like Mr. Blazy, is a quiet but decisive (and dryly humorous) presence, known for a more personal, product-first approach to her job and a sense of materiality and understanding of silhouette. She is, however, less playfully experimental than her predecessor and possessed of an aesthetic that might be termed gracefully grown up. (Her work tends to be mentioned in the same breath asPhoebe Philo’s Celine, and the Row.) She should be a reassuring presence at Bottega, despite the fact that she will be its third creative director in five years and despite the current upheaval in the fashion world, with eight different brands naming new designers in the last year. To that point, Ms. Trotter said she was honored to join Bottega Veneta and “celebrate its timeless vision.” She will make her debut in October 2025 during Milan Fashion Week. Vanessa Friedman has been the fashion director and chief fashion critic for The Times since 2014.More about Vanessa Friedman Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Symbol of India’s Global Soft Power Stumbles After U.S. Indictments,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/adani-group-indictment-modi.html,"Advertisement Supported by Countries in Asia, Africa and elsewhere have been distancing themselves from Gautam Adani, the Indian magnate, after accusations of bribery and conspiracy by American prosecutors. ByAlex TravelliandAbdi Latif Dahir Alex Travelli reported from New Delhi and Abdi Latif Dahir from Nairobi. Hours after U.S. officials indicted Gautam Adani, one of India’s most successful businessmen, on fraud and conspiracy charges, Kenya’s president publicly backed away from lucrative infrastructure deals with Mr. Adani’s companies to overhaul Nairobi’s international airport and the country’s electricity grid. Days later, TotalEnergies, a European energy giant, said it would stop investing in Adani projects. Now Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, whereIndia competes with China for influence, are rethinking their alliances with Mr. Adani. For the past decade, the Adani Group has been the face of India-led development around the world. In India, it owns ports, power plants, mines, airports and even a TV station. The conglomerate is one of the country’s most valuable enterprises. Its ability to build, finance and operate highly visible infrastructure projects has made Adani an icon of corporate India as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to expand its place on the global stage. In the process, Mr. Adani became one of the richest people in the world. His brand spread, as few Indian companies have ever managed, to encompass deals in Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa and the Middle East. That is all now at risk of unraveling. On Nov. 20, federal prosecutors in New York’s Eastern District accused Mr. Adani of conspiracy to commit bribery and defraud investors, part of a sweeping indictment that took aim at several of his close lieutenants and family members. The prosecutors said that Mr. Adani and his associates offered $265 million to Indian officials to secure solar project contracts, then lied about the bribery scheme to Wall Street. The Adani Group said the charges were “baseless” and that it would defend itself legally. The shock waves from the indictment are still bouncing between India’s stock markets, foreign investors and the governments of countries that do business with the Adani Group. The group’s relations with international partners are under increasing strain. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Ev Williams Was Lonely. He Doesn’t Want You to Be.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/technology/ev-williams-twitter-medium-mozi.html,"The serial internet entrepreneur, who co-founded Twitter and created Medium, was turning 50 and feeling detached from friends. Maybe a new start-up could fix that. Evan Williams’s new app, Mozi, is aimed at fostering in-real-life connections.Credit...Carolyn Fong for The New York Times Supported by ByErin Griffith Reporting from Menlo Park, Calif. Evan Williamsdid not want to start another start-up. He had already enjoyed the kind of rare, unfathomable success most entrepreneurs only dream of, starting tech companies that made products used by millions — the early blogging site Blogger, the social media giant Twitter, the publishing platform Medium. Along the way, Mr. Williams had grappled with corporate turmoil and angst. His last company, Medium, was a decade-long slog that never lived up to its $600 million valuation orlofty missionof solving the internet’s ugliest problems. By the time hestepped down as chief executivein 2022, he had no desire to do it again, he said. But he was lonely. He had gotten divorced and moved cross-country twice in a few years. Before his 50th birthday in 2022, he realized he had “underinvested” in his friendships, he said. Post-pandemic, he did not even know where many of his friends were living. “I was doing a lot of reflecting,” Mr. Williams said. “In this stage of life, I really wanted to focus on relationships.” Pouring so much energy into his start-ups was one reason he had this problem. But maybe a start-up could also help fix it. In 2022, Mr. Williams began working on a Rolodex app that would tell him where his friends were living and traveling. It would be more “social” than “social media,” with none of the comments, stories, posts, likes, hearts or follows that made his previous creations so addicting.

BuzzFeed Strikes Deal to Sell ‘Hot Ones’ Company for $82.5 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/buzzfeed-hot-ones-sale.html,"Advertisement Supported by The sale, to a group that includes the show’s host, Sean Evans, and Soros Fund Management, will allow BuzzFeed to pay down tens of millions of dollars in debt. ByBenjamin Mullin BuzzFeed on Thursday said it had reached a deal to sell the company behind the popular interview show “Hot Ones” for $82.5 million, easing a cash crunch that has loomed over the media company for months. The buyer is a consortium of investors led by an affiliate of Soros Fund Management that also includes Sean Evans, the affable host of “Hot Ones,” and Chris Schonberger, the founder of First We Feast, the show’s parent company. Mythical Entertainment, the media company created by the YouTube stars Rhett and Link, is also an investor. The deal will allow BuzzFeed to pay down tens of millions of dollars in debt that was scheduled to come due this month. The company is reducing its debt load of nearly $124 million by $88.8 million, using proceeds from the sale and funding from its operations, leaving the company with more cash than debt on its books. The deal is also a new chapter for the company behind “Hot Ones,” a show in which Mr. Evans stoically interviews celebrities while they eat progressively hotter chicken wings. Scarlett Johansson, Megan Thee Stallion, Sydney Sweeney, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele have all appeared as guests. Campaign officials for Vice President Kamala Harriswanted her to go on the show, but First We Feast demurred, saying that “Hot Ones” didn’t want to delve into politics, an adviser to Ms. Harris, Stephanie Cutter, said during an interview last month. The sale unwinds the vestiges of a deal, struck three years ago, to acquire Complex, a rival company that owned First We Feast and is known for its coverage of pop culture. The deal helped BuzzFeed go public, but the company’s stock has since fallen, as investors grew increasingly bearish on digital media. BuzzFeed has since pared back its investment in expensive original content, telling investors that it is focusing on using technology such as artificial intelligence to create and deliver content to users. The company shuttered its news division in 2023, and this year, itsoldComplex for $108.6 million, though it held onto First We Feast. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

European Central Bank Cuts Interest Rates as the Economy Weakens,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/european-central-bank-interest-rates.html,"Advertisement Supported by The bank has been lowering rates since June as inflation slowed, but other risks are growing, including the threat of higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald J. Trump. ByEshe Nelson Reporting from London The European Central Bank lowered interest rates on Thursday, the fourth cut this year amid growing concerns that the region’s economic outlook is darkening. Policymakers reduced the bank’s deposit rate by a quarter point, to 3 percent, in a move widely expected by investors. The bank, which sets rates for the 20 countries that use the euro, has been lowering rates since June as inflation slowed toward its target of 2 percent. In November, inflation averaged 2.3 percent across the region, slightly higher than in previous months as energy prices rose. The bank forecast inflation will average 2.1 percent next year. There is “not yet the victory against inflation, not yet mission accomplished,” Christine Lagarde, the president of the central bank, said on Thursday at a news conference in Frankfurt. But at their final policy meeting for the year, officials acknowledged that “inflation was really on track” to meet their 2 percent target, she added. Policymakers did discuss whether a larger half-point cut was warranted, but they all ultimately agreed to the quarter-point reduction, Ms. Lagarde said. Substantial progress has been made reining in inflation in recent years after it peaked above 10 percent in late 2022, but other risks are accumulating.Europe faces the prospect of higher tariffson its goods exported to the United States imposed during the second term of President-elect Donald J.

"Remembering David Bonderman, a Private Equity Pioneer",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/dealbook/david-bonderman-tpg-dead.html,"Advertisement Newsletter A former lawyer, he cofounded the giant investment firm TPG and became known for complex deals that remade corporate America. He died on Wednesday at 82. ByAndrew Ross SorkinRavi MattuBernhard WarnerSarah KesslerMichael J. de la MercedandLauren Hirsch David Bonderman, a corporate lawyer who co-founded the giant investment firm TPG and helped transform private equity into a multitrillion-dollar industry that reshaped Wall Street, died on Wednesday morning. He was 82. Bonderman — Bondo to his friends — became a private equity pioneer, leading big and complex takeovers that saw corporate titans go public, and whose success helped persuade publicly traded companies to adopt his industry’s tactics, DealBook’s Michael de la Merced writes. Bonderman’s entry into private equity was by happenstance.After graduating from Harvard Law School, he taught law and then worked as a civil rights lawyer for the Justice Department. He went on to join the Washington law firm Arnold & Porter. Among his achievements there was persuading the Supreme Court to overturn an insider-trading conviction of Raymond Dirks, a securities analyst turned whistle-blower. In the mid-1980s, Bonderman was approached by Robert Bass, the Texas oil magnate, about helping run his family office. Bonderman said that he had never invested professionally before, but Bass told him that he hadn’t either. Bonderman and a colleague in the family office, Jim Coulter, founded what became TPG in 1993. By then, the two had made their names by buying Continental out of bankruptcy and turning around the embattled airline. (Emblematic of their approach: They FedExed undesirable food from the plane to Continental’s C.E.O., telling him it needed improving.) They joined a small group of financiers who turned leveraged buyouts from a cottage industry into a Wall Street behemoth, borrowing money to buy, restructure and flip big businesses.

China Pledges More Stimulus to Shore Up Flagging Economy,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/china-economy-2025-priorities.html,"China’sEconomy Advertisement Supported by At a meeting to set the party’s economic policy agenda, China’s leadership said it would borrow more and cut interest rates in a bid to bolster growth. ByMeaghan TobinandJohn Liu Meaghan Tobin reported from Taipei, and John Liu from Seoul. China’s top leaders on Thursday pledged more stimulus measures to shore up the country’s economy, building on steps they have taken in recent months to bolster growth. At an annual gathering of the Chinese Communist Party and the cabinet, led by the country’s top leader, Xi Jinping, officials agreed that the government should allow a bigger budget deficit, borrow more and cut interest rates, the state television broadcaster said on Thursday. The statements suggest a willingness by Beijing to take more aggressive steps to increase spending, part of a shift that began in September to turn around years of weak consumer demand, lackluster growth and declining prices. China “will need to maintain economic growth and maintain overall stability of employment and prices next year,” the state broadcaster said at the conclusion of the two-day Central Economic Work Conference, which sets the economic agenda for the upcoming year. The Chinese government typically uses the conference to signal priorities that could translate into policy action in the next year, and to agree on budget details that will be announced at the spring legislative session. Earlier this week, the ruling Politburo gave a rare public acknowledgment that Beijing needed to take a stronger approach on the economy, when it indicated it would be more willing tolower interest rates. It was the first time that China’s leaders had eased their stance on monetary policy since the aftermath of the global financial crisis 14 years ago.

New Federal Rule Limits Overdraft Fees at Large Banks,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/bank-overdraft-fees-limits.html,"Advertisement Supported by It is unclear whether the rule, which could help save Americans billions in fees each year, will remain in place after President-elect Donald J. Trump returns to office. ByMadeleine Ngo Reporting from Washington The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule on Thursday that would limit overdraft charges at large banks and credit unions, a move that federal officials said could help save Americans billions in fees each year. Whether it will remain in place once President-elect Donald J. Trump returns to power is unclear. The rule would cap fees that customers are charged when they spend more money than they have in their bank accounts. Federal officials said large banks would have several options to comply. They could cap their overdraft fees at $5, or set their fees at another amount that covers their costs and losses. Alternatively, they could treat overdrafts as a line of credit and provide similar disclosures, including applicable interest rates. While many banks have moved to reduce their overdraft fees, charges still average around $30 for each instance, according to a recentBankrate survey. The rule would apply to institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, which includes about 150 of the nation’s roughly 9,000 banks and credit unions, and take effect in October. Banking trade groups sharply criticized the rule after the bureauproposed it this year. Some in the industry are expecting the Trump administration, which took a friendly approach to banks during Mr. Trump’s first term, to try to roll it back. Republican lawmakers could also try to undo it and other Biden administration regulations using an obscure law known as theCongressional Review Act. But given slim Republican majorities in the House and the Senate next year, it is unclear whether they could muster enough support to roll back many rules.

Help Yourself! How Readers Fought the Travel Industry and Won.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/travel/travel-refunds-resolutions.html,"Advertisement Supported by Tripped Up You don’t always need professional help to make things right after a travel snafu. Here are four ways readers got refunds and resolutions on their own. BySeth Kugel Who needs you? After we first connected, you said you’d take on my problem. But while you dawdled working on other travelers’ issues, I got my money back from that dastardly airline/travel site/car rental agency on my own.Sam Q. Traveler, Everywhere Sam is right. If you are wowed by my knack for getting answers and squeezing refunds out of airlines, hotels and other travel providers, temper your reaction slightly. It’s the “nytimes.com” part of my email address that does most of the work, an incantation that bypasses the exasperating mess of online bots, interactive phone menus (“Representative!!!!”) and frontline customer-service agents. Instead, I’m connected with a usually attentive media relations department. What’s more impressive, really, is the number of readers who manage to resolve big travel frustrations without a big name or an influential email address. Roughly a third of readers I initially offer to help no longer need me by the time their issue gets to the front of the line. So for my final column of 2024, I will share four strategies from do-it-yourselfers who found successful ways to get their cases in front of a sympathetic eyes and ears and receive recourse. A modest request to the incoming Trump administration: Please retain the U.S. Transportation Department’s surprisingly simpleair travel service complaint form— and the federal workers who read the submissions — as the resource helped many readers this year, including Asa of Minneapolis. Asa and his family traveled to Europe for a ski vacation in February, flying Delta and KLM, but their luggage was delayed. Without winter clothes and ski equipment, the family, Asa said, bought only the basics and rented what they could, but in the pricey ski town of Andermatt, Switzerland, they still spent $5,200. The family meticulously saved itemized receipts and submitted them to KLM. (The airline that flies the final leg is the point of contact for lost luggage, according to theMontreal Convention, an international treaty governing lost luggage on most international flights.)

"In Milei’s Argentina, Economic Albatross Is Tamed but Life Is Much Harder",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/argentina-president-milei-inflation-economy.html,"Global Economy Advertisement Supported by A year after becoming president, Javier Milei has been praised inside and outside Argentina for reining in galloping inflation. But his economic policies have inflicted widespread hardship. ByDaniel PolitiLucía Cholakian HerreraandAna Ionova Daniel Politi and Lucía Cholakian Herrera reported from Buenos Aires, and Ana Ionova from Rio de Janeiro. At home and abroad, Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, is a man with plenty of fans. And not just any fans. Mr. Milei, a right-wing libertarian, may not have been an obvious choice as the first world leader to meet President-elect Donald J. Trump after his election victory. Yet there he was, at Mar-a-Lago in Florida last month, being showered with praise by Mr. Trump. “The job you’ve done is incredible,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Milei at a gala for a right-wing research institute. “You’ve done a fantastic job in a very short period of time.” Many Argentines seem to agree. A year after taking office, Mr. Milei is viewed favorably by about 56 percent of Argentines, according to a recentpoll, making him one of the most popular presidents in the country’s recent history. “This is the president that God brought for the Argentines,” said Marcelo Capobianco, 54, a butcher in Buenos Aires. “He brought back hope.” While a cascade of brutal cuts to everything from soup kitchens to bus fare subsidies have pushed more than five million Argentines into poverty, they have also helped Mr. Milei make remarkable progress on a daunting task: reining in the world’s highest inflation rate.

The C.E.O.s Are Tripping. Can Psychedelics Help the C-Suite?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/psychedelic-retreats-ceos.html,"Advertisement Supported by A growing cottage industry is dedicated to the theory that mind-altering drugs can improve business leadership. ByEmma Goldberg Burrowed in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies is a wooden house, a retreat center made of pine and spruce and filled with mushroom carvings, tapestries of periwinkle and indigo paisley, books about “The Indoctrinated Brain” and other paraphernalia nodding to the promised transformation: Enter as a chief executive, emerge as an enlightened one. When a group of executives wearing hoodies and leggings arrived on a Tuesday evening in October, they vibrated with the nervous energy of summer camp drop-off. They were gathered for a retreat called “The Psychedelic C.E.O.,” which they had agreed to let me observe. Their guide, Murray Rodgers, used to be a hard-charging oil and gas executive. About a decade ago, he underwent a process of self-discovery. It began after a miserable pairing — a divorce and a failed company initial public offering — that left him alone on his 60th birthday, watching Hugh Grant’s romantic comedy “The Rewrite” and wondering if it was time for a rewrite of his own. He became a yoga instructor and then went to Costa Rica to try ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic brew. This started a sequence of mushroom trips and psychedelic ceremonies that left Mr. Rodgers, now 69, spiritually, psychologically and professionally transfigured. It was as if he had thrown his ego into a dryer and watched it shrink, and he became intent on helping others with that same kind of cosmic laundering. He wrote a book, “The Psychedelic C.E.O.,” and after hearing from readers, he also began hosting retreats. On that day in October, he welcomed five business leaders — Adam, Adam, Jill, Chris and Ajay — most of whom requested to use only their first names so as not to alarm their investors, employees or children with their unconventional approach to professional development. All run small businesses in the Calgary area and had met through an entrepreneurs’ network. After their arrival, they scarfed down bowls of thick lentil soup and then settled on couches in a downstairs den, waiting for Mr. Rodgers to introduce the agenda. I'm 50 years old and I have used and loved psychedelic drugs since I was 14 and I have to say that, based on my hundreds of experiences and those of many people who I have spoken to about their own experiences, I think using psychedelics will more likely result in a CEO quitting their job rather than becoming ""better"" at it.I have yet to meet anyone who uses psychedelics and still believes in and supports unfettered capitalism. I have also seen comments suggesting that a hike in nature is equivalent or even better than the psychedelic experience. I respectfully disagree. Although some people should never take psychedelic drugs due to mental health issues or cultural/religious/other factors, what psychedelics do to the human mind is completely unique. Some of my best experiences have been taking psychedelics while in nature, and although I love hiking in nature and I am fortunate enough to be able to do so every single day all year, my experiences while sober simply so not come close to my experiences while on psychedelics.Please know that I am not advising or advocating for minors to use psychedelic drugs while underage, and I am aware that my brain was affected and shaped by my early drug use. I firmly believe that it was right for me because it brought me out of a depression so deep that I no longer wanted to remain in the world, and I am grateful that I was able to use psychedelics to treat my mental condition, but I'm not suggesting others follow my example. @Lisa Coston This was interesting, thank you for sharing. This was a sentiment I saw shared on social media as I was reporting the piece — that some people believe doing psychedelics will cause CEOs to no longer want to be CEOs. For the people I spoke with, it was certainly a useful way to rethink ego and ambition. Smoking Marijuana and using LSD are completely different. I used marijuana in college and enjoyed its effects. My first LSD trip was frightening and over whelming. I felt like the ceiling was falling down. I cried the entire time and was scared to death. I thought it would never end. But I tried it two more times. It was terrible experiences. It did not expand my mind in any way. It did not expand my brain function. It made me manic and scared. @Susan Thanks for your comment Susan. I spoke with a number of psychiatrists about the potential risks. They emphasized that especially people with loaded family histories of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder should exercise caution about psychedelics, because they could experience psychosis. These psychiatrists also emphasized that some people experience ""bad trips"" (including anxiety, panic) Oh look! Another thing CEOs can do that other people cannot: use illegal drugs with impunity.

PorEmma Goldberg Enterrada en las faldas de las Montañas Rocosas canadienses se encuentra una casa de madera, un centro de retiro hecho de pino y pícea y lleno de tallas de hongos, tapices de cachemira color bígaro e índigo, libros sobre “el cerebro adoctrinado” y demás parafernalia que hace guiños a la transformación prometida: entrar como un director ejecutivo, emerger como uno iluminado. Cuando un grupo de ejecutivos con sudaderas con capucha y mallas llegó un martes de octubre por la tarde, vibraba con la energía nerviosa del primer día de un campamento de verano. Estaban reunidos para un retiro llamado “El CEO psicodélico”, el cual me habían permitido observar. Su guía, Murray Rodgers, solía ser un duro ejecutivo del sector del petróleo y el gas. Hace aproximadamente una década, tuvo un proceso de autodescubrimiento. Empezó tras un par de eventos desgraciados —un divorcio y el fracaso de la oferta pública inicial de una empresa— que lo dejaron solo el día de su cumpleaños 60, viendo la comedia romántica de Hugh Grant,Escribiendo de amor,y preguntándose si había llegado el momento de reescribir su propia historia. Se hizo profesor de yoga y viajó a Costa Rica para probar la ayahuasca, una infusión alucinógena. Rodgers, que ahora tiene 69 años, inició así una serie de viajes con hongos y ceremonias psicodélicas que lo transfiguraron de forma espiritual, psicológica y profesional. Fue como si hubiera metido su ego en una secadora y lo hubiera visto encogerse, y se propuso ayudar a otros con ese mismo tipo de lavado cósmico. Escribió un libro,The Psychedelic CEO, y tras recibir comentarios de los lectores, empezó también a organizar retiros. Aquel día de octubre dio la bienvenida a cinco líderes empresariales —Adam, Adam, Jill, Chris y Ajay—, la mayoría de los cuales pidieron usar solo sus nombres de pila para no alarmar a sus inversores, empleados o hijos con su enfoque poco convencional del desarrollo profesional. Todos dirigen pequeñas empresas en la zona de Calgary y se habían conocido a través de una red de empresarios. A su llegada, se zamparon una sopa de lentejas espesa y se acomodaron en los sofás del estudio de la planta baja, a la espera de que Rodgers presentara el plan del día.

Ready for the Next Extreme-Weather Catastrophe? Here’s How to Pack a ‘Go Bag.’,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/go-bag-extreme-weather.html,"Advertisement Supported by If the trend continues, extreme weather will occur more frequently. Here’s how experts suggest you prepare. ByShannon Sims Extreme weather is happening more frequently across the country, as we have seen this year with Hurricane Helene’s catastrophic impact onAsheville, N.C., November’swildfiresin New York and New Jersey and this month’s fast-spreadingMalibu fire. Nearly 20 percent of all Americans have had to evacuate their homes because of unexpected severe weather, according to anew studyby the analytics firm YouGov. More and more people are looking for a way to protect themselves from the next hurricane, tornado, flash flood or fire. Fortunately, there’s an affordable and easy way to be better prepared: by packing an extreme-weather go bag. An extreme-weather go bag is an emergency kit you can keep in your home or car — some people make one for each — that’s filled with items that can quickly become invaluable during a crisis, or if you have to evacuate. A properly packed go bag will have the essentials for at least 72 hours, as recommended by theFederal Emergency Management Agency. It will eliminate the panic of wondering what to bring with you, and it may end up saving your life. “If you don’t take the time to address these questions before a disaster strikes, you’ll be hard pressed to do so in the rush of a potential crisis,” said Stephanie Fox, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross. So what should go into your 72-hour extreme-weather go bag? We’ve compiled a list of some of the essentials. To make our list, we looked at the emergency kit lists published byFEMA, theAmerican Red Crossandlocalagencies. We also checked out specific product recommendations cheered by Reddit users or published by Wirecutter, a product review website owned by The New York Times Company, which publishesemergency preparedness guidesbroken down by the type of disaster, whether a hurricane, fire or earthquake. After culling through all of those resources, we narrowed down our go-bag contents to the most essential items that are also affordable (most of our suggestions cost less than $25). Our basic emergency kit includes durable products that can sit in the corner of a closet, or in the trunk of a car, for years. (Although experts recommend reviewing emergency go bags at least once a year to make sure everything is charged, working and not expired.) We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Una bolsa de emergencia bien preparada tendrá lo esencial para al menos 72 horas, como recomienda laAgencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias(FEMA, por su sigla en inglés). Eliminará el pánico de preguntarte qué llevar contigo, y puede acabar salvándote la vida. “Si no te tomas el tiempo necesario para abordar estas cuestiones antes de que se produzca una catástrofe, difícilmente podrás hacerlo en las prisas de una posible crisis”, dijo Stephanie Fox, portavoz de la Cruz Roja Americana. ¿Qué debes incluir en tu bolsa de 72 horas para situaciones meteorológicas extremas?

"Why Was a Murder Suspect’s Instagram Taken Down, but Not His Goodreads?",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/technology/social-media-goodreads-reddit-tiktok.html,"UnitedHealthcareC.E.O. Shooting Advertisement Supported by Luigi Mangione’s social media accounts attracted swift attention after he was arrested in the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive. When do companies scrub a digital trail? ByAmanda Holpuch Moments after the authorities announced that Luigi Mangione had been arrested in the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive on Monday, people delved intohis digital trail. Strangers commented on what appeared to be Mr. Mangione’s old Instagram photos from Hawaii and read his reviews of the “Hunger Games” series on Goodreads. Within hours, many of his social media accounts had been scrubbed and were no longer accessible to the public. Others remained active. Here’s how different social media companies decide whether to scrub a user’s digital footprint. When someone goes from having a private life to getting public attention, online accounts they intended for a small circle of friends or acquaintances are scrutinized by curious strangers — and journalists. (Here aresome tipsfor increasing your online privacy.) In some cases, these newly public figures or their loved ones can shut down the accounts or make them private. Others, like Mr. Mangione, who has beencharged with murder, are cut off from their devices, leaving their digital lives open for the public’s consumption. Either way, tech companies have discretion in what happens to the account and its content. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects companies from legal liability for posts made by users. “Companies generally have a lot of freedom to decide what content to allow and what content to remove,” said Jolynn Dellinger, a senior lecturing fellow at Duke Law. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has a“dangerous organizations and individuals” policythat prohibits organizations and individuals from using its platforms if they “proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence.” That determination is made on the basis of a user’s online and offline behavior, the policy says.

New York Times and Tech Guild Reach Deal,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/media/new-york-times-tech-guild-deal.html,"Advertisement Supported by The union, which represents some 600 tech workers at the publication, had been negotiating for a contract for more than two years. It will vote on ratifying the deal next week. ByKatie Robertson The Times Tech Guild, which represents tech workers at The New York Times, said on Wednesday that it had reached a tentative deal with The Times on a contract, after more than two years of bargaining and a weeklong strike. In an announcement, the guild said the three-year contract included provisions such as wage increases of up to 8.25 percent over the length of the contract; “just cause” protections that mean workers cannot be fired without a good reason; additional compensation for on-call work; and flexible hybrid work schedules. Union members will vote on the ratification of the contract on Dec. 19. If approved, it will be the first contract for the Times Tech Guild, which was certified in a National Labor Relations Boardelectionin March 2022 and is the country’s largest union of tech workers with collective bargaining rights. The guild, which has more than 600 members, represents workers like data analysts, software developers and product managers. “These first contract wins set a strong foundation for job protections that our colleagues will build upon for generations,” Kathy Zhang, a senior analytics manager and the unit chair of the Tech Guild, said in a statement. A spokeswoman for the company said: “We’re pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with the Tech Guild.” The contract negotiations were at times contentious. Guild memberswent on strikeover the busy Election Day news period in November, protesting daily outside The Times’s Manhattan offices. The unionendedits strike after a week and without a contract.

Building Trust in an Age of Distrust,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/dealbook/summit-elected-officials-leaders.html,"DealBookSummit News Analysis At this year’s DealBook Summit, there was a sense that trust was becoming harder to come by and that the rules for how people judge the truth had shifted. Credit...Photo illustration by KLAWE RZECZY; Photographs by Amir Hamja (Bezos), Calla Kessler (Griffin) and Pete Marovich (Powell) for The New York Times; Getty Images; Associated Press (Clinton, Pichai); and EPA (Cooper, Williams) Supported by ByAndrew Ross Sorkin This article is part of our special section on theDealBook Summitthat included business and policy leaders from around the world. Toward the end of my more than hourlong interview last week with Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and space entrepreneur, there was a comment that struck me — that’s been rattling around in my brain for days. “I gave up on being well understood a long time ago,” Mr. Bezos said. “To be understood is too difficult.” He added: “It’s hard enough, by the way, to be well understood by your loved ones, by your kids and your closest friends. It takes a lot of energy. If you think you understand any public figure, you probably don’t.” It was a profound thought because so much of what the public does on any given day is try to take the measure of our world’s public figures — and the institutions they run. We judge them. We are constantly assessing them — online and off. We try to determine whether we like them, whether we trust them and whether they deserve our hard-earned dollars. This is particularly true of elected officials, but it is increasingly true of the leaders of our nation who are unelected — who run the companies that touch our lives in various ways. We read about the rankings of the Forbes and Fortune magazine lists, and we look at their philanthropic efforts as a sign of both their success and, perhaps, their humanity. All of this is being processed through human sensibilities that are both imperfect and increasingly polarized by politics and a bubble of social media feeds.

In an increasingly unpredictable world, a leader’s role is to serve as a shock absorber. At best, volatility distracts teams, and at worst, it scares them. The best leaders not only prepare teams for sudden swings in the business and geopolitical landscape but also help them maintain focus on their mission and the work at hand. At Warby Parker, we have a clear objective to provide vision for all — and we can adapt more quickly when we stay focused on that goal. While volatility can foster self-doubt and lead to task switching, a thoughtful and stable strategy still wins in the long run. Groundbreaker Topic: Repairing the Torn Fabric of Our Communities With Compassion What is one act we can do as citizens or community members to bridge that which seems to divide our communities?

Serena Williams Is Competing on a New Court: Investment,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/dealbook/serena-williams-investment.html,"DealBookSummit Advertisement Supported by “I’ve learned to trust my instincts in any business venture or brand I’m championing,” the retired tennis star said in an interview at the DealBook Summit. ByShivani Vora This article is part of our special section on theDealBook Summitthat included business and policy leaders from around the world. Serena Williams may have retired in 2022 from a record breaking career in professional tennis that catapulted her to global fame, but her post-tournament life keeps her just as professionally engaged, albeit in a different realm. Ms. Williams, 43, is the founder of Serena Ventures, a venture capital fund that invests in early stage companies, primarily ones founded by women and minorities. Established in 2017, when Ms. Williams was at the peak of her career, the firmraised $111million for its inaugural fund and has invested in more than 60 brands. Serena Ventures comprises a team of seven, including Ms. Williams, and supports companies that positively impact “the everyday lives of everyday people,” she said. They include Parfait, a Black-owned brand that relies on A.I. and facial recognition to create custom wigs and hair extensions, and Halp, a company that helps students navigate the process of studying abroad and make it more affordable. Serena Ventures also has a hand in the media and entertainment brand Boss Beauty, and Wile, a line of plant-based supplements for women over 40. Beyond her venture fund, Ms. Williams’ professional pursuits encompass Wyn Beauty by Serena Williams, a line of makeup with products made with vegan ingredients and minimal chemicals. She also has stakes in sports teams, including, she said, the Miami Dolphins. In her conversation on the main stage at the DealBook Summit 2024 with the event’s founder, Andrew Ross Sorkin, Ms. Williams touched on her competitive nature and her relationships with her family. She said that while her father, Richard Williams, might be perceived as tough, her mother, Oracene Price, was “way tougher.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"For Athletes, the Draw and the How of Branding",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/dealbook/athletes-brands-careers.html,"DealBookSummit Advertisement Supported by A task force at the DealBook Summit discussed how from college to pro sports, becoming a brand is a challenge. ByPaul Sullivan This article is part of our special section on theDealBook Summitthat included business and policy leaders from around the world. If you’re Michael Jordan, the basketball superstar, you can be silent and still be a brand. But every other athlete needs to figure out how to position themselves if they want to move from great player to top recipient of sponsorship dollars and to one day being their own brand. The “how” is the most challenging part, agreed a group of athletes and sports personalities convened on Dec. 4 as part of The New York Times DealBook Summit panel, “The Other Game: How Athletes Become Brands.” “It’s starting younger and younger,” said Bomani Jones, host of the podcast “The Right Time With Bomani Jones.” “The safe play is what people think is the Michael Jordan play, which is to not really say anything interesting. That only worked because Michael Jordan is the coolest dude in the world.” For everyone else — from college athletes reaping the benefits of name, image and likeness (known as N.I.L.) deals to elite athletes in their prime and beyond — the consensus was that becoming a brand is hard and may not be the best career move for many athletes, if it’s even achievable. For starters, building a brand is different than playing the sport that got someone to the point where that is even an option. Sports grounds you. Brand-building forces you into the public in a way that may be beyond your comfort zone. It’s almost as if you can’t be too public. Jess Sims, the moderator, who built her personal brand as an early Peloton instructor and is now a host for The Athletic, framed branding challenges as aspirational versus inspirational. In the past, someone might buy a poster of Kobe Bryant and put it on their wall. Now they want to watch the behind-the-scenes footage of that poster shoot to glean tips on how they might one day get there themselves. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Seismic Political Shifts Are Likely to Continue,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/dealbook/election-task-force.html,"DealBookSummit Advertisement Supported by A lively DealBook Summit task force agreed on little except that the electorate is restless. ByAlina Tugend This article is part of our special section on theDealBook Summitthat included business and policy leaders from around the world. The 2024 presidential election isn’t over. While the vote count is official and President-elect Donald J. Trump will be the next occupant of the Oval Office, just about everything else, including how much of a mandate he has, why the Democrats lost and what the future of the two political parties — and the country — will look like, is still the subject of fierce debate. That came through strongly during a discussion on Dec. 4 at the DealBook Summit in New York City about the election and its aftermath. The 10-member election task force, one of four held away from the main stage, included those involved in politics, the media and advocacy. Early on, the lines were set: Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, thanked other task force members for joining him in “celebrating President Trump’s victory.” Shortly afterward, Sarah Longwell, an outspoken Republican against Mr. Trump and publisher of the websiteThe Bulwark,described Mr. Trump as “the most dangerous criminal human being that America has ever elected.” And, she said, gesturing at Kevin McCarthy, former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and another task force member, “you’re the one who went down and resurrected him,” referring to Mr. McCarthy’s visit to Mar-a-Lago shortly after the Jan. 6 insurrection. To which Mr. McCarthy replied, “You’re welcome.” Not all exchanges were testy, but that did not mean there was a meeting of minds. Democrats on the panel rejected Republicans’ assertion that the victory was a sweep. Kellyanne Conway, the campaign manager for the 2016 Trump campaign and former senior counselor, declared the election “a rejection of wokeness,” while Alexis McGill Johnson, chief executive and president of Planned Parenthood, called it “a rollback on 50 to 100 years of progress that we have been making among communities of color, among gender, among people who just want to live their lives.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Women Need More Help to Rise in the Workplace,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/dealbook/women-workplace-advancement.html,"DealBookSummit Advertisement Supported by A DealBook Summit panel said a lack of helpful policies was hindering female advancement, while freezing eggs to postpone motherhood did not always work out. ByLeslie Wayne This article is part of our special section on theDealBook Summitthat included business and policy leaders from around the world. While women appear to be doing better in many ways — two have even run for U.S. president as major party candidates — there has been limited progress in gaining leadership positions in business. That has to do with a lack of corporate and government policies to support women as they balance work life and home demands, concluded a task force of female business leaders, entrepreneurs and activists convened by The New York Times at the DealBook Summit on Dec. 4. There is no question that women have made some major gains: Women now sit on the Supreme Court and Joint Chiefs of Staff, are among House leadership, and even on the International Space Station. Still, women hold only 10 percent of the leadership positions of Fortune 500 companies. “Do you see that as depressing?” asked Jodi Kantor, a New York Times reporter who moderated the panel. “Do you see that as enormous progress?” The hard question, she said, is “why at the time when women are really, in so many ways, doing better than ever in society — have experienced so much educational, social, financial progress — why is progress still limited in the business world in leadership positions?” Corporations and the U.S. government have done little, the panel agreed, to make it easier for women to juggle caregiving demands with the time and dedication required to climb the corporate ladder. What is needed are policies providing for greater paternity leave, more diversity in the workplace, better child care options and a more flexible work environment, they said. Donna Langley, chairman of NBCUniversal Entertainment & Studios, said it was a pivotal moment. “We’ve got to hunker down, pivot, shift our strategies, really think about how we harness all the power that we have accumulated over the last few years, and put it to use, but in a different way than we’ve been doing it,” she said.

Technologists: Smarter-Than-Humans A.I. Will Likely Be Here by 2030,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/dealbook/technology-artificial-general-intelligence.html,"DealBookSummit Advertisement Supported by Most members of a DealBook Summit panel described immense benefits from artificial intelligence and saw its risks as manageable. BySteve Lohr This article is part of our special section on theDealBook Summitthat included business and policy leaders from around the world. Powerful technologies have always been double-edged swords. That’s been true since fire; it could cook your food and keep you warm, but, out of control, burn down your hut. Modern artificial intelligence is poised to take the mixed-blessing principle to new heights, a technology moving faster and further than anything seen before. That was the prevailing view of 10 leading technologists and tech policy experts in a discussion on Dec. 4 at the DealBook Summit in New York, led by Kevin Roose, a columnist for The New York Times and co-host of the “Hard Fork” podcast. Big tech, venture capital, nonprofits and academia were all represented on the panel. The group was mainly a collection of people who believe that artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing. To start off, Mr. Roose asked for a show of hands of those who agreed with the statement that there was a 50 percent chance or better that artificialgeneralintelligence — a system with the ability to outperform human experts at virtually all cognitive tasks — would be achieved by 2030. Seven hands went up. Smarter-than-humans technology could deliver “a century of scientific progress in 10 years,” saidJack Clark, co-founder and head of policy at Anthropic, a richly funded A.I. start-up. Peter Lee, the president of Microsoft’s research division, said he was excited by how the underlying mathematical models that had excelled at learning from human language to create chatbots like ChatGPT were “just as adept at learning from nature.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Bipartisan Lawmakers Seek to Break Up Giant Health Care Conglomerates,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/warren-hawley-pharmacy-benefit-managers.html,"Advertisement Supported by New legislation would force UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna to each sell their pharmacies within three years. ByRebecca RobbinsandReed Abelson Members of Congress are pushing legislation that threatens to break up some of the nation’s biggest health care conglomerates, including UnitedHealth Group and CVS Health, by forcing them to sell off their retail or mail-order pharmacies. Thefederal legislation, introduced on Wednesday by a group of prominent Republican and Democratic lawmakers, would prohibit companies that own drug middlemen or health insurers from also owning pharmacy businesses.It is the most aggressive legislative effort in recent years to target those drug middlemen, known as pharmacy benefit managers, or P.B.M.s — companies hired by employers and government programs to oversee their prescription drug benefits. The three largest P.B.M.s — CVS Health’s Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth’s Optum Rx — collectively control80 percentof prescriptions in the United States. It’s not clear whether the legislation will gain traction. While there has been a bipartisan push to rein in the largest P.B.M.s with legislation requiring more transparency and modest changes to pricing practices, those bills have stalled in Congress and have been met with tremendous resistance from the powerful health care lobbies. The new legislation signals a renewed effort by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to take on the issue. “P.B.M.s have manipulated the market to enrich themselves — hiking up drug costs, cheating employers and driving small pharmacies out of business,” one of the sponsors of the legislation, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement. Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, is the co-sponsor of the Senate bill. A companion bill is being introduced in the House. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

F.D.A. Tries Last-Ditch Move to Slash Nicotine Levels in Cigarettes,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/health/fda-low-nicotine-cigarettes-biden.html,"Advertisement The agency is asking the White House, in the final days of the Biden era, to move ahead with plans to drastically reduce the addictive substance in traditional tobacco cigarettes. ByChristina Jewett In the final days of the Biden administration, the Food and Drug Administration is seeking White House approval to propose a drastic reduction in the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, a longstanding goal of public health experts that has faced stiff opposition from the powerful tobacco lobby. The F.D.A. submitted the proposal to the Office of Management and Budget only on Tuesday, a sign that the move was perhaps more wishful and symbolic than realistic for a White House juggling many late-term agenda items. And traditionally, the budget office’s review of agency proposals can take months. “I think it’s a milestone in progress toward the single most game-changing tobacco regulatory policy, in terms of lives that could be saved, that F.D.A. could ever do,” said Mitch Zeller, a former director of the agency’s tobacco center. “Having said that, it’s only a proposed rule, and we’re obviously in the waning days and weeks of an outgoing administration.” Even if the F.D.A. receives clearance from the White House to advance the proposal, whether it can survive once President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January is unclear given the sustained opposition from the industry. Thetobacco lobbywas also a significant donor to Mr. Trump’s campaign; the cigarette maker Reynolds American had given $8.5 million to his main super PAC by late October. Mr. Trump is known to personally oppose cigarette smoking, but has not weighed in recently on agency issues like nicotine levels in cigarettes. He has chosen Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his likely nominee to run the nation’s top health agency, and Mr. Kennedy hasrailed againstfederal subsidies given to tobacco growers, saying they eclipse those sent to other farmers who grow fruits and vegetables. He listed the problem as evidence that “we are just poisoning” people and contributing to chronic disease. “It makes no sense if we want a healthy country,” he said in aspeech in August. AWorld Health Organization study estimatedin 2023 that the U.S. Agriculture Department allocated $437 million in subsidies to tobacco farmers from 2015 through 2020.

Supreme Court Won’t Decide Nvidia Securities Fraud Case After All,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/supreme-court-nvidia-securities-fraud.html,"Supreme Court Advertisement Supported by In an unsigned order, the justices dismissed the case against the tech giant as “improvidently granted,” meaning they had concluded that it had been a mistake to take it up. ByAdam Liptak Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court, whichheard arguments last monthabout whether to allow a lawsuit accusing Nvidia of misrepresenting its reliance on the cryptocurrency mining industry, announced on Wednesday that it would not decide the case after all. Inan unsigned, one-sentence opinion, the court dismissed the case as “improvidently granted,” meaning the justices concluded that it had been a mistake to take it up. There were no noted dissents. The practical effect of the decision was to leave in placean appeals court decisionthat had let much of the case proceed. The move followed a similar one in November in another securities fraud case, against Facebook, which had been accused of failing to adequately disclose a data breach that allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest the private information of millions of users. In that case, too, the dismissal let standan appeals court ruling, allowing the case to proceed. Atthe argument in the Nvidia case, several members of the court across the ideological spectrum expressed frustration with the lawyers’ arguments. Some justices suggested that the court should not have granted review. “This is a highly technical subject,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said, “and I just don’t understand how a court is supposed to evaluate that” at a preliminary stage. Justice Elena Kagan made a similar point to a lawyer for Nvidia, now the dominant manufacturer of chips for artificial intelligence services. “It just seems to me that you’re asking us to engage in a kind of analysis that we are not very good at and weren’t expecting to when we took this case,” she said, adding that “it becomes less and less clear why we took this case.” The question before the justices was whether an investment firm and a pension fund suing Nvidia for securities fraud had satisfied a 1995 law, thePrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act, which tightened the requirements for how much detail investors had to provide at the outset of such suits. The law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgwrote in 2007, had “twin goals: to curb frivolous, lawyer-driven litigation, while preserving investors’ ability to recover on meritorious claims.” Lawyers for Nvidia argued that the plaintiffs had not cleared two hurdles imposed by the law. One required detailed accusations about which statements from the company were false and how. The other required plaintiffs to describe “facts giving rise to a strong inference” that company officials knew the statements were false.

Albertsons Backs Out of Merger Deal and Sues Kroger After Court Rulings,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/albertsons-kroger-merger-deal.html,"Advertisement Supported by The supermarket chain had tried to join forces with Kroger, but judges sided with federal and state regulators who charged that the merger would reduce competition. ByDanielle Kaye The grocery chain Albertsons said on Wednesday that it had backed out of its $25 billion merger with Kroger and sued its rival for failing to adequately push for regulatory approval, after both a federal and state judge blocked the deal on Tuesday. The deal, which would have been the biggest grocery store merger in U.S. history, faced three separate legal challenges — one filed by the Federal Trade Commission — over concerns that the combined company would reduce competition and raise prices. Judge Adrienne Nelson of U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon temporarily halted the deal on Tuesday, siding with federal regulators who have argued that the merger would lessen competition at the expense of consumers and workers. Another decision blocking the merger in Washington State court, issued by Judge Marshall Ferguson just one hour later, added to the hurdles facing the companies. “Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,” Vivek Sankaran, chief executive of Albertsons, said in a statement. “We are deeply disappointed in the courts’ decisions.” On Wednesday, Albertsons also said it filed a lawsuit against Kroger in the Delaware Court of Chancery, seeking billions of dollars in damages and accusing Kroger of failing to exercise “best efforts” to secure regulatory approval. Kroger refused to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignored regulators’ feedback and rejected strong buyers of stores it had planned to divest, Albertsons said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. Erin Rolfes, a spokeswoman for Kroger, disputed Albertsons’s claims, calling them “without merit.” Albertsons breached the merger agreement multiple times, she said in a statement, and the company filed the lawsuit in an attempt to deflect responsibility and seek payment for the merger’s termination fee.

Macy’s Details Multimillion-Dollar Accounting Error in Downbeat Report,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/macys-earnings-accounting-error.html,"Advertisement Supported by Analysts see much bigger challenges for the retailer than lax accounting. ByJordyn Holman With just two weeks until Christmas, Macy’s has been operating under a cloud. It lifted, in part, when the retailer on Wednesday gave more details about how an employeehad hidden more than $150 millionin expenses over the past few years. The company said the effect was not “material,” but it had to revise its previous accounts and lower its forecast for profits this year. That was unwelcome news as it enters the most important selling season. Macy’ssaid in a filingthat a single employee, who is no longer with the company, “intentionally made erroneous accounting entries and falsified underlying documentation, to understate delivery expenses” from late 2021 through the third quarter of this year. On a call with analysts, Adrian Mitchell, Macy’s finance chief, said the error was not made for personal financial gain. “This was not theft,” he said. “There was no impact to revenues, and there was no impact to cash or inventories as all vendors were fully paid.” The company said it was taking measures to improve its financial controls. But concerns still remain about how the retailer will turn around weak sales and fend off activist investors pushing for major changes. Macy’s slightly raised its full-year forecast for revenue, but still expected a slight decline in comparable sales. After making adjustments for the accounting error, it also cut its forecast for profitability, hitting its already beleaguered stock, which fell 6 percent. Macy’s said its operating income last quarter fell 23 percent from the previous year. Inventory increased, a sign of adding new merchandise that the company hoped to sell as it prepared for its biggest quarter of the year. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The F.T.C.’s Next, More Deal-Friendly Leader",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/dealbook/ftc-trump-ferguson-khan.html,"Advertisement Supported by DealBook Newsletter Andrew Ferguson is expected to go easier on mergers than the agency’s current chief, Lina Khan. But he could take a similarly tough approach to policing Big Tech. ByAndrew Ross SorkinRavi MattuBernhard WarnerSarah KesslerMichael J. de la MercedLauren HirschandJeanna Smialek Donald Trump’s picks for merger enforcement is complete: The president-elect has chosenAndrew Ferguson to lead the Federal Trade Commission, making him one of the nation’s top antitrust cops — and an almost polar opposite to the agency’s current leader, Lina Khan. The choice validates the view of corporate deal makers that a second Trump administration would be good for M.&A., after Khan challenged big takeovers to help shift antitrust case law. (More on that below.) But Ferguson shares a belief with his predecessor: the need to crack down on Big Tech. Ferguson will almost certainly scrap Khan’s signature merger policy.The departing F.T.C. chair — along with Jonathan Kanter, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division — made a point of opposing far more mergers than many of her forebears. Not every case ended in victory, but legal experts said that her approach helped reshape aspects of U.S. competition law and slowed down the pace of M.&A. That approach is likely to end under Ferguson, an F.T.C. commissioner who has objected to Khan’s activist strategy. (He’ll have the votes at the agency, with Trump having also picked Mark Meador to join as a commissioner, most likely giving Republicans a majority.) In a pitch for the agency leadership position seen by Punchbowl News, Ferguson, who doesn’t need Senate confirmation, said he would “reverse Lina Khan’s anti-business agenda.” Wall Street has been eager for looser merger enforcement,hoping to profit from increased deal activity andother deregulation. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,”David Solomon, Goldman Sachs’s C.E.O., said on Tuesday at the Reuters NEXT conference. He added that deal volume in 2025 alone could exceed the 10-year average. But Ferguson may follow Khan in cracking down on tech giants — in a different way.Under Khan, the agency sued the likes ofAmazonandMeta, accusing them of abusing their dominant market share. As recently as last month, she reportedly signed off on awide-ranging investigation into Microsoftover cloud computing, artificial intelligence and more.

Exxon Plans to Sell Electricity to Data Centers,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-data-centers-power-plant.html,"Advertisement Supported by The country’s largest oil company is designing a natural gas power plant outfitted with carbon capture technology to meet the voracious power demand of technology companies. ByRebecca F. Elliott Demand for electricity is rising so quickly in the United States that even Exxon Mobil, the country’s largest oil and gas company, is planning to get into the power business. Exxon is designing a massive natural-gas fueled plant meant to directly supply electricity to data centers. The company says the plant will be fitted with technology that can capture more than 90 percent of the complex’s carbon dioxide emissions, the leading cause of climate change. The project, which is in the early stages of development, would be the first time that Exxon built a power plant that did not supply electricity to its own operations. In addition, only a very small number of power plants have systems to capture the carbon dioxide released by the burning of fuel before it reaches the atmosphere. Such systems have been slow to take off because they are incredibly expensive, even with federal subsidies. However, technology giants have beenwilling to pay a premiumfor cleaner sources of electricity that can operate continuously, including nuclear power plants. Exxon said it had secured land and was talking with potential customers. The company also said it could have the power plant running within the next five years, faster than new nuclear reactors could probably be built. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Inflation Ticks Up, but Details Are Encouraging for the Fed",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/inflation-cpi-november.html,"U.S. Economy Advertisement Supported by Inflation sped up last month, but the details suggested cooling ahead.

Still, the details of the report probably gave central bank officials enough confidence to cut interest rates at their meeting next week. The Consumer Price Index climbed 2.7 percent in the year through November, just slightly faster than the 2.6 percent reading in October. After volatile food and fuel costs were stripped out for a better sense of the underlying inflation trend, “core” inflation held steady at 3.3 percent. But drilling into the details of the report, a long-awaited slowdown in housing cost inflation materialized last month. Because rental costs make up such a big chunk of overall inflation, that could pave the way for cooler inflation readings going forward. Taken as a whole, the figures are likely to reaffirm the Fed’s view that after several months of little to no progress, price increases have more room to slow. While inflation is much cooler than the 9.1 percent peak it reached in 2022, it remains above the Fed’s goal. Central bankers aim for 2 percent inflation, a target they define using a different but related index, the Personal Consumption Expenditures measure. Thatwill come out on Dec. 20, so this is the last big inflation report officials will have in hand before their Dec. 17-18 meeting. “It gives the Fed enough confidence to cut interest rates on the 18th,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. “Then, I think, they pause a bit in early 2025.

Biden Administration Looks to Reinforce U.S.-China Ties Ahead of Trump’s Return,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/us-china-ties-trump.html,"Advertisement Supported by Senior Treasury officials are holding a final round of talks with a new round of economic volatility on the horizon. ByAlan Rappeport Alan Rappeport traveled to China twice with Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen for economic talks. The Biden administration is making a final push to reinforce the communication channels it established between the United States and China before the relationship between the world’s largest economies potentially faces fresh upheaval when President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office next month. A team of senior Treasury Department officials will travel to Nanjing, China, this week for a final meeting of the U.S.-China financial working group. A separate group of Treasury officials will convene with their Chinese counterparts on the sidelines of a Group of 20 gathering in South Africa this week for a meeting of the bilateral economic working group. Theworking groups were formed in 2023as a way to prevent tension between the U.S. and China from devolving into economic warfare. The officials are expected to discussa familiar range of issuesthat have been on the table since the new structure for economic dialogue was created last year. The United States is expected to raise its continued concerns about China’s excess production of green energy technology, which is flooding global markets. Treasury officials are also expected to raise issues with China’s recent restrictions on exports of critical minerals and the support that Chinese firms have been providing to Russia in its war against Ukraine. “The United States and China are the two largest economies on the globe, and the American people expect that we should be able to communicate directly with Chinese officials on both areas where we agree and especially on areas where we don’t,” said Jay Shambaugh, the Treasury Department’s under secretary for international affairs, who will be participating in the meetings. Treasury officials say that the increased engagement has given the United States a better understanding of China’s economy and how its policymakers view sensitive issues such as foreign exchange policy and international debt relief. They also point to regular “technical exercises” that the two sides have been conducting to help maintain financial stability in the event of a crisis as a channel that will be valuable in the future. Despite the warmer tone between the two countries, most of the Biden administration’s warnings about China flooding global markets with cheap solar panels and electric vehicles have gone unheeded. There has also been no indication that Chinese firms have stopped helping Russia access the technology that it needs to restock its military. And the U.S. and China have continued to ratchet up protectionist measures. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Opioids Ravaged a Kentucky Town. Then Rehab Became Its Business.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/magazine/opioid-addiction-recovery-kentucky-louisa.html,"In Louisa, an unbearable social crisis has become the main source of economic opportunity. Welding trainees in the kitchen of their shared home, Stone Lodge, in Louisa, Ky. Addiction Recovery Care, which is based in town, operates the home and the business where they work.Credit...Stacy Kranitz for The New York Times Supported by ByOliver Whang Oliver Whang visited Louisa many times over a few years for this article, speaking to people in addiction and recovery, medical staff, teachers, police officers, judges and local business owners. Louisa, Ky., is a small town of about 2,600 on the border of West Virginia with a single pair of railroad tracks running through it. If you follow these tracks south, against the flow of the Big Sandy River, you’ll go between the public library and the Main Street Park and over Lick Creek, one of the manifold creeks that web eastern Kentucky like capillaries. Follow Lick Creek past a baseball diamond and a pawnshop and you’ll arrive behind an ordinary gray mobile home in a small lot of grass where Ingrid Jackson was living in the fall of 2023. The days were still long and the afternoon sun settled gently on nearby mountains, turning leaves a lambent red. Reedy gospel music played from inside the trailer, announcing Jackson’s presence as she opened the door. Her hair, normally figured in light brown curls, was packed into a shower cap. She smiled from the entryway. It was a smile difficult not to smile back at. Jackson had never lived in a trailer before, or a small town. She was born in Louisville, the daughter of a man with schizophrenia who, in 1983, decapitated a 76-year-old woman. Jackson was 1 at the time. In 2010, at 27, she was in a car accident and was prescribed pain pills. Not long after that, she began using heroin. Over the next decade she went through nine rounds of addiction rehab. Each ended in relapse. Her most recent one came in 2022 after her son was sentenced to life in prison for murder; he was 21. In Louisville on Christmas Day she called a residential rehab company named Addiction Recovery Care, which has its headquarters in Louisa. So now she was here, in Appalachian coal country, in a trailer along Lick Creek, in a town a tiny fraction the size of her home city, working as a nursing assistant in a nearby nursing home, sharing a trailer with Latasha Kidd, a local woman 12 years her junior with a mountain accent, a fade and blood-orange bangs. “This is culture shock,” Jackson said. “I’m a city girl, and there’s not a lot of us around, and I’m like: Mama!” Jackson and Kidd were about as different as you could make them. Jackson was Black, Kidd white; Jackson outgoing, Kidd reserved; Jackson neat, Kidd messy; Jackson devout, Kidd agnostic; Jackson straight, Kidd queer. Still, they became fast friends in rehab and now, five months out, inhabited a somewhat fragile existence together, in the period of addiction recovery that many people in long-term recovery say is the most difficult: the space between leaving rehab and getting back on your feet.More than a million peoplein the United States are arrested every year on drug-related charges, and for them, finding a steady job, consistent housing and reliable transportation can be even more difficult than the tremors, hallucinations and nausea of detox.Studies have shownthat relapse rates for people in recovery may be as high as 85 percent within the first year. Another woman with whom Kidd and Jackson went through recovery, who was supposed to live with them, relapsed and overdosed the day before moving in. Jackson often worried that something similar might happen to Kidd, who had struggled with addiction so long that, until recently, she didn’t know how to pay her bills. At 29, Kidd hadn’t yet held a full-time job. “So I have to push her sometimes,” Jackson said. “ ’Cause when I want to go in my own direction, I don’t want Tasha to be left upside-down.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"For Tesla Owners, a Referendum Through Bumper Stickers",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/style/tesla-bumper-stickers.html,"Advertisement Supported by As Elon Musk has become a key player in President-elect Donald J. Trump’s world, Tesla owners are marking their cars to signify where they stand — for or against. ByEve Peyser It was the last week of October, with the election fast approaching, and business was booming for Matthew Hiller. His Etsy shop was receiving hundreds of orders per day. He was preparing to leave for vacation in France, and was hoping that while he was away Elon Musk wouldn’t do anything “particularly crazy.” It may seem strange, but every time Mr. Musk, the Tesla chief executive, causes a stir, Mr. Hiller has to fulfill orders for his online shops. The most popular of the items that he sells? Bumper stickers that say, in all-caps, “I Bought This Before We Knew Elon Was Crazy.” For his vacation, Mr. Hiller asked a friend to cover for him. “I don’t know how she’s going to manage this,” he said. With Mr. Musk frequenting rallies in support of Donald J. Trump and posting on X relentlessly at the time, Mr. Hiller was dubious that business would slow. He had no idea that things were about to get far more hectic with Mr. Trump’s winning the presidential election and Mr. Musk’s status as his close ally. Mr. Muskspent more than $250 million on the 2024 election, according to federal filings, and then immediately stepped in asa key part of Mr. Trump’s transition team. Few business executives are as closely associated with their products as Mr. Musk, so his rise in the world of far-right politics led to plenty of celebration among Trump-supporting Tesla owners, but plenty of consternation among those who disagreed with the move, or who had simply grown tired of Mr. Musk. The solution, for many Tesla owners on both ends of that spectrum, has been to slap a bumper sticker on their car to let people know how they feel about Mr. Musk. Mr. Hiller, who lives in Honolulu and works at the Waikiki Aquarium, became a key player in the situation by being ahead of the curve thanks to his side business: an Etsy shop called Mad Puffer Stickers.

The St. Fergus Gas Terminal, north of Aberdeen, Scotland, where natural gas from the North Sea lands on the country’s coast.Credit...Robert Ormerod for The New York Times Supported by ByStanley Reed Reporting from Aberdeen, Scotland The government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain finds itself in a quandary. It came to power promising to lead aclean energyboom that it said would revive a stagnant economy and protect consumers from energy price surges that were driving up inflation. Yet it also seems wary of setting off a collapse of the oil and gas industry in the North Sea that sustains an estimated 120,000 mostly well-paid jobs and produces much of the natural gas that keep British businesses and homes humming. “While we make that transition, the oil and gas industry will play an important role in the economy for decades to come,” Britain’s energy minister, Michael Shanks, said this year. Already there is unease about a sharp slowdown in investment among energy companies and what strikes some as indifference on the part of Britain’s new government, led by the Labour Party, to the potential consequences. Britain has “been a leader in offshore development,” said Gregor Scott, managing director of Ocean Installer, which does underwater work. “We won’t maintain that forever if there is a dwindling amount of work.” In the coming months, the government will face a tricky balancing act of pursuing its clean energy agenda while supporting an industry that the country still relies on for energy and jobs.

Houthi Attacks Turn Back the Clock for Shipping as Costs Pile Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/houthi-red-sea-attacks-shipping-lanes-africa.html,"The transport route around the southern tip of Africa was once little used — but freighters are now forced to take it and are charging higher rates. Capt. Tobias Kammann on his freighter, the Hanoi Express, docked in Hamburg, Germany. Ships’ access to the Suez Canal has been cut off for the last year by attackers in Yemen.Credit...Patrick Junker for The New York Times Supported by ByPeter EavisandLiz Alderman Peter Eavis reported from New York and Liz Alderman from Piraeus, Greece. Before this year, Tobias Kammann, a German container ship captain, had only once sailed around the southern tip of Africa, and the lack of other vessels in the little-trafficked waters made him feel very much alone. But these days, there are so many ships there, he said, that “it’s a bit like the autobahn.” To get from Asia to Europe and back, global shipping companies have for decades sailed through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. But a year ago, the Houthi insurgents in Yemen began targeting vessels in the Red Sea with drones and missiles, forcing shipping companies to divert their cargo around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip, a route that is some 3,500 nautical miles and 10 days longer. Western-led naval fleets were sent to the Red Sea to quell the attacks, which the Iran-backed Houthis said were a response to Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza. Despite those deployments, the attacks continued, and commercial vessels have, for the most part, stayed away. And Middle East analysts said they expected the Houthis to keep up their attacks even as Iran’s influence in the regionhas diminishedafter the weakening of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria. It’s as if the shipping industry had been transported back to the days before the Suez Canal opened in 1869. “This is one of the most significant challenges that shipping has faced in a long time,” said Salvatore Mercogliano, a maritime historian and an associate professor at Campbell University in North Carolina.

Judge Rejects Sale of Infowars to The Onion,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/business/media/the-onion-infowars-alex-jones.html,"Advertisement Supported by The Onion’s bid for the conspiracy website was supported by the families of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting and a nonprofit focused on ending gun violence. ByBenjamin MullinandElizabeth Williamson A judge late Tuesday night said he would not approve the sale of Infowars, the website founded by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, to the Chicago-based satirical publication The Onion, prolonging a messy tug of war between two high-profile suitors. The ruling, by Judge Christopher M. Lopez in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, poses a roadblock for The Onion’s plan to take possession of the Infowars site and its associated assets after itwon an auction last month. The Onion’s bid was backed by the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, who in 2022 won a $1.4 billion defamation lawsuit against Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones spent years claiming that the 2012 school shooting was a hoax and that victims’ family members were actors complicit in the plot. The Onion has said that it wants to turn Infowars into a satirical site mocking the kind of conspiracy theories that Mr. Jones spreads. Judge Lopez’s ruling put the fate of Infowars in limbo. He instructed a court-appointed trustee, Christopher Murray, to come up with an alternative resolution, though it was not immediately clear what approach Mr. Murray would take. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ben Collins, the chief executive of Global Tetrahedron, The Onion’s parent company, said the publication was “deeply disappointed” by Tuesday’s decision. He added that The Onion would “continue to seek a resolution that helps the Sandy Hook families receive a positive outcome for the horror they endured,” adding that the company would continue its pursuit of Infowars in the coming weeks.

Biden Says Trump’s Tax Cuts and Tariffs Would Be ‘a Major Mistake’,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/biden-trump-tax-cuts-tariffs.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Supported by The president also said his successor would face blowback from the Republican Party if he tried to unwind the Biden agenda. ByZolan Kanno-Youngs Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent. He reported from Washington. President Biden said on Tuesday that President-elect Donald J. Trump’s plans to impose tax cuts for the wealthy and sweeping tariffs would be “a major mistake,” while warning that the incoming president would face blowback from Republicans if he moved to unwind the Biden agenda. During what the White House billed as a “legacy speech,” Mr. Biden for nearly 40 minutes defended his proposals toreshape American manufacturingand cautioned that Mr. Trump’s economic vision would hurt working-class Americans. “He seems determined to impose steep, universal tariffs on all important goods brought into this country on the mistaken belief that foreign countries will bear the cost of those tariffs, rather than the American consumer,” Mr. Biden said at the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit think tank. Since Mr. Trump’s election win last month, Mr. Biden has gone relatively quiet with his attacks on his political rival in what White House aides say is an intentional effort to focus on a peaceful transfer of power. But as Mr. Trump finalizes plans for his new administration, Mr. Biden went on the offensive against his policy proposals. Mr. Biden scoffed at Mr. Trump’s failure to pass an infrastructure package and warned that his tax cuts would increase the deficit or cut federal social services programs. He mocked Mr. Trump’s handling of the pandemic and accused him of embracing Project 2025, a right-wing policy blueprint to expand executive power and replace civil servants. Mr. Trump had tried to distance himself from the plans to overhaul the federal government during the presidential campaign, despite the fact that many of his former aides developed the proposals and he hasrecruited key architects of the project to his new administration.

G.M. Will Stop Developing Self-Driving Taxis,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/business/gm-cruise-robotaxi.html,"Advertisement Supported by The company said it would now focus its efforts on developing fully autonomous vehicles for personal use. ByJack EwingandEli Tan General Motors said on Tuesday that it would stop developing a taxi that can drive itself, ending a yearslong project that the company spent billions of dollars on and leaving the field to competitors like Tesla, Amazon and Waymo. The automaker said it would fold its Cruise subsidiary, which was working on that project, into its main operations, allowing formerly separate development teams to jointly develop fully autonomous vehicles for private owners. The decision removes G.M. from a business that some in the industry believe could someday be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, if researchers can solve formidable technological hurdles. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and other Silicon Valley executives have sketched a future where thousands of driverless cars ferry passengers to destinations. But Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M., suggested that the payoff was too far in the future to justify the expense of developing the technology, which has already cost the company $10 billion. “You have to understand the cost of running a robotaxi fleet, which is not our core business and is very expensive,” she said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday. Instead, she said, G.M. will focus on technology that will allow vehicles sold to consumers to steer, accelerate and brake without driver intervention under certain conditions. The goal is to eventually develop cars that can drive themselves without human supervision. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Fund-Raiser Who Pocketed Money Meant for Sick Kids and Vets Gets 10 Years in Prison,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/richard-zeitlin-prison.html,"Advertisement Supported by Richard Zeitlin, a telemarketing kingpin who kept 80 percent of the donations raised for charities, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in September. ByDavid A. FahrentholdandCamille Baker Reporting from New York If you owned a phone in America over the last 40 years, there is a good chance you got a call from Richard L. Zeitlin. He ran a telemarketing empire out of Las Vegas, using computers that mimicked human callers to raise money for charitable and political causes. Police and police dogs. Vietnam veterans and breast cancer victims. Missing children and disabled children and children with cancer. He raised more than $145 million, mainly small gifts from small donors, but he kept at least 80 percent of it. For the most part, Mr. Zeitlin did that legally — exploiting loose rules and lax regulation of fund-raisers, and becoming an infamous example of how donors’ generosity could be quietly siphoned into private hands. He seemed to relish the role of antihero, suing his own regulators and setting up awebsiteto criticize journalists who reported that he had kept much of the money he raised instead of helping others with it. Then, after years of skirting the law, Mr. Zeitlin broke it — and brought down the whole empire. “My whole life, I’ve been afraid of being broke,” he told U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan on Tuesday afternoon in New York. Mr. Zeitlin was asking for lenience, after pleading guilty in September to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. “It made me make some very bad decisions.” Mr. Zeitlin, 54, is a Wisconsin native who started in telemarketing as a teenager. His operation relied on soundboards — computers pre-loaded with dialogue from voice actors. The operator “talked” by playing snippets. Mr. Zeitlinwrotethat the computers, unlike a human, would never misread the script, never argue, never insult a donor. In 1988, the U.S. Supreme Courtruledthat the First Amendment barred states from setting any limits on a charity fund-raiser’s fees. Mr. Zeitlin took advantage.

U.S. Transfers $20 Billion Loan to Ukraine Backed by Russian Assets,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/20-billion-dollar-loan-ukraine.html,"Russia-UkraineWar Advertisement Supported by The economic lifeline ensures that Ukraine will have economic support after President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office. ByAlan Rappeport Reporting from Washington The Biden administration transferred $20 billion to Ukraine on Tuesday, providing an urgently needed economic lifeline in the form of a loan that will be repaid using interest earned from Russia’s frozen central bank assets. The transfer of the funds comes as Ukraine is facing a period of grave uncertainty with President-elect Donald J. Trump poised to take office next month and Russia’s war continuing unabated. Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress are unlikely to continue to provide Ukraine with the same levels of economic and military support as the country received from Democrats and the Biden administration. But the conflict continues, and Ukraine has relied heavily on international aid to keep its economy afloat. The $20 billion is part of a $50 billion loan that the Group of 7 nations devised andagreed upon earlier this year. The United States and the European Union enacted sanctions to freeze Russia’s central bank assets, most of which are held in Europe, after its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen gathered members of her staff in her large conference room and officials watched as the $20 billion transfer was executed on a laptop from the Treasury Department to the World Bank, which will then disburse it to Ukraine. Ms. Yellen described the loan as one of the most important things that she had been involved with during her time in the job, according to a person who was in the room. After extended deliberations over how that money could be used to aid Ukraine, officials agreed that they would use the interest that the assets were earning to back a loan. That approach effectively forces Russia to pay for the damage it has caused in Ukraine, and has allowed the United States and Europe to provide aid without putting an additional economic burden on their taxpayers.

Federal Judge Blocks $25 Billion Kroger-Albertsons Grocery Merger,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/business/kroger-albertsons-merger-ftc.html,"Advertisement Supported by The ruling, citing a potential loss of competition, was a victory for the Federal Trade Commission. Later, a Washington State judge blocked the deal on similar grounds. ByDanielle Kaye The biggest grocery store merger in U.S. history was dealt a double blow on Tuesday: Within less than two hours, both a federal and a state judge moved to block the deal. Judge Adrienne Nelson of U.S. District Court in Oregon sided with the Federal Trade Commission in its lawsuit seeking to halt Kroger’s $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons, a rival grocery chain. It was a win for federal regulators who have argued that the merger would risk reducing competition at the expense of consumers and workers. The grocery chains “engage in substantial head-to-head competition and the proposed merger would remove that competition,” Judge Nelson said in her decision, calling the merger “presumptively unlawful.” Her preliminary injunction placed the merger on shaky ground as it heads to the final step to determine the deal’s fate: the F.T.C.’s internal administrative process. About an hour after the federal ruling, a judge in Washington State also blocked the deal on the grounds that it could substantially lessen competition. Another state challenge in Colorado is still pending. Kroger and Albertsons could choose to abandon their merger because of the preliminary injunction, but the order at the federal level “in no way forces them to do so,” Judge Nelson added, stressing that the companies could still pursue the deal if it is deemed lawful in the F.T.C.’s administrative proceedings. “An injunction simply pauses the merger,” she said. The ruling in the Washington State case, however, added to the hurdles facing the companies, which have argued that they need to merge in order to compete with behemoths like Walmart and Amazon.

Eric Trump Promises the ‘Most Pro-Crypto President’ in History,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/eric-trump-cryptocurrency-conference.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Supported by Speaking at a Middle East conference, President-elect Donald J. Trump’s son said his family had embraced cryptocurrency because some banks stopped doing business with them after Jan. 6. ByIsmaeel NaarEric LiptonandDavid Yaffe-Bellany Photographs byTamir Kalifa Ismaeel Naar and Tamir Kalifa reported from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Eric Lipton from Washington; and David Yaffe-Bellany from San Francisco. Eric Trump flew across the world to headline a cryptocurrency conference in the United Arab Emirates this week and told thousands of enthusiastic attendees that he and his father, the U.S. president-elect, were effectively working in tandem to push crypto, a business sector the family is directly invested in. The message was notable because it contrasted drastically with the promise the family made when Donald J. Trump entered the White House eight years ago, to keep business and government operations separate. Eric Trump said he had even phoned his father — “Pops,” he said he calls him — to celebrate when the price of Bitcoin hit $100,000 after the president-elect announced he intended to appoint a crypto-friendly lawyer as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the industry that the family now profits from. “You’re going to have the most pro-crypto president in the history of America,” Eric Trump told the crowd. “Think about a president who isn’t going to allow Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to be overregulated and stifled.” Eric Trump made the remarks at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference, where he also promoted the family’s new business venture, World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency platform. His comments to attendees signaled that the Trump family is more willing to publicly announce when the president-elect’s governing role will steer into his personal investments and that it is not as concerned as it was in his first administration about avoiding potential conflicts or the appearance of them.

U.S. Data Agency Blames Old Tech and Other Failures for Missteps,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/business/economy/bls-data-report.html,"Advertisement Supported by The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks jobs and inflation, issued a report on what caused embarrassing episodes in which data was released improperly. ByBen Casselman Outdated technology, inadequate funding and a failure to follow established procedures contributed toembarrassing misstepsat theBureau of Labor Statisticsthis year, a panel that examined the episodes said on Tuesday. Julie Su, the acting labor secretary, formed the 11-member group in September after abotched data releaseallowed some investors to see potentially market-moving employment data before the public. That followed two other episodes: one in February, in which an agency employeeprovided methodological informationto finance industry “super users”; and another, in May, in which inflation data was inadvertently posted to the agency’s website half an hour before its scheduled release. The panel was chaired by a former Labor Department official and consisted mostly of current officials from the department and other federal agencies. It also included two members of the public. Ms. Su gave the group 60 days to “identify causes of and fixes to the inaccurate release of data” and report back. The panel found that the three episodes were “unique and unrelated,” and noted that none of them related to the quality or accuracy of the agency’s data. But it argued that even the perception that the agency was poorly run, or that favored groups had early access to information, threatened to erode public trust in government data. “The smallest glitch can undermine months of high-quality data work in a moment,” the panel wrote in its report. Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, echoed that message in a call with reporters on Tuesday. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Finance Moguls Revel in Trump’s Return and Ignore the Peril,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/business/wall-street-trump.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Supported by The financial world sees plenty of opportunity in the return of President-elect Donald J. Trump. For now, Wall Streeters are looking past the risks. ByRob Copeland Rob Copeland, a finance reporter, has spent the weeks since the election speaking with Wall Street executives of all political leanings. The day after the presidential election, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, picked up his phone for a call he had hoped not to make. Mr. Dimon, who had privatelysupported Vice President Kamala Harrisand boasted to associates he hadn’t spoken to Donald J. Trump in years, was now in the position of calling the president-elect with congratulations and an offer to help in any way. Mr. Trump didn’t pick up, forcing Mr. Dimon to leave a message on his voice mail, according to two people with knowledge of the call. The snub — and a subsequent missive from Mr. Trump on social media that Mr. Dimon would “not be invited” to be a part of his administration — did not dampen the banker’s enthusiasm.Mr. Dimon said a few days laterthat his industry was “dancing in the street” over Mr. Trump’s win and incoming Republican majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate. These days, it seems that everyone who is anybody on Wall Street — to say nothing of a whole lot of nobodies — is amped up for Mr. Trump’s return to the Oval Office. In interviews, bankers, lawyers, investors and corporate executives with a wide range of political views said that despite mixed opinions on Mr. Trump’s proposed policies overall, they see in his administration the greatest possibility for a boon to the business world in a generation or more. In part, they’ve been won over by the president-elect’s picks of a fairly run-of-the-mill collection of Republican stalwarts for economic and financial regulatory roles. They expect this Wall Street-heavy crowd, such as Paul Atkins, a longtime lawyer for investment firms who is Mr. Trump’s pick for Securities and Exchange chairman, and Howard Lutnick, a billionaire investment banker as the commerce secretary designate, to focus on rote conservative causes like lighter financial regulation and lower taxes (or at least a continuation of tax cuts set to expire). Notably, the rosy outlook sidesteps some of the nonconformist economic ideas — namely tariffs on all imports to the United States — that Mr. Trump has pledged. It also takes as a given that the president-elect will continue to save his mostprovocative political picksfor bureaucracies such as the F.B.I. that financiers see as unrelated to their world.

"A Filmmaker, a Spy and France’s Richest Man Meet in a Paris Court",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/business/lvmh-bernard-arnault-spy-trial.html,"Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH, squared off with a documentary maker in a case of espionage gone wrong, a showdown that had been brewing for years. Credit...Illustration by Cristiana Couceiro; Photographs by Alamy Supported by ByLiz Alderman Liz Alderman spent three days in a Paris courtroom covering a corporate espionage trial. François Ruffin had just started filming a satirical documentary about Bernard Arnault, France’s richest man and head of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury conglomerate, when he became suspicious about a volunteer on his staff. The man, who went by the name Marc Foll, had been spotted digging through the trash. He leafed through papers on desks. He carried a camera pen and made conspiratorial remarks. Staff members began referring to him as “the mole.” In the film, Mr. Ruffin, 49, a gadfly journalist, sought to confront Mr. Arnault over decisions he had made, including outsourcing jobs and closing factories, that left thousands of former LVMH employees struggling. It was only years later that Mr. Ruffin confirmed his hunch — Mr. Foll was in fact a spy whose reports made their way back to LVMH. Details of the surveillance were exposed during an influence peddling trial last month concerning France’s former intelligence chief, Bernard Squarcini, whom LVMH had hired for security work after he left the post in 2012. Following a yearslong effort by Mr. Ruffin to press Mr. Arnault into contrition over lost jobs, the trial finally brought them into direct confrontation. The case attracted attention with its revelations. A shark and a mole. Fake names. A homeless spy. Mr. Arnault, 75, appeared in the packed Paris courtroom wearing a dark Dior suit and escorted by heavy security. For the famously publicity shy corporate titan, it was one of his rare appearances outside of his front-row seats at an LVMH fashion show. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But the nonagenarian media titan plans to appeal. ByAndrew Ross SorkinRavi MattuBernhard WarnerSarah KesslerMichael J. de la MercedLauren HirschEdmund LeeandSapna Maheshwari Rupert Murdoch haslost his bidto hand control over his media company to his elder son, Lachlan Murdoch, after he dies. A Nevada commissioner ruled against his attempt to modify the terms of a family trust that would have stripped three of his other children of their voting rights over his empire. The media mogul, who plans to appeal the ruling, is used to getting his way, The Times’s Edmund Lee writes for DealBook. Now what? A recap:Under the current arrangement, when Murdoch dies, four of his children — Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence — will have an equal say in what happens next because they will inherit his voting shares. But Elisabeth and James have different political leanings from Lachlan and their father, and James hasindirectly criticizedhow Fox News operates. The three siblings contested the attempts to change the trust. This was perhaps the last maneuver of Murdoch’s seven-decade career.The 93-year-old wanted to give Lachlan control over his news outlets — which include Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and major newspapers and television outlets in Australia and Britain — to maintain their right-leaning slant.

How Crypto Insiders Turned ‘Debanking’ Into a Political Storm,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/crypto-debanking-trump.html,"Advertisement Supported by Concerns that crypto companies are being purposely cut off from the global banking system have become a political cudgel at an opportune moment for the industry. ByErin GriffithandDavid Yaffe-Bellany Erin Griffith covers start-ups, and David Yaffe-Bellany writes about the cryptocurrency industry. Early last year, Ryne Saxe started fielding demands from banks that worked with his San Francisco-based start-up, Eco. They laid out a litany of new compliance and reporting requirements that Eco had to follow. The problem? Eco was a cryptocurrency company, part of an industry facing heavy scrutiny from regulators. The banks said they were under pressure from government agencies to follow new guidance about crypto clients. Then Bill.com, Eco’s payroll provider, canceled the company’s account, citing a new policy, Mr. Saxe said. After eight months of pressure, Mr. Saxe shut down Eco’s app and changed his business plan so that it did not rely on partnerships with banks. Eventually his Bill.com account was restored. “It was like hell,” he said. “We were getting progressively debanked.” For years, crypto start-ups like Eco have struggled to find and keep bank accounts in the United States, leading entrepreneurs to cry foul. In angry social media posts, they have accused the government of orchestrating a campaign to squelch the crypto industry, calling the crackdown unconstitutional and un-American. They havesued banking regulatorsand raised the issue with members of Congress. Those concerns have reached a boiling point. Last month, Marc Andreessen, an influential venture capitalist,appearedon Joe Rogan’s podcast, which reachesmore than 10 millionlisteners, and accused Democrats of “terrorizing” crypto start-ups by pressing banks not to work with them. His complaints wereamplifiedby Elon Musk, as well as crypto executives likeBrian Armstrong, the Coinbase C.E.O., and Tyler Winklevoss, who said the government and the banking sector were engaged in“evil behavior.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"At ‘Tax Prom,’ Washington Prepares for More Tax Cuts",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/tax-cuts-foundation-prom.html,"U.S. Economy Advertisement Supported by Republican control of Washington and a tax bill next year have corporate America excited — and on edge. ByAndrew Duehren Reporting from Washington Life was good for the tuxedoed and gowned tax lobbyists lined up last month along Washington’s waterfront to get into “Tax Prom,” a wonky event even by the standards of a city peopled by policy nerds. After a Republican sweep to power, Congress was starting to negotiate asweeping tax bill, a boon for an industry that thrives when lawmakers rework the tax code. The corporate tax rate could drop. Tax breaks for research and development could return. A deduction for the owners of many businesses would likely remain in place. So there was a sense of optimism at this year’s celebration of the capital’s tax professionals. Hosted annually by the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally favors lower taxes, and sponsored by major corporations, Tax Prom is Washington networking par excellence. Congressional staff and lobbyists chatted at the open bar. An advocacy group seeking higher taxes ran advertisements criticizing the event. Kim Reynolds, the Republican governor of Iowa who has repeatedly cut taxes, received the event’s annual award. Attendees availed themselves of the opportunity to make jokes about depreciation schedules — and maybe actually get a laugh. But even with the conditions ripe for cutting taxes next year, the village of consultants, lawyers and former congressional aides that lobby Capitol Hill were not ready to let its guard down. Tax cuts cost money, and some companies are on alert for Republicans that would pare back corporate tax breaks to save revenue. Various industries and companies have an array of sometimes conflicting demands of Congress, turning next year’s tax bill into another arena for corporate competition. Then there are those who don’t want to miss out an opportunity to worm an advantageous tax change into law. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Chasing the $100 Lift Ticket: 6 Mountains Where You Can Ski for Less,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/travel/ski-lift-tickets-under-100-dollars.html,"Advertisement Supported by The average price of a single-day lift ticket at a destination ski resort in the U.S. is $250, but there are plenty of smaller areas where getting on the slopes is much cheaper. ByElisabeth Vincentelli Every year, there seems to be a grim competition as to which North American mountain resorts will have the highest daily rate for a lift ticket: It’s scary times when $250 is the new average at marquee destinations. Yet it is still possible to ski for much less than that, even without committing to a multi-resort pass likeEpicorIkon. For starters, most of those sky-high prices are for last-minute single tickets bought at the window: Ski resorts harshly penalize impulse buyers and the unprepared, so always purchase ahead online as early as possible. Admittedly not everybody has the option to avoid weekends and holidays, but for those who can, skiing midweek makes a big difference. Daily rates in the two figures abound when you know where to look, even at mid- to large resorts: $99 onselect Thursdays at Copper Mountain, Colo., or $69 to $79 forLadies Day Thursday at Mt. Rose — Ski Tahoe, Nev. Finally, the $100 world is your oyster if you are open to trading high-end properties for smaller ones, like the six listed below. All rates are for an adult daily ticket. Smugglers’ Notch sits just north ofStowe,one of the most popular destinations in Vermont, though in winter when the mountain road between them is closed, it’s a 45-minute drive from one to the other. While Stowe is part of Vail Resorts and is on the Epic Pass, Smuggs, as it is nicknamed, is independent and has a laid-back, no-frills attitude. The skiable surface looks fairly small at 310 acres, but an additional 750 acres of glades are available for exploration. Weekends and holidays cost $119, but between Dec. 21 and March 30 you can ski for $85 midweek, and every day for a mere $65 before and after that.

Trump Tests Ethical Boundaries With Branded Merch. (And All Sales Are Final.),https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/us/politics/trump-perfumes-sneakers-licensing.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Supported by Everything around President-elect Donald J. Trump has become something to monetize, including a moment of comity with Jill Biden at Notre-Dame over the weekend. ByKatie Rogers Katie Rogers covers the White House and reported from Washington. Donald J. Trump learned a long time ago that photo opportunities could get him attention and that slapping his name on everything from skyscrapers to steaks could make him money. As a three-time presidential candidate and now the president-elect, he is marrying the two concepts faster than ever, tying the high-profile visuals of his political life to perfumes, watches, sneakers and digital trading cards. Everything around Mr. Trump has become something to monetize, including a moment of comity with Jill Biden, the first lady, at Notre-Dame over the weekend. “Here are my new Trump Perfumes & Colognes!” Mr. Trump wrote on social media on Sunday, along with a picture of his interaction with the faintly smiling first lady. “I call them Fight, Fight, Fight, because they represent us WINNING. Great Christmas gifts for the family.” Under the photo was another caption, an apparent dig at Dr. Biden: “A FRAGRANCE YOUR ENEMIES CAN’T RESIST!” Mr. Trump, in essence, used a civil moment with the first lady, a frequent critic, to sell fragrances that are “curated to capture the essence of success and determination,” according to the perfume website. Before Mr. Trump was first inaugurated, his sons moved totake over the family business, to at least create the perception of separation between a moneymaking enterprise and the highest office in the land. (Mr. Trump still maintained over 50 licensing deals in his name, according toan analysis by The Washington Post.) We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Hay poca información sobre de qué están hechos o dónde se fabrican. PorKatie Rogers Katie Rogers cubre la Casa Blanca y reportó desde Washington. Donald Trump aprendió hace mucho tiempo que las oportunidades de foto podían atraer la atención hacia él y que ponerle su nombre a cualquier cosa, desde rascacielos hasta filetes, podía hacerle ganar dinero. Como candidato a la presidencia por segunda vez y ahora presidente electo, está fusionando ambos conceptos más rápido que nunca, vinculando los elementos visuales de alto nivel de su vida política a perfumes, relojes, zapatos deportivos y tarjetas coleccionables digitales. Todo lo que rodea a Trump se ha convertido en algo que se puede monetizar, incluyendo un momento de cordialidad con Jill Biden, la primera dama, en la catedral de Notre Dame el fin de semana. “¡He aquí mis nuevos Perfumes y Colonias Trump!” escribió el presidente electo en redes sociales el fin de semana, junto a una foto de su interacción con la primera dama, que esbozaba una tenue sonrisa. “Los llamo Pelea, Pelea, Pelea, porque nos representan a nosotros GANANDO.

Rupert Murdoch Fails in Bid to Change Family Trust,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/media/rupert-lachlan-murdoch-family-trust.html,"Advertisement Supported by A Nevada commissioner ruled resoundingly against Mr. Murdoch, who was trying to give full control of his empire to his son Lachlan and lock in Fox News’s right-wing editorial slant. ByJonathan MahlerandJim Rutenberg A Nevada commissioner ruled resoundingly against Rupert Murdoch’s attempt to change his family’s trust to consolidate his eldest son Lachlan’s control of his media empire and lock in Fox News’s right-wing editorial slant, according to a sealed court document obtained by The New York Times. The commissioner, Edmund J. Gorman Jr., concluded in a decision filed on Saturday that the father and son, who is the head of Fox News and News Corp., had acted in “bad faith” in their effort to amend the irrevocable trust, which divides control of the company equally among Mr. Murdoch’s four oldest children — Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence — after his death. The ruling was at times scathing. At one point in his 96-page opinion, Mr. Gorman characterizes the plan to change the trust as a “carefully crafted charade” to “permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s executive roles” inside the empire “regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries” of the family trust. A lawyer for Mr. Murdoch, Adam Streisand, said Mr. Murdoch and Lachlan were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal. In a statement, James, Elisabeth and Prudence said: “We welcome Commissioner Gorman’s decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

TikTok Asks Court to Temporarily Freeze Sale-or-Ban Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/tiktok-temporary-pause-ban-supreme-court-trump.html,"TrumpInvestigations Advertisement Supported by The company is requesting a pause on a law that requires the app to be sold or face a ban in the United States by mid-January, aiming to buy time for the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration to rescue it. BySapna Maheshwari TikTok asked a federal court on Monday to temporarily freeze a law that requires its Chinese parent company to sell the app or face a ban in the United States, as it looked to the Supreme Court and the incoming Trump administration to rescue it. The company and a group of its userssuffered a blow on Friday, when judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously denied their petitions to overturn the law. TikTokaskedthe same court on Monday to temporarily block the law until the Supreme Court decided TikTok’s planned appeal of that decision. It isn’t clear whether the Supreme Court will agree to hear the case, though experts say it is likely. TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is facing new peril under the law that, citing national security concerns, calls on ByteDance to sell the app or face a ban on Jan. 19. TikTok, which boasts 170 million users in the United States, has said that a sale is impossible in part because of restrictions from the Chinese government and that a subsequent ban would violate the First Amendment rights of users. TikTok also suggested in its filing that the temporary freeze would give President-elect Donald J. Trump more time to try to rescue the app, as he has pledged to do. Right now, the ban would take effect a day before his inauguration. TikTok has asked the court to decide on the freeze by Dec. 16. The government has already pushed back on TikTok’s emergency request for the freeze, called an injunction. Lawyers for the Department of Justicesaid in a filingon Monday that the court should deny the request, and allow TikTok and its users to directly ask the Supreme Court for the injunction.

"After N.R.A.’s Supreme Court Win, a Dispute Over Key Facts",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/us/nra-supreme-court.html,"Supreme Court Advertisement Supported by The Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of the N.R.A. in May hinged on a secret meeting involving a New York regulator. The participants say it didn’t happen. ByDanny Hakim Danny Hakim has written about the N.R.A. since 2018. Earlier this year, the sharply divided Supreme Court came together to decide unanimously in favor of the National Rifle Association. The N.R.A., the justices ruled, could pursue its claim that a New York State regulator had infringed on its First Amendment rights when she sought to discourage insurers and banks from doing business with the gun group after the 2018 school massacre in Parkland, Fla. The ruling was a coup for the N.R.A., mired in years of litigation, scandal and deepening financial woes. The gun group’s lawyer called it “a landmark victory for the N.R.A. and all who care about our First Amendment freedom,” while its board president wrote in a recent internal letter that “the N.R.A. is poised to collect nearly $100 million in damages."" There is, however, a new wrinkle: The two women said to be the primary participants in a secret meeting described in the N.R.A. complaint, and pivotal to the Supreme Court ruling, say it never took place. While the veracity of the allegations has no bearing on the Supreme Court ruling, several legal experts said it could become a steep hurdle as the N.R.A.’s lawsuit makes its way back through the lower courts. The case before the high court was a test of how far government advocacy could go before crossing a line into coercion. The court’s opinion, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, said that while government officials could share “views freely and criticize particular beliefs,” they could not “use the power of the state to punish or suppress disfavored expression.” The ruling drew on an account of the supposed secret meeting, detailed in the N.R.A.’s lawsuit, between Maria T. Vullo, New York’s top financial regulator at the time, and Inga Beale, then chief executive of Lloyd’s of London, as well as a Lloyd’s lawyer. In the opinion’s third paragraph, Justice Sotomayor wrote that “Vullo met with senior executives at Lloyd’s” on Feb. 27, 2018, and “expressed her views in favor of gun control.” Further, Ms. Vullo was said to have told the Lloyd’s chief that if the insurer “ceased providing insurance to gun groups, especially the N.R.A.,” regulators would become “less interested” in pursuing regulatory infractions involving Lloyd’s. But in interviews and emails, both Ms. Vullo and Ms. Beale told The New York Times that they first met several months after the purported meeting, and then only at an industry awards luncheon where they exchanged pleasantries.

ByJohnny Diaz The U.S. Labor Department is investigating allegations that migrant children have worked at a meal preparation delivery facility in Illinois that is a subsidiary of the popular meal kit company HelloFresh, the company and federal regulators said. At least six teenagers, including some from Guatemala, worked night shifts at the facility, Cristobal Cavazos, the executive director for Immigrant Solidarity,an immigrant rights advocacy groupthat helped report the claims to federal regulators, toldABC News, which reported on the investigation. “They’re minors working dangerous jobs,” Mr. Cavazos told ABC News, which reported that the children were working there as recently as last summer. In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for the Labor Department confirmed an investigation into HelloFresh and a temporary staffing agency, Midway Staffing. The spokesman declined to comment further, citing the open investigation. It was not clear what kind of jobs the minors had at the facility. The claims relate to a Factor75 facility in Aurora, Ill., according to a HelloFresh spokeswoman who said the company learned of the claims from the Labor Department. In 2020,HelloFresh acquiredFactor75, which provides ready-to-eat meals to customers. In a statement on Sunday, the HelloFresh spokeswoman said: “We were deeply troubled to learn of the allegations made against a former temporary staffing agency, Midway Staffing.

China’s Critical Minerals Embargo Is Even Tougher Than Expected,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/china-critical-minerals.html,"Advertisement Supported by Beijing ordered companies around the world not to allow critical minerals mined in China to reach the U.S., while deepening its efforts to replace imports with domestic products. ByKeith Bradsher Reporting from Beijing and Shanghai Alarm is rising among multinational companies doing business with China about Beijing’s decision last week to order atrade embargoon the export of four critical minerals to the United States. The central subject of concern is a provision extending the ban to companies in other countries that transfer minerals to American firms after acquiring them from China. The order is the first time China has included a broad ban on so-called transshipment in a government regulation on exports. It also underlines Beijing’s readiness to escalate its tit-for-tat response to the tougher trade policies promised by President-elect Donald J. Trump. China has long condemned attempts by other countries, particularly the United States, to impose similar limits on transshipment by companies outside their borders. The ban by Beijing threatens to divide global supply chains further, by forcing companies to choose whether products with certain materials and components can be supplied only to the American market or only to the Chinese market. China has been trying to persuade companies elsewhere, particularly in Europe, that they should invest and build supply chains in China, not the United States. “The move marks a significant escalation of the ongoing tech war between the U.S. and China, and E.U. businesses are increasingly worried about being caught in the crossfire,” said Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.

PorKeith Bradsher Reportando desde Pekín y Shanghái. La semana pasada, Pekín decidió imponer unembargo comerciala la exportación de cuatro minerales críticos a Estados Unidos, lo que genera una creciente alarma entre las empresas multinacionales que hacen negocios con China. El principal motivo de preocupación es una disposición que amplía la prohibición a las empresas de otros países que transfieran minerales a empresas estadounidenses tras adquirirlos en China.

También subraya la disposición de Pekín a intensificar su respuesta de “ojo por ojo” a las políticas comerciales más duras prometidas por el presidente electo Donald Trump. Desde hace tiempo, China ha condenado los intentos de otros países, en particular Estados Unidos, de imponer límites similares a los transbordos de empresas fuera de sus fronteras. La prohibición de Pekín amenaza con dividir aún más las cadenas de suministro mundiales, al obligar a las empresas a elegir si los productos con determinados materiales y componentes pueden suministrarse solo al mercado estadounidense o solo al mercado chino.

Matea Gold Named Washington Editor of The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/media/matea-gold-washington-editor-times.html,"Advertisement Supported by Ms. Gold, a managing editor at The Washington Post, is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from the paper. ByBenjamin MullinandKatie Robertson Matea Gold, a managing editor at The Washington Post who until recently was a contender for the newspaper’s top editing role, is joining The New York Times as a senior editor in its Washington bureau. Ms. Gold will be Washington editor for The Times, reporting to its newly appointed Washington bureau chief, Dick Stevenson, the company said on Monday. She starts in January. Since September 2023, Ms. Gold, 50, has been a managing editor overseeing The Post’s political, local and investigative coverage. She was previously the newspaper’s national editor, leading a staff of 150 journalists. Ms. Gold joined The Post more than a decade ago from The Los Angeles Times and has served in a variety of roles, covering politics as a reporter and shepherding ambitious political investigations. Under Ms. Gold’s supervision, The Post’s national staff contributed to Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Post’s national staff also won a Pulitzer for a feature article on the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and end the constitutionally protected right to abortion. Her departure is the latest in a series of high-profile exits from the Post news and opinion departments in recent months. The newsroom has been in turmoil since Will Lewis, the company’s chief executive, abruptly forced out the paper’s top editor,Sally Buzbee, in June. Matt Murray, the former top editor of The Wall Street Journal, has led the newsroom on an interim basis since then. Several journalists from the opinion section stepped down from their positions after Jeff Bezos, the paper’s owner, decided shortly before the U.S. presidential election that the paper wouldnot endorse a candidate for president. The Post is searching for a permanent top editor for its news department. Ms. Gold had been considered a candidate for executive editor of The Post, according to two people familiar with the search process. Other candidates include Clifford Levy, a former deputy managing editor of The Times and now the deputy publisher of Wirecutter, The Times’s product recommendation site, and The Athletic, its sports site, the people said. Mr. Murray is also a candidate, the people said. One of the final hurdles is an interview with Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, who weighs in on hiring decisions for top positions. Ms. Gold joins The Times amid changes in the top ranks of its Washington bureau. The Times announced in November that Elisabeth Bumiller, who had led the bureau since 2015, would be stepping down from that role and returning to reporting. Mr. Stevenson, who has worked at The Times in various reporting and editing jobs for nearly 40 years, will be taking over for her in January. An earlier version of this article misstated the month when Matea Gold started as a managing editor at The Washington Post. It was in September 2023, not May.

"Trump Gives Powell a Reprieve, but Pledges Big Moves Elsewhere",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/dealbook/trump-powell-fed-tariffs-immigration.html,"Advertisement Newsletter The president-elect said he would not try to replace the Federal Reserve chair, but would seek to cut immigration, impose tariffs and more. ByAndrew Ross SorkinRavi MattuBernhard WarnerSarah KesslerMichael J. de la MercedandLauren Hirsch President-elect Donald Trump used hisfirst broadcast interviewsince the election to promise a fast-moving and disruptive administration that could shake up American and global business, including raising tariffs and cutting immigration. But for all the talk of breaking things, Trump told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he wouldn’t follow through with some of the moves that markets have feared, including trying to fire or undermine Jay Powell, the Fed chair. “No, I don’t think so,”Trump told NBC’s Kristen Welker aboutseeking to remove Powellbefore his term ends in May 2026. That said, the president-elect wasn’t exactly clear in all his comments: “I think if I told him to, he would,” Trump said of asking him to go, before adding, “But if I asked him to, he probably wouldn’t.” For the record, Powell has said hedoesn’t think the president has the legal authorityto dismiss him and that he wouldn’t leave if asked. At theDealBook Summitlast week, the Fed chair also said that he expected to have a “fine” relationship with Scott Bessent, Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary, who had floated naming a sort of shadow Fed chair. Other things Trump said he wouldn’t do:raise the age for Social Security or Medicare, or cut them as part of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s government-efficiency initiatives. He also said he wouldn’t limit access to abortion pills, and said he’d work with Democrats to avoid deporting the roughly 700,000 immigrants known as Dreamers. But he said he still plans to do a lot: Trump said he would impose sweeping tariffs, despite warnings that it could undercut his pledge to bolster the economy. That said, he admitted that he “can’t guarantee” that American families won’t pay more if they’re brought about. He also promised to end birthright citizenship, the provision in the Constitution guaranteeing American citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. (How that would happen outside of a constitutional amendment is unclear and would meet legal challenges in any case.) Trump also said that while he wouldn’t personally order the prosecution of perceived political enemies including Liz Cheney, he expected his administration to take up such cases. And he suggested that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, would examine adebunked link between vaccines and autism. Trump expects business leaders to go along for the ride.He told Welker that he’s having dinner with Jeff Bezos, the Amazon executive chair and founder of Blue Origin, a rocket company. (Bezos told Andrew at the DealBook Summit that he’s “very optimistic” about a second Trump administration.) We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Two Major Ad Agencies to Merge, Creating Global Giant",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/omnicom-interpublic-merger.html,"Advertisement Supported by If successful, Omnicom and Interpublic would become the largest advertising company in the world, with more than $25 billion in combined revenue. ByErin GriffithandDanielle Kaye Omnicom Group, one of the world’s largest advertising agencies, said on Monday that ithad agreed to acquire Interpublic Group, a large rival. If successful, the all-stock takeover would create the biggest ad agency in the world, with more than 100,000 employees and some $25 billion in annual revenue. The deal comes after years of transformation and disruption for the advertising industry, as digital ads overtook analog advertising channels and tech giants including Meta and Alphabet, the respective parent companies of Facebook and Google, moved further into the territory once dominated by traditional agencies. The tech and consulting giant Accenture has also made a big push onto the agencies’ turf, acquiring dozens of creative studios and related companies. The “Big Four” ad companies — Omnicom, Interpublic, WPP and Publicis — adapted by remaking themselves into digital technology companies, often through acquisitions. John Wren, the chief executive of Omnicom, said in a statement that the acquisition of Interpublic would “harness the significant opportunities created by new technologies in this era of exponential change.” Under the deal, which Omnicom said it expected to close in the second half of 2025, Omnicom shareholders would own about 60 percent of the combined company, with Interpublic shareholders holding the rest. Omnicom executives said they had “clearly identified opportunities” for $750 million in annual cost savings. The combined company would keep the Omnicom name.

China Opens Investigation Into Nvidia Over Potential Antitrust Violations,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/technology/china-nvidia-investigation-antitrust-ai.html,"ArtificialIntelligence Advertisement Supported by The move by Chinese regulators came a week after the Biden administration expanded curbs on the sale of advanced U.S. technology to China. ByMeaghan TobinJohn LiuAna SwansonandTripp Mickle Meaghan Tobin reported from Taipei, John Liu from Seoul, Ana Swanson from Washington and Tripp Mickle from San Francisco. China’s antimonopoly regulator announced on Monday that it was investigating potential violations of antitrust law by Nvidia, the American company that makesa vast majorityof the computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems. The inquiry, a rare move by Beijing, comes a week after the Biden administration expanded curbs on the sale of advanced American technology to China. In the days since, the Chinese government announced that it wouldban the exportof several rare minerals to the United States and imposed sanctions on more than a dozen U.S. defense firms and defense industry executives. Together, the moves by Beijing signal its willingness to engage insupply chain warfareas the policy contest over trade and the control of technology escalates between the world’s two largest economies. The battle has made A.I. chips into one of the world’s most sought-after technologies, and Nvidia has cornered the market, accounting for 90 percent of global sales by the end of last year. Nvidia’s dominance helped it become one of the most valuable companies in the world over the past year. Graham Webster, an academic focused on geopolitics and technology at Stanford University, said China had a variety of tools it could use to go after foreign companies and show its opposition to U.S. policy. “Nvidia is a pretty obvious target,” he added. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said on Monday that it was investigating Nvidia for violating commitments made during its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a company that makes computer networking equipment. The Chinese regulator approved Nvidia’s acquisition of the company in 2020 with conditions to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure supplies to China.

Dries Van Noten Names a New Dries Van Noten,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/style/dries-van-noten-new-designer-julian-klausner.html,"Advertisement Supported by Julian Klausner, who has been head of its women’s studio, is stepping into the founder’s shoes. ByVanessa Friedman A new creative power structure in fashion is beginning to emerge. On Monday, five months after Dries Van Noten (the man) shocked the style world byretiring, Dries Van Noten (the brand) named Julian Klausner as its new creative director, elevating a longtime member of the design team to the top post. Mr. Klausner will be in charge of both women’s and men’s wear for the house, which is known for its relaxed silhouettes and dramatic mélanges of colors and prints. He will be one of eight designers making their debuts at global brands in 2025, an unprecedented number and one that signals a potential reshaping of the industry at a time when numerous luxury labels are in creative upheaval, the industry is struggling with slowing consumer sales, andgossiparound who might be going where has reached a fever pitch. The choice of an insider to run what Dries Van Noten’s owner, the Spanish group Puig, called in its2023 annual reportits “fastest-growing niche brand,” is a vote in favor of continuity rather than statement-making surprise. Mr. Klausner, a 33-year-old Belgian who joined Dries Van Noten in 2018, two years after receiving a master’s degree from the fashion program at La Cambre, a visual arts school in Brussels, is relatively unknown beyond the walls of its Antwerp headquarters. He does not have either a significant Instagram or TikTok presence, and there are no photographs of him online cozying up to celebrities. What he does have, from his time as head of the brand’s women’s studio, is relationships with the design team and the confidence of the brand’s founder. “Julian’s understanding of the brand’s heritage, forged through his years with Dries, makes him uniquely suited for this role,” said Marc Puig, chief executive of the group. “His deep knowledge of the brand’s values has been cultivated over time, allowing for a thoughtful transfer of creative vision that both preserves Dries’ essence and pushes it forward.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

China Eases Overall Monetary Policy Stance for First Time in 14 Years,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/china-monetary-policy.html,"China’sEconomy Advertisement Supported by Faced with a faltering economy and falling prices, the Politburo loosened the policy approach of China’s central bank and called for “extraordinary” measures. ByKeith Bradsher Reporting from Shanghai China’s ruling Politburo loosened the country’s overall monetary policy on Monday for the first time in 14 years, the latest in a series of measures aimed at recharging economic growth and stopping a broad decline in prices. In a statement, the Politburo said that it would embrace a “moderately loose” policy, shifting away from a longstanding “prudent” stance — a signal that the country’s central bank will be more willing to reduce interest rates in the coming year. It also means the central bank may be more open to commercial banks holding smaller reserves while extending more and larger loans. The Politburo also called for a more proactive fiscal policy, which means that the government will be more willing to increase its own spending. It further suggested that the government would “strengthen extraordinary countercyclical measures,” an indication that the authorities may plan further steps to halt the erosion in economic growth rates. The Politburo said that it was approving several measures at the same time in order to deliver a policy “combination punch” to address China’s economic challenges. Taken together, the steps announced on Monday amounted to a rare public acknowledgment that Beijing needed to a take a stronger hand in addressing the country’s economic weakness. The Politburo’s announcements came ahead of the annual Central Economic Work Conference on Wednesday and Thursday, when the Chinese Communist Party and the cabinet set the country’s economic agenda for the upcoming year.

Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour Grand Total: A Record $2 Billion,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/arts/music/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticket-sales.html,"Advertisement Supported by Over 21 months, the pop superstar’s culture-dominating stage show doubled the gross of its closest competitor, according to ticket sales figures confirmed for the first time. ByBen Sisario For the last 21 months, Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour has been the biggest thing in music — a phenomenon that has engulfed pop culture, dominated news coverage andboosted local economiesaround the world. Now we know exactly how big. Through its 149th and final show, which took placein Vancouver, British Columbia, on Sunday, Swift’s tour sold a total of $2,077,618,725 in tickets. That’s two billion and change — double the gross ticket sales of any other concert tour in history and an extraordinary new benchmark for a white-hot international concert business. Those figures were confirmed to The New York Times for the first time by Taylor Swift Touring, the singer’s production company. While the financial details of the Eras Tour have been a subject of constant industry speculation since tickets were first offered more than two years ago — through a presale so in-demand it crashed Ticketmaster’s system — Swift has never authorized disclosure of the tour’s numbers until now. The official results are not far from the estimates that trade journalists and industry analysts have been crunching for months. But they solidify the enormous scale of Swift’s accomplishment. Just a few months ago, Billboard magazine reported thatColdplayhad set an industry record with $1 billion in ticket sales for its 156-date Music of the Spheres World Tour — a figure that is just half of Swift’s total for a similar stretch of shows in stadiums and arenas. Every date on the Eras Tour was sold out, and spare tickets were scalped at eye-popping prices — ortraded within the protective Swiftie fan community, often at face value. According to Swift’s touring company, a total of 10,168,008 people attended the concerts, which means that, on average, each seat went for about $204. That is well above the industry average of $131 for the top 100 tours around the world in 2023, according to Pollstar, a trade publication. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Cerca de 10 millones de personas asistieron a los conciertos. PorBen Sisario Durante los últimos 21 meses, la gira Eras Tour de Taylor Swift ha sido el suceso más grande de la música, un fenómeno que ha engullido la cultura pop, dominado la cobertura informativa eimpulsado economías localesde todo el mundo. Ahora sabemos exactamente qué tan grande. Hasta su último concierto, el número 149 de la gira, que tuvo lugarel domingo en Vancouver, Columbia Británica, la gira de Swift vendió un total de 2.077.618.725 de dólares en entradas. Eso son dos mil millones y pico, el doble de las ventas brutas de entradas de cualquier otra gira de conciertos en la historia y un nuevo y extraordinario punto de referencia para un negocio internacional de conciertos que está al rojo vivo. Taylor Swift Touring, la productora de la cantante, confirmó por primera vez estas cifras a The New York Times. Aunque los detalles financieros del Eras Tour han sido objeto de constante especulación en el sector desde que se ofrecieron las entradas por primera vez hace más de dos años —mediante una preventa con tanta demanda que colapsó el sistema de Ticketmaster—, Swift nunca había autorizado la divulgación de las cifras de la gira hasta ahora. Los resultados oficiales no distan mucho de las estimaciones que los periodistas especializados y los analistas del sector llevan meses calculando. Pero consolidan la enorme magnitud del logro de Swift. Hace apenas unos meses, la revista Billboard informó queColdplayhabía roto un récord en el sector con la venta de 1000 millones de dólares en entradas para su gira mundial Music of the Spheres, de 156 fechas, una cifra que es solo la mitad del total de Swift en una serie similar de conciertos en estadios y arenas. Todas las fechas del Eras Tour se agotaron, y las entradas sobrantes se revendieron a precios exorbitantes ose intercambiaron en la protectora comunidad de fans de Swift, a menudo a su valor nominal.

The Figure Skater Who Treats the Rink as a Runway,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/style/madison-chock-figure-skating-costumes.html,"Advertisement Supported by Madison Chock has earned a reputation for ice dancing in costumes as dazzling as her performances. ByMisty White Sidell The Chrysler Building. Salvador Dalí. Billie Eilish. Aliens. All have inspired costumes worn by the figure skater Madison Chock, who is known not only for intricate twizzles and lifts but also for competing in ensembles that have raised the bar for fashion in her sport. Almost all of her costumes over the last two decades have been designed by Ms. Chock herself. On Saturday, she andher skating partner and husband, Evan Bates, won their second consecutive gold medal for ice dancing at the Grand Prix Final competition in Grenoble, France. For their jazzy free dance routine, Ms. Chock wore a shimmering geometric costume that she said had taken inspiration from theChrysler Buildingand other Art Deco architecture. “Figure skating has so much room for fashion,” said Ms. Chock, who often looks to runway shows by high fashion labels like Schiaparelli and Mugler as inspiration for her ensembles. “I am very passionate about design, and I’m in a sport that’s unique because we have an ability to combine creativity with athleticism.” Ice dancing is typically performed in pairs, and unlike figure skating, it does not involve jumping. Instead, top duos like Ms. Chock and Mr. Bates — who are five-time U.S. national champions andOlympic gold medalists— incorporate highly technical footwork patterns and aerial lifts into programs choreographed like ballroom dances.

How Covid Can Change Your Gut,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/well/eat/covid-symptoms-diarrhea-constipation-pain-bloating.html,"Covid-19Guidance Advertisement Supported by Diarrhea, constipation, pain, bloating: We asked experts why the virus causes these issues and what to do about them. ByAlice Callahan Food used to be a daily source of joy for Sarah Carter. A self-described “vegetable head” in San Mateo, Calif., she loved perusing farmers’ markets, tending her garden, cooking elaborate meals and exploring Bay Area restaurants. That changed in October 2023, when Ms. Carter, 36, had Covid for the first time. Her main symptom, diarrhea, became so relentless that she had to take an ambulance to the emergency room. Her blood pressure and heart rate spiked from severe dehydration, and she needed intravenous fluids to treat it. She was sent home and endured three more days of diarrhea before she finally felt like herself again. That is, until April 2024, when she felt as if she “inherited a new GI system overnight,” she said. Nearly everything she ate, even bland foods like applesauce and toast, set off diarrhea. She also has had bloating and pain so severe she sometimes feels as if acid is running through her intestines. In May, a gastroenterologist diagnosed Ms. Carter with post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. It’s a common disorder that results in symptoms of I.B.S. — abdominal pain along with diarrhea, constipation or both — after food poisoning or other gastrointestinal illnesses. Her doctor said that her coronavirus infection six months earlier was most likely the cause. Gastroenterologists say that since the start of the pandemic in 2020, they have noticed anuptick in I.B.S.and other painful and often puzzling gut conditions like Ms. Carter’s, with many seeming to have been caused by previous coronavirus infections. We don’t have good estimates for what percentage of people with Covid go on to develop persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, but some limited and small studies suggest they can bebetween 16and40 percent. Gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting and diarrheaare common during the initial stages of a coronavirus infection, said Dr. William D. Chey, a gastroenterologist at Michigan Medicine. But for some people,these and other symptoms, like reflux, constipation, pain and bloating, can stick around for months or even years. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The Couple Living and Working in a Holiday ‘Emerald City’,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/realestate/eerdmans-gallery-greenwich-village-christmas.html,"Each year, Emily Eerdmans, a design historian, and her husband, Andrew McKeon, an environmentalist, transform their rented Manhattan duplex apartment into a freewheeling holiday bazaar. The chandelier’s blinking disco bulbs cast colored light on a 13-foot Christmas tree and metallic balloons in the parlor gallery of Eerdmans Fine Art, in Greenwich Village.Credit... Supported by ByCraig Kellogg Photographs byAshok Sinha A decade ago, Emily Eerdmans and her husband, Andrew McKeon, were living in a rented Brooklyn Heights garden apartment with low ceilings. They both worked from home: His office was very small, with a door. Her office was the ivory damask sofa in the living room — a perch she described as the “ideal backdrop for my needlepoint pillow collection.” Just before her 40th birthday, Ms. Eerdmans, a design historian, decided she needed her own space “to make money.” She saw a New York Times real estate advertisement for a windowed basement office at 14 East 10th Street, an 1839 townhouse in Greenwich Village. For the next five years, she commuted to her gallery, Eerdmans Fine Art, from the apartment in Brooklyn. Customers ducked under the stoop to enter, the bathroom was freshly renovated and the landlady lived like a modernist on the patrician parlor floor right upstairs. The landlady died and a year later, in the summer of 2020, Ms. Eerdmans began to envision a live-work duplex. Fortunately, Mr. McKeon, too, could look past the many sloppy coats of paint and see the potential of the sublime neoclassical architecture. “Even in that glopity-glop state, you couldn’t miss the beauty,” he said. He agreed to give up their Brooklyn apartment to afford the extra rent on 10th Street. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Why Not Tell Someone They Look Great Today?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/style/compliments.html,"Advertisement Supported by Don’t underestimate the simple power of complimenting a stranger. BySadie Stein Sadie Stein is an editor on the Books desk. She was inspired to write this article after telling a stranger that she loved her outfit. One Monday morning a couple of weeks ago, I was riding the downtown local train to work when I noticed a woman slightly farther down the car in a perfect outfit. It wasn’t that there was anything showy about it — if memory serves, she wore green trousers, a button-down shirt, Mary Janes and a cropped tweed jacket — but the proportions wereperfect. The ensemble had clearly been put together with thought and care. I chose my moment — two stops from my destination, in case things got awkward — and made my move. “Excuse me,” I said. She looked appropriately wary. “I just have to say: I love your whole look.” She was flattered. We talked briefly about her excellent hobo bag. When I returned to my seat, the woman next to me said, “Your saying that to her inspired me to tell you: I’ve been admiringyouroutfit!” Maybe not what most people think of as a New York moment, but it has become one for many this fall. The compliment market is booming. “Oh, there’s definitely been an uptick,” saidKaitlin Phillips, a publicist in Manhattan. She said she had been complimented on her outfits at random four times in one week, despite that she was “not a style maven.” “There’s definitely more lately,” says Kristin Roa, 33, a dancer based in Manhattan. After getting a new short haircut, Ms. Roa was feeling a bit unsure about it. But not for too long: “Today I was complimented not once but twice on my hair — all before 10 a.m.!” she said. “They both caught me off guard but were very appreciated.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A.D.H.D. Diagnoses Are Surging Among Older Americans,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/well/mind/adhd-diagnosis-older-middle-age.html,"Advertisement Supported by Many say they are relieved to finally have an explanation after decades of struggle. ByChristina Caron Over her life, Tanya Murphy had become accustomed to hiding her depression. In the Christian social circles in Georgia where she raised her three children, this was the rule — not the exception, she said. “God forbid you have a mental health issue,” said Ms. Murphy, 56, who now lives in Arlington, Va. “And if you do? Girl, all you have to do is fast and pray.” But by the time she reached her late 40s, she knew she couldn’t mask her problems any longer. Ms. Murphy had developed anxiety and started having thoughts of ending her life. She knew she was smart but she didn’t feel that way. Her difficulty focusing — as a child, her teachers called her a daydreamer — had translated into spending thousands of dollars on entrepreneurial projects that she later lost interest in and abandoned. After researching her symptoms online, Ms. Murphy realized that she might have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D., a neurodevelopmental disorder that typically involves inattention, disorganization, hyperactivity and impulsivity. She was finally diagnosed, at age 53, by a psychiatric nurse practitioner. After she began taking the non-stimulant A.D.H.D. medication Strattera, attending regular therapy sessions and meditating, her ability to focus improved and the anxiety and the depression faded away. “I cried with joy,” she said. “I knew that I wasn’t crazy. I knew that I wasn’t broken. I wasn’t a failure. I wasn’t lazy like I had been told for most of my life. I wasn’t stupid.” Over the last 20 years, clinicians have increasingly recognized that A.D.H.D. symptoms, which begin in childhood, can linger into adulthood, and that some groups — likewomenandpeople of color— are more likely to be underdiagnosed early in life. Now, with the rise of telemedicine, increased awareness of A.D.H.D. andchanging attitudesabout mental health treatment, new A.D.H.D. diagnoses are surging among older Americans.

These Nuns Were Excommunicated but Won’t Leave Their Convents,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/realestate/spain-nuns-convents-poor-clares-of-belorado.html,"Advertisement Supported by The Poor Clares of Belorado, in northern Spain, are digging in their heels in a battle of wills over real estate with the Catholic Church. ByRachel Chaundler One afternoon this past summer, a car sped out of the gates of a convent on the outskirts of a sleepy village in northern Spain and kept going until it reached another convent 85 miles away. Behind the wheel was a nun. In the passenger’s seat was another nun. They sprinted in the white Nissan along a country road lined with sunflower fields and wooden telegraph poles — desperate to save the way of life of their order, the Poor Clares of Belorado, which has been around since 1358, and to retain control of their three convents. The Vatican had excommunicated the sisters and a local archbishop had threatened them with eviction because they had broken with the Roman Catholic Church. And though the Poor Clares of Belorado own two of the buildings they live in and had recently signed an agreement to buy a third, the Vatican had appointed a local archbishop to administer their properties and finances. The frenzied car trip came after the nuns heard that the archbishop was planning to seize spare keys from janitors and change the locks on two of the convents. “They drove like fury,” said Sister María Belén de la Trinidad, 51.  By the time the two nuns reached the convent called the Derio, the lock on the front door had been changed and the other doors bolted from the inside. The nuns found an open back door, sneaked in and regained access. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

In the days since, afterLuigi Mangionewas identified and charged in the murder of the UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, it has been impossible to escape his photo. Or photos. They are proliferating. They are on television, in the newspaper and all over social media. Not just pictures of Mr. Mangione from his booking at a police station in Altoona, Pa., or his mug shots in prison orange, but photos of him in earlier times, in a navy blazer, crisp white shirt and tie. Images of him hiking shirtless in the hills. In all of them, he is clean-shaven, curly-haired, often flashing a bright, white grin. Even his Tinder profile has made it into the public, with more pics featuring his six-pack. One commentatorcomparedthe stream of pictures to “an endless photo shoot.” And with them have come the comments. The swooning. The fan cams. “If the guy is fit, you must acquit,” went one post on X. “He’s even hotter with his mask and shirt off,” went another. Indeed, it didn’t take long for Mr. Mangione to be popularly christened “the hot assassin.” Even before a suspect had been named, much was written about the killer’s elevation tofolk herostatus. He was cast in the role of what the historian Eric Hobsbawm called the “social bandit” — one man seeming to take a stand against an unfair system. Then, once Mr. Mangione had been accused of shooting and killing Mr. Thompson, what forensic psychologists call the “halo effect” came into play. The official term for the tendency of the public to equate innocence with attractiveness, the halo effect when combined with the social bandit phenomenon creates a combustible pop-culture archetype — one beloved by mythmakers and Hollywood and rooted deep in the general psyche. You get Robin Hood, as played by Russell Crowe. Jesse James, as played by Brad Pitt (not to mention Colin Farrell, Rob Lowe and Tyrone Power). Butch and Sundance, the Paul Newman-Robert Redford version. You get the thirsty, soft-focus take on the criminal and the bloody revolutionary. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Read Your Way Around Chicago,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/books/chicago-books-rebecca-makkai.html,"What to Read Advertisement Supported by Chicago is a city of bookish abundance, home to countless literary giants past and present. The author Rebecca Makkai recommends works that capture its spirit. ByRebecca Makkai Read Your Way Around the Worldis a series exploring the globe through books. Chicago is too big, enormous in both geography and spirit, to capture in its entirety. Locals understand this. If you find a book set in a nonspecific “Chicago” — a book purporting to take the whole place as its subject, or one that assumes downtown is the entire ethos — you know it was written by someone who only visits. To write well about Chicago is usually to write about specific blocks, buildings or ethnic enclaves. This is the DNA of Chicago literature: neighborhood as subject, neighborhood as map of the heart. Of course, what makes a neighborhood isn’t just the people and the map, but history. And Chicago is somewhat unique in its evident layers of time. In no other city of this size and grandeur would the one-story hardware store that’s only open on Wednesdays or the record store that sells 10 LPs a week survive into 2024. It’s possible here to turn a certain corner and forget that it’s not 1973, or 1952, or 1899. Chicago literature, too, tends to take the city’s past as part of its present. If you’re visiting in person or through books, you’d do well to read your way not only into every neighborhood, but into every era of the city. Plenty of Chicago reading lists begin and end with the first half of the 20th century, and while I don’t love that, you could do worse than to start with this heady time when the city, in the wake of 1871’s Great Fire, was busy reinventing itself and self-mythologizing. You can start your old-school deep dive with Theodore Dreiser’s“Sister Carrie,”a 1900 realist novel about a Wisconsin girl who comes to Chicago and gets mixed up with everything from acting to robbery. Next, try Carl Sandburg’s“Chicago Poems,”the collection that contains “Chicago” — the one about the “Hog Butcher for the World … Stormy, husky, brawling, / City of the Big Shoulders.” Sandburg first published the poem in 1914, in Chicago’s own Poetry magazine, founded two years earlier by Harriet Monroe.

A Local’s Guide to Celebrating the Holidays in New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/travel/christmas-holiday-nyc-guide.html,"Facing crushing throngs and high prices can be as off-putting as a rock-hard bagel. Here’s how New Yorkers enjoy their hometown’s seasonal traditions without much challenge to their patience or pocketbook. Among the commercial buildings celebrating the holidays this year with creative decor is the Louis Vuitton flagship store. Its entire facade is “gift-wrapped” in the brand’s signature travel trunks.Credit...Katherine Marks for The New York Times Supported by ByJulie Besonen In December, New Yorkers like to indulge in frothy hot chocolate and other traditional Yuletide treats as much as the city’s holiday visitors do, but facing crushing throngs and high prices, particularly at home, can be as off-putting as a rock-hard bagel. Locals have learned some hacks to enjoy New York’s holiday hoopla hassle-free. From visiting perennial favorites off-hours to holiday shopping off the beaten path, here’s how residents and visitors alike can celebrate Christmastime in the city with a minimum of stress. While the well-known, over-the-top light show at Saks wascanceledthis year, other New York retailers have continued the tradition of lavishly decorating their windows and buildings to celebrate the holidays. The display windows atBergdorf Goodmanare always wildly creative, and this year’s lights are inspired by the200th anniversary of the official openingof Fifth Avenue. One tableau dramatizes the New York Public Library, cramming together madcap likenesses of typewriters, famous writers and the main building’s iconic marble lions. To avoid a jostling wall of heads blocking your view, go early in the morning or near midnight (same for viewing the always mobbed tree in Rockefeller Center). Also worth viewing this year: the Louis Vuitton flagship store, at 57th Street.Its entire facade is “gift-wrapped” in the brand’s signature travel trunks, stupefyingly stacked to the sky.

The Grandpa Shoe Goes Hype,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/style/mephisto-grandpa-shoes.html,"Advertisement Supported by With a zesty collaboration arriving this week, the French shoemaker Mephisto is suddenly something it never dreamed of being before: cool. ByJacob Gallagher Since Brian Procell first chanced upon Mephisto’s wide-set sneakers at his local suburban New Jersey mall in the 1990s, he has been smitten by the shoes. “I’ve traversed the globes in Mephistos,” said Mr. Procell, a grand poobah of New York’svintage scene. The sneakers are light on branding, sophisticated like a leather club chair and, to him, ideal for world travel. “Tokyo, French flea markets, they’ve been everywhere,” he said. Those are more cosmopolitan settings than the common (though clichéd) environments where Mephistos tend to appear: carpeted condos and retirement homes. The brand’s shoppers have traditionally been more AARP than Gen Z. During a visit last month to Mephisto’s shop in midtown Manhattan, a pool of gray-haired shoppers confirmed the brand’s renown with the 60-and-up set. Mr. Procell is not nearly that old, but he has heeded the footwear wisdom of his elders. Mephistos are “for the geriatric community, and why is that?” he asked, “Because they’re built well and they’re easy on your feet.” So smitten is he that last year, Mr. Procell reached out to Mephisto to make his own version of its archetypical Match model. The company bit, and tomorrow a collaborative version of its blocky Match sneaker, in a preppy British shade of racing green, will be released exclusively at the Procell downtown Manhattan boutique. There, the shoe of grandparents everywhere will be on offer, wedged between racks of endangered Chanel, faded tennis tees and blisteringly rare Stone Island slickers. That is, while stock lasts. The suede-and-leather shoes are rarer than nearly all Jordans. Just 100 pairs were produced. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

A Palestinian Winemaker Carries On,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/dining/drinks/palestinian-winemaker.html,"The Pour In the West Bank, Sari Khoury is trying to resurrect ancient traditions with grapes that reflect “the prehistory of modern winemaking.” Sari Khoury makes wine near Bethlehem in the West Bank, where he is exploring indigenous grapes and the region’s ancient winemaking traditions.Credit...Afif Amireh for The New York Times Supported by ByEric Asimov Sari Khoury, the proprietor ofPhilokaliain the West Bank, would prefer to speak of the craft of winemaking and the ancient winemaking history of Palestinians rather than of the precarious circumstances he must currently navigate simply to get his work done. Mr. Khoury was one of the very few winemakers working in the region before the Oct. 7 attacks on Israelis by Hamas and the subsequent war in Gaza, about 45 miles to the southwest. And his work, creating excellent natural wines, has continued through the war. Winemaking is not widely practiced today in the West Bank, though Mr. Khoury cited one other producer near Bethlehem,Cremisan Winery, which has been making wine since 1885 and is run by the Salesians of St. John Bosco, a Roman Catholic order. Since the war in Gaza began, Israel has intensified raids and arrests of Palestinians across the West Bank in what it describes as a campaign against terrorism. Mr. Khoury, who works in the West Bank, lives in Beit Hanina, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Goingback and forth to the vines he tends near Bethlehemis tricky because it is separated from Jerusalem by a wall and several checkpoints. “Checkpoints are not predictable,” he said. “Sometimes it’s 45 minutes, sometimes two hours, especially exiting the West Bank.” Throughout history, in times of conflict, farmers and winemakers have tried to carry on as best they can.In Lebanon, where Israel has been fighting Hezbollah, Israeli airstrikes across the south and in the Bekaa Valley, prime winemaking regions, have made these areas hazardous to farm. Yet the wine growers continue, just as they did through 15 years of civil war in the 1970s and ’80s. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Traveling to the U.K. Soon? You Might Need to Apply and Pay a Fee First.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/travel/uk-eta-visa.html,"Advertisement Supported by As of Jan. 8, an electronic travel authorization will be required for visitors from dozens of visa-exempt countries, including the United States and Canada. ByChristine Chung Travelers from the United States, Canada and dozens of other countries who do not require visas to enter the United Kingdom will soon need to apply for digital authorization in order to visit or transit through the country. Theelectronic travel authorization, called ETA and linked to a traveler’s passport, costs 10 pounds, or around $13, and lasts two years. The requirement was introduced about a year ago for nationals of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and four other Gulf nations and will extend to more than 40 visa-exempt countries starting Jan. 8. It will eventually apply to all visa-exempt travelers wishing to visit the United Kingdom, including those from the European Union. Travelers connecting through airports in the United Kingdom who have final destinations elsewhere will also need to apply for ETA, though this policy is currently under review. The ETA system is part of a mission to “deliver a more streamlined, digital immigration system” that will enhance border security, according to anews releasefrom the British Home Office. Here’s what you need to know about ETA and the process to apply. The ETA is for short-term visits under six months and only for visa-exempt travelers; thefull listof applicable nationalities is available online. The ETA does not replaceexisting visa policies, which require citizens of dozens of countries and territories to apply for and receive a visa to enter the United Kingdom. British and Irish citizens, visa holders, and those granted permission to live, work or study in the United Kingdom do not need to apply for the ETA.

"In ‘Our Town,’ the Characters Are Fictional. The Bacon Is Real.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/dining/broadway-our-town-smells.html,"Backstage at the Broadway play, they’re frying up the aroma of breakfast — part of a long tradition of adding scents to plays and movies. Meghan Abel, the head of the Barrymore Theater’s prop department, cooks bacon offstage to provide an aromatic effect for “Our Town” on Broadway. She often dons this costume for the weekly meals where cast and crew eat the bacon in BLTs.Credit...Jonah Rosenberg for The New York Times Supported by ByErik Piepenburg The curtain had just come down on a recent Wednesday matinee of the Broadway revival of “Our Town,” Thornton Wilder’s 1938 play set in a small New Hampshire town. But cast and crew members were already in the basement of the Ethel Barrymore Theater, lining up to assemble BLTs. The fixings were arrayed on a table: hot bacon, romaine hearts and tomato slices, white toast, mayonnaise (traditional and vegan) and, for iconoclasts, honey mustard and avocado. There were noisy debates about whether crispy or chewy bacon makes a superior sandwich. There was consensus on one matter. “What’s better than bacon?” barked Julie Halston, one of the show’s 28 actors. “Nothing.” This was not a catered meal or a special occasion. It was a BLT Wednesday, and the bacon had been fried up in the wings, just steps away from the actors as they performed the play’s final stretch. To add a sense memory, two pounds of bacon are fried at every performance. Kenny Leon, who directed the show, said he was inspired by David Cromer’s 2009 Off Broadwayrevivalof “Our Town,” whichfeatured the onstage cooking of baconduring the same third-act scene, when the ghost of Emily, a leading character, visits her childhood home at breakfast time.

ByDani BlumandEmily Schmall Friends of the 26-year-old charged with killing the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare have said he was dealing with back issues that led to sometimes debilitating pain. The idea that a back injury might disrupt a young man’s life is no surprise to doctors who treat people in pain every day. “Their lives are just kind of turned upside down,” said Dr. Jacob Joseph, a neurosurgeon at University of Michigan Health specializing in spine injuries. Roughly16 million adultsin the United States experience persistent back pain that gets in the way of daily activities. Back pain is among themost common medical problemsin the country. It is also theleading cause of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The suspect in the killing, Luigi Mangione,posted multiple timesin a Reddit community dedicated to discussions about spondylolisthesis, a sometimes painful condition that occurs when a vertebra in the spine slips out of alignment. He wrote that his “spondy went bad” when he was 23 and said he had undergone spinal fusion surgery in July 2023. He also described other ongoing health issues, including brain fog. Experts interviewed for this story spoke only broadly about back pain. The current status of Mr. Mangione’s health, including his back issues, is not clear.

Please Let Me Love My Wife,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/style/modern-love-please-let-me-love-my-wife.html,"Advertisement Supported by Modern Love Her pronouns changed. Our bond didn’t. ByRebecca Collins Jordan Our story never failed to charm at cocktail parties. We were college sweethearts addicted to one another’s company, pen pals while abroad, intellectual soul mates who moved together from Montana to Manhattan, goofy newlyweds who never stopped rooting for each other. This is the story I love to tell, and this story is true. But these days, a few drinks in, people learn that my partner’s pronouns have changed since the wedding — to she/her instead of he/him — and I watch their eyes fill with concern. “So how old did you say you were when you got married?” they ask. “Right, 24, yeah, that’s young.” After which they never mention my marriage again. Others react in vaguely supportive ways at first, only to pounce weeks later. “How’s your home life?” they might ask if I casually mention stress or fatigue. Everywhere I turn, people want to mother or therapize me. They corner me in bars, after dinner, in a quiet hallway at a party. They need me to know that they only desire my happiness. They just can’t imagine, they say, what they would do if this happened to them. They tell me I’m beautiful, intelligent and so kind. They want to know if I’m truly happy. I have spent the last two years, since Kaci started coming out to ever-widening circles, trying to figure out how to respond to these interventions. I have come to expect them once I’m alone in a room with someone. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

For 22 years, Steve has been my tough, motorcycle-riding, dog-loving neighbor. He knows my life’s chaos — a broken heart, elder care, house repairs — and takes it upon himself to look out for me. This Christmas, he noticed my undecorated house. “You don’t have lights,” he declared matter-of-factly. Bypassing my protests about effort, waste and aesthetics, he admitted that he had already bought me some, then proceeded to string bright, mismatched bulbs across my porch. They’re not my style, but they’re unmistakably Steve: bold, unapologetic, full of heart. Sometimes love is letting someone’s unsolicited care light up your life. —Aimee Norman After much nudging, I go to the Marriott with co-workers for drinks. Leaving early, I hear the doorman ask, “Can I call you a cab?” I respond like a smartass, saying, “My taxi is the 6 train to the Bronx.” He laughs, then gives me his business card. I give him mine, thinking nothing of it. I completely forget about our exchange. Two days later, he calls me at my office asking me on a date. I agree, and now our 15-year-old son takes the 6 train to our home in the Bronx. —Janet Vasquez At 53, atop Florence’s Ponte Vecchio bridge, I proposed and my “manpanion” accepted. In Chicago, I realized I needed to come out to my father. Across a kitchen table for two, I blurted out, “I asked Michael to marry me.” Dad responded, “That’s great. Congratulations.” Seconds passed. Rewinding 40 years in my mind, I asked, “It’s OK?” My father, Irish Catholic from a small farming community, sat up straighter, held my gaze and said, “No one else gets a say. It’s good for the two of you.” When we wed, Poppy sat in the front pew. We miss him daily. —Paul James Hickey “The two of you are sickening,” my son asserts. “He knows he can get away with anything because you’ll forgive him.” “He’s my man,” I say, and my 24-year-old son shakes his head in disgust, grumbling, “I don’t even know what that means.” “He” is Ruairi, a young flame-point Siamese cat who is completely self-interested yet readily offers kisses. I adore him and he knows it. Single for years, I had believed that I was over unhealthy relationship behavior patterns.

Love now and always. Did you fall in love last night? Just tell her I love her. Love is stronger than anything you can feel. For the love. Love. And I love you more than anything. (SINGING) What is love? Here’s to love. Love. From “The New York Times,” I’m Anna Martin. This is “Modern Love.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Are you ready to go? I’m ready to go. OK. Let’s do it. Today I’m talking to my colleague, Eli Tan. Thanks for having me on. Eli is a reporter at “The Times.” He’s 26. He lives in San Francisco, and he’s single. That means Eli, like nearly every other single person I know, is on the dating apps. And also, just like every other single person I know, Eli thinks the dating apps are awful. He told me every conversation he has feels exactly the same. Honestly, it feels like this liminal interaction that you can have a dozen times a day where it’s always the same type of thing. And no one ever remembers the conversation they have with someone on a dating app. You never continue that in the real world. No. It’s kind of this weird, performative interaction that you do just to get to the next step. Do you feel trapped by these apps? Like, do you feel like it’s the only way that you can meet people? In a lot of ways, I do, yeah. I think I’ve looked at the data of how many relationships after college start on dating apps nowadays, and it’s like the vast majority or something. So in a lot of ways, it feels like it’s something that everyone is doing. But also, if it’s possible, if we could all just stop going on dating apps, we would. [LAUGHS]: But — It’s so true. Yeah. — it’s kind of like how people feel addicted to social media, and they say, I wish that nobody was on it, because then I wouldn’t feel a need to be on it. Completely. And that’s how I feel about dating apps. I mean, I’ve spent years on dating apps. And at one point, I went and I actually listened to the Hinge founder’s — he went on podcasts and talked about, well, here are the best ways to make your profile. What did he say? He just said — He’s like, have a photo with friends. I’m like, I know. It was very data-driven. He said, OK, this many of the relationships start when you have a fun prompt. And you always want to be responding to prompts. You don’t want to be just — Ugh! — sending likes out into the ether. And I said, OK. If I’m going to be on these apps, I might as well have an approach that would work. It’s so easy to get fatigued with swiping and talking that I thought, oh, if there’s a data-driven way to make this better, I should try to do it and see how it works. [MUSIC PLAYING] The thing is that data-driven approach didn’t really work for Eli. He optimized his profile, chose the best discussion prompts he could, the best photos. And he was going on more dates, sure, but he couldn’t find anyone he really connected with. But then Eli learned about a new kind of dating app, apps that promised to solve his problems using AI. So Eli signed up. He made AI clones of himself that could go on hundreds of virtual dates. And he used AI dating coaches to help him flirt, kind of be his wingman. I’ve never heard of someone dating like this, ever. So that’s what we’re talking about today. What happened when Eli handed over control of his dating life to AI, and whether this technology can solve our dating woes? Stick with us. OK, Eli, you are here to talk about dating using AI. And I guess I’m curious, in the broadest sense, why would someone do that? Why introduce AI into our dating life? So the problem, I think, it’s trying to solve is that talking to people and matching with people on dating apps can be this tedious and time consuming thing. And the idea is that if you clone yourself as an AI and the AI can take care of that initial conversation when you’re kind of feeling out if you might like someone or not, then it can save you time. And then if you have so many of these dates, the best one or two are going to be with somebody that’s really compatible. So in that way, it can save you time as well. In my case, I had my clone — it was going on hundreds of dates a week, which is more than I would ever be able to go on by myself. I can usually, at most, probably manage one date a week. I have so many questions about everything you just said. But before we do that, I just want to make something really clear. You weren’t just using a demo or something here. These were real apps that were made to help people use AI in their dating lives. And you actually did this making a real profile, using your real name, your real photos, earnestly trying to meet someone. Were you nervous for that? Not really. I think I was more curious. [LAUGHS]: Not at all? Well, what’s the worst that can happen? Not really, no. Oh, my — I mean, I thought it might be kind of weird or a little bit dystopian, people tell me. But personally, I was more just curious, and I thought the whole thing was kind of a humorous thing to try. Oh, really? Oh, my gosh. Yeah. I’d be really scared. I’d be really nervous. I just feel like — I don’t know. I would not do an experiment with my actual love life. And I’m the one that hosts a podcast about love. Like, I would feel very nervous about doing that. I don’t know — maybe that’s ego? It’s cool to me that you were just purely curious about it. Yeah, some of it’s probably that dating apps can be so frustrating anyways. You’re like, let’s just blow it up and see. Yeah, why not? How much worse can things get? I’ll make a clone of myself and date that way. Why not? Let’s try it. Why not? OK, I want to get into the specifics here. When it comes to the cloning apps, what apps were you using, and what did they do? So for the cloning apps, I used one app called Ice, which let me create a clone that could then talk to real people. And then I used another app called Volar, which let me create clones that talked to other people’s clones. Break that down for me. You’re trying to duplicate your personality in an AI clone. What does that look like? How are you training this computer model? Well, each of these clones had their own chat bot that would essentially be like my brain. So I would basically be texting these clones like I would a close friend so that they could pick up on my cadence and — Your mannerisms. — the things that I’m interested in. The clones would ask me what I’m looking for in a relationship and try to feel that out so that when it went out there itself into the dating pool, it could act just like me. And can I ask you, what types of questions, the specific questions it was asking you and how you responded? Yeah, it would be the typical dating interest. So like, oh, what do you like to do on the weekends? What are you looking for in a relationship? What are your love languages? Uh-huh. And what did you say you were looking for? What type of relationships you’ve been in. For the purposes of this, I said, yeah, I’m looking for a serious relationship. I’m looking for a serious partner. Mm-hmm. And what did you say you liked to do on the weekends? I’m just trying to get a sense of, I guess, you, but really your clone. So that’s where it got difficult because it can be difficult to put your personality into text like that. Totally. It’s like, hang out with friends and chat. Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]. And then at the end of the day, we’re all similar because everyone likes to go out and eat at restaurants and hang out at parks. And work out, yeah. Yeah, and then there was one particular thing I had a really difficult time, which was trying to explain to my clone that I like the outdoors, and I like nature, but I don’t actually really go in the outdoors much, and I don’t really go hiking. So my clone would always tell people that, oh, I went on this hike this weekend, and I did this, and I had to explain to it like, no, I say I like those things, but I’ve never actually owned hiking shoes, you know? I don’t know any of these places you’re mentioning because I’m just more kind of the idea of being an outdoorsy person, those type of things that seemed intuitive to me. Your clone’s like, and I just got back from climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, and you’re like — Exactly. — we need to roll that back. And I’m like — I walked up a hill. — yeah, I didn’t do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to clarify, do these clones hook into existing dating apps that we have, like Hinge and Tinder? Or are they on separate apps? So the clone apps are separate apps. OK. From what I understand, a lot of these really popular dating apps are working on creating their own clones, but that’s all internal for now. So I used basically smaller apps that are — yeah, they’re their own thing. So you log on to them, and you have your own profile. And they don’t connect to places like Hinge — Gotcha. — Tinder. You log on to them. You train the clone. Like you said, you upload the photos. And you’re texting it and telling it about what you enjoy. And it’s picking up on your cadence. And so you train up this clone that then goes out and has conversations with who? So the clones would have conversations with other people’s clones. So at the end of every day, I would get a notification that said, your clone went on 100 dates today. Check and see how they went. And I could go through — Oh, my god. — and I could look at these long conversations that these two clones would have together. And if I wanted to, I could say, OK, I think this worked out really well. I think there’s something here. I can manually enter. And then our clones become humans, and we talk that way. So you’d open up your phone after just doing other things during the day, doing your job, hanging out with real people in the world, and you log on to this app and it would say, your clone has gone on 100 dates, and you functionally read transcripts of these dates? Yeah. So I would get a notification that my clone had gone on 10 or 20 or 30 dates, and then I could go in and I could read back through those transcripts and see how they went. Did you ever log into your app and see them just chatting it up and feel like you were intruding? Yeah, if you were on the app, you could click on a conversation and see the messages go back and forth every few seconds if you wanted to. Ooh. And then I could say, oh, this person likes doing so-and-so, and, oh, they like going to this place. I do, too. But then the weird thing was seeing — it didn’t happen often, but moments of intimacy between two clones, where it really didn’t feel like it was me and another person. It felt like my clone was kind of its own thing. And what I found was that my clone really did have a personality of its own. Even if I tried to train it on certain things, it would enjoy going to its own restaurants and coffee shops and stuff like that. Can you give me an example of a moment of intimacy that you saw between your clone and someone else’s clone, if you can remember? It would be very brief, but it would be like after a long conversation, my clone would say something like, I really like you. And then the other clone would say, I like you, too, or something like that — OK, stop. — something very raw. How did real Eli feel reading clone Eli and clone Lisa having this moment of like, “I like you,” “I like you“? What did that feel like to you, reading the transcript of this clone conversation? It felt totally bizarre, and it felt like something that I was not involved in. And it didn’t make me want to jump in and take over. It felt like, oh, no, this is kind of its own thing happening. Interesting. And yeah, I didn’t do this. This is — Well, that was going to be my question. It’s like, in reading a transcript of a clone date that ostensibly went really well — they’re hitting it off — clone sparks are flying — are you then like, man, I want to get in this app and talk to real Lisa? It sounds like your answer to that is no. It’s almost so Uncanny Valley, or it feels separate from you. And it doesn’t make you actually want to get in touch with the real person behind that clone. Yeah, I would say that’s definitely true. Huh. I don’t know. If that were me and I was carrying my phone around all day, and I knew that inside my phone, my clone was going on hundreds of dates — [LAUGHS] It felt like this secret life I had in my phone, where — Totally. — I would look at the notification and look around, and I would say, no one even knows that my clone just went on 100 dates. [LAUGHS]: No one even knows that my clone’s a player. My clone is on its way to date all of San Francisco in one month. OK, how is that actually time-saving, though? Like, you open up the app, and it’s like, your clone went on 100 dates. Do they rank them in terms of compatibility, or do you need to read through basically 100 transcripts of dates? Because that does not feel quicker to me. Yeah, so this app did not rank them. But I’ve talked to people that work for dating app companies that say, oh, well, we can then manually run a program that will find the best three conversations. I mean, there’s an episode of “Black Mirror” that’s like this, where it’s like a futuristic dating app where people’s clones are trapped in this universe, and they have to find each other. Oh, yeah. And they have to find love. And I actually talked to a few different founders that told me straight up, they said, yeah, it was inspired by that episode to — Oh, my god. — create this app. And I thought, oh, wow, that’s interesting because that was like a dystopia. That wasn’t like a happy story. I would 100 percent say that. [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back, Eli and I do a dramatic reading of one of his clone’s conversations. You will not want to miss it. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, so you just told us about this way that clones can go on dates with other clones, but there’s another use of clones, AI clones and dating, correct? Yes, the other way that you can use clones and that I tried out was that you could go into another app, and you could look through a list of clones and people, and you could pick which one you wanted to talk to. And then I myself could have a conversation with the clone. So it’s you yourself, you, human, real Eli. Yes, human Eli could go into the app, and it could say, OK, look at 100 of these profiles of these people. Which one do I think I would be interested in or do I think is attractive? And I can click on that person, and I can just immediately enter a conversation with that person’s clone. So what is the problem-solve there? What’s the purpose? It’s not totally — I think the purpose would be that on the other end — Right. — you can see not only that somebody is interested in talking with you, but then you have, basically, this preemptive conversation. And you can see, oh, OK, what are they like? Yeah. So instead of having this pile of swipes or likes on a dating app that is two-dimensional, you now have this three-dimensional thing where you can see how you might have gotten along with this person or how your clone managed the conversation. And you get to see — Interesting. — a little bit more about them than you would just with photos. Yeah, there’s more evidence, almost, for potentially actually engaging with this human person as another human person. OK, so there’s this conversation that you include in the article you wrote about this experiment, Eli, where your clone is interacting with a real person. So it’s this kind of conversational dynamic we’re talking about. And I want to do something that will be fun, OK? I want to have us act out that conversation because I really think the listeners need to hear it in its full glory. So your clone is talking to this real person named Rachel. You are going to be your clone. I’m going to be Rachel. And we’re going to go for it. I need to get into character for a second. I’m going to embody Rachel. And I need you to put yourself in the space of being your clone. OK. You feel ready? I’m ready. OK. Go for it. If you could only eat one snack for the rest of your life, what would it be? Mozzarella sticks. Crunchy, cheesy bliss. [LAUGHS]: What is it about mozzarella sticks that make your heart skip a beat? Lol. It gives pizza vibes but with much more cheese. What’s your go-to? Expensive cheese and bread all the way. There’s something about the richness that makes my heart sing. What’s your fave pizza topping, by the way? Pepperoni. And what do you mean by expensive cheese? Pepperoni perfection. [LAUGHS]: OK, OK, OK. When you read this transcript again between your clone and this real person, Rachel, what’s your immediate thought? Oh, I was cringing. [LAUGHS]: I thought this was — I mean, I remember when I first read this conversation on the app — because it works OK when I’m messaging other people because I’m in control. Of course. But the horrifying part is then seeing all the things my clone was saying to people. So you’re saying you wouldn’t — I was just thinking, oh, my gosh, why would it say this? Crunchy, cheesy bliss? Followed by the pepperoni perfection. It was like too many catchphrases. Like, it was just too much. It’s really bad. I mean, it’s really bad. Are you like, what have I wrought? Like, what else are you thinking? Yeah, typically the reaction would be, OK, I need to fix something because you can train the clone when it makes mistakes. And you can kind of do pep talks with it and say, OK, we can’t talk like this anymore. We can’t be doing these catchphrases. Like, you tell the clone, all right, no more catchphrases. Or you don’t need to talk so much about cheese and food. And it’s OK to do other stuff. [LAUGHS]: But my reaction, it was like — yeah, it was like wanting to discipline this clone for — what if this person was someone that I really liked? And it was like — Well, what if you — — well, now it’s botched this opportunity — I was just — — and I could have maybe done it better myself. I was going to say, did that thought occur to you? Like, what if Rachel was a potential match, and then she heard “pepperoni perfection” from your clone, and she was like, I’m out? Like — I don’t know — that’s what I meant by, were you nervous to do this? Yeah, that was, I think, the part that took courage, was to say, OK, I’m just going to do it, even if it might torpedo this interaction. Or if I think I could actually salvage this, I’m just going to see if the clone can do it and can turn it around. Interesting. And in that way, it felt like it was a little bit out of my control. But with something like this, Rachel knew that she was talking to my clone. Yeah. So she probably had an understanding that, OK, this is not exactly how Eli talks — or hopefully not. I want to flip the script a bit. So that was your clone talking to a real person. When you were the real person talking to a clone, what was that like for you? Yeah, that wasn’t great either. I mean, what I ended up finding was that most people have the same four or five interests. And it can be kind of hard to animate that or to create any sense of chemistry. And a lot of the times, the things that make us who we are, they’re just very difficult to put down or to train a clone on. And what it helped me with was seeing what a person’s broad interests were and the things that they like to do and more of that biographical detail. But it didn’t help me at all realize if I had any chemistry with that person. So in that way, the clones have kind of an impossible task where even if they could perfectly replicate flirting and the way we talk to each other, it would only go so far, I think. Yeah. I wonder if this experiment taught you anything about the nature of conversations on dating apps, because listening to you talk, I’m wondering whether AI is involved or not, how is talking about our favorite foods supposed to help us build a connection with someone else? Like, maybe there’s just a problem with dating on an app, period, is that we’re talking about the wrong stuff. Yeah, but thinking a lot about that because I think when you go on an actual date, within the first few minutes, no matter what you’re really talking about, you can get a sense if you like that person or not. And for whatever reason, when you do that virtually over text, it’s just not the same, even if you’re talking about something that might be more realistic. There’s something about the in-person chemistry that’s not coming through. [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back, Eli tells us about a more promising way to use AI in dating. [MUSIC PLAYING] So, Eli, we talked about these AI clones of yourself that you made to go on all these virtual dates for you, but I know you also used an app called Amori that had these AI dating coaches. And these seemed to me like something I would actually use. I could not see myself cloning myself, but I honestly really could see myself popping over to my AI dating coach and being like, oh, what do you think about this situation? Or was the text I just sent totally freaking weird? Or how should I respond to this? Tell me about those dating coaches. Are they what I imagine them to be? Yes, the dating coaches, in one of the apps, they all had different personalities. So one of them was a wise aunt figure. Oh, my god. And one of them was like the bro best friend. And another one was Christie, the blunt bestie, who’s — she was the most popular on the app, I was told, by its founder — Duh. — because she was so sassy, and she would tell it like it is, you know? So, yeah, I could upload conversations that I’d have with somebody off of dating apps, whether it was texting on iMessages or whatever it was. And the clone or the dating coach would look at all the messages, and I could ask it questions about how the conversation was going. Like what kinds of questions? So I would ask, do you think this person’s interested in me romantically, or do you think it’s more of a friend situation? Yeah. And Christie would say, oh, I’m kind of — Christie’s blunt bestie? Christie, the blunt bestie. Right. She would say, oh, I’m kind of getting buddy vibes from this one. Oh, god. Or I think this one might — maybe we can spice it up. But right now, I think this is more just kind of a platonic thing. That’s so blunt bestie vibes. Is this an actual thing that you uploaded to Christie and she actually said that to you? Yes, yes. OK, and what was your emotional reaction when blunt bestie AI dating coach told you that? Like, a “aw“? One of the situations, I was like, I don’t know, Christie. I mean, I think there might be something there. So in one of the cases, I switched over to Ethan the wingman, which is one of the other coaches that I would use because he’s more of my bro. [LAUGHS]: And he’s always going to hype me up. Like, he’s never looking to shut things down. He’s always looking for solutions. Yeah. So I asked him — So you uploaded the same conversation and you said to Eli. Yeah, I uploaded the same conversation, and he was much more optimistic. I mean, he picked out specific things that she sent or said that he said, this could be really good. And who did you decide to believe — Christie, blunt bestie, or Ethan, your bro? In that case, I stuck with Ethan, my bro. But in a lot of the cases, it’s true. Christie, her feedback actually was pretty good. Can I just follow up? So Ethan said, like, go for it, man. There could be something here. There could be a spark. And so did you proceed with the conversation in that way? Did you try to see if there was something romantic there? And was Ethan right, basically, is my question. I think in that case, Ethan was probably more right. But I think it really more comes down to just looking at these conversations with optimism or being really cautious and safe. Huh. Which is what the two coaches represented, more than actually picking up on the specific things. Can I ask you, did anything come of that relationship? Did you guys end up going on a date, date? Uh, no, not with that person. OK, but Ethan was right that there was something a little more there, but it just didn’t pan out? I think so personally. My read was closer to how Ethan saw it than Christie. Copy that. All right, gotcha. When you were asking these dating coaches to generate a response to something someone had said to you on an app, would you disclose to the people on Hinge or whatever who were applying, would you tell them — you’d send them a message, and then would you say, like, and by the way, that was generated using AI? Would you disclose that to them? I would not disclose it to them in the moment. OK. But if I would go on a date with that person, I would tell them, and I would see what they thought about it — And what — — because that felt more honest than just living this — What did people think? — this lie. How did you say it? Like, and by the way, that cool line that drew you in, that was from the Rizzler or whatever. [LAUGHS] Well, I would always bring it up. I would try to do like a roundabout way to bring it up, where I said, oh, actually — ‘cause I saw you’re a journalist. What are you writing about? I’m actually writing about this dating app story where you can use AI to generate messages. And they’re like, that’s so weird. I would totally know if someone used that. And I’m like, well, could you tell that I actually used it for these few messages? And they would be like, oh, no, I didn’t. I didn’t know. Or they would say, oh, yeah, now that you say that, I can kind of tell. Yeah. But most people were pretty put off by the idea. I never met someone that was like, I’m going to try that myself. That never happened. Would you feel — I don’t know — a bit of a weight lifted off your shoulders when you finally disclose that you were using AI? Did it feel like you were admitting something? A little bit. Yeah. I wondered how it would reflect on me if it would make me seem either kind of dishonest or — Huh. — like I wasn’t super genuine because I was using this. I mean, in one case, this person that I’ve actually been on a few dates with, the AI actually came up with this inside joke that is still kind of a thing. And I have not disclosed that this actually wasn’t me that — Oh, my gosh. — created this. Well, Eli, are you going to, or it’s too late now? I mean, I guess she’ll hear this episode and then know that. But something like that, I just felt like, oh, this is weird. Is this something that’s coming from me, or is this kind of inorganic, though? Can we know what the joke is, or is that too — Yeah, I have some prompt on my Hinge profile about — it’s like, “I know the best —” these are all so silly already. It’s like, “I know the best place in town for —” and then you fill it in. I think I said something like dim sum. Nice. And she had asked about it. And I had been using this product kind of like ChatGPT. It’s called Claude. And Claude was actually a little bit funnier. It was like a little bit better with the banter, and its whole thing was that it wasn’t telling her what the place was. And it was just trying to do other stuff or telling her — Yeah, it was diverting. — oh, maybe if I trust you more, I can tell you. Funny. So — And you still haven’t told her — — that has kind of continued on. I’ve still never told this person about this dim sum place. Wait, I have to ask, are you still seeing this person? I am. Yeah, we’re getting dim sum on this week, actually. And I’m probably going to have to confess while I’m there that the AI came up with that dim sum restaurant. [LAUGHS]: You know what’s striking me about this sort of usage of AI and dating, like the showing of the conversations and asking for advice, I do that literally all of the time with just my friends, right? I’ve been talking to this person on and off, and I am basically sending screenshots of our entire conversation from start to finish, sending off like 65 images to the friend group chat, asking for feedback. Like, this is what I’m doing with my friends, and it strikes me like AI is kind of doing that, but worse? Possibly, yeah. I think one alternative way to look at that would be you can’t always berate your friends a dozen times a day, sending them screenshots about conversations. My friends love it. Your friends love it? [LAUGHS]: Yeah, my friends would probably, I think, get tired eventually if I was like, can you come up with another opener? OK, what about another? What about another? I see what you’re saying, yeah. If you’re trying to use this stuff en masse, the AI might make sense. So actually, at one point, I have a best friend who is very similar to Ethan, the wingman, in my life. And at one point, I was like, oh, I’ll send both of them screenshots and see the difference. Interesting. You put this to the test, the question I just asked you. I put it to the test. Yeah. Yeah, my friend in real life, his name is Ryan. But Ryan is not very good at dating apps. So I was like, well, I don’t know if any of this advice is going to be really great. I don’t have somebody that nails with the advice in real life about this stuff. I don’t have a group chat that can actually give me — You got to get yourself a blunt bestie, babe. I know. I do. I really need that in real life. That might help me out. Are you still using the AI? The story’s published. It came out. Are you still using these AI tools post-publish, or did you delete the clone apps from your phone the second that you were done with this story? I have not been using the clone apps. A couple of them actually shut down after I finished reporting this because they couldn’t raise more money, or they didn’t have very much success. Cheesy, crunchy bliss was just not making a lot? That was a killer for them. Something I still do, I still ask this ChatGPT service sometimes to recommend me date spots or things we can do or activities we can do in certain neighborhoods. Because at this point, the service actually knows me pretty well. We’ve talked enough about — Wow. — how dates go. And a lot of the times, it will actually give me really good recommendations. Well, help me make something of it. Right now, it sounds like, in some way, the clone version of you or the AI tools have embedded themselves into the way that you’re using these dating apps. Like, do you think this experience of reporting the story has fundamentally changed the way you’re approaching dating in your life and will approach dating? I think so. I think it has. And I think it’s changed the way that I see my profile. And when you animate some of the ways that you describe yourself on apps or put them into conversation, it’s like, oh, this actually comes off differently than maybe I thought it did. Huh. Maybe I will actually not market myself as much of an outdoorsy person because I’m not or something like that. Yeah, yeah. After all of this, what is your verdict? Is AI going to fix our dating woes, our app fatigue? I think my takeaway is less about, can AI solve my dating life, and more, do I want it to? There are some things that, yeah, maybe I can do this. But do I want to be automating out my relationships and my dating and these moments of first meeting somebody and having meetcutes? Like, why would I want a robot to do that? I think that’s just something that I want to do myself. And I got so many emails from readers that said, dude, just go — older readers that were 60, 70 years old that would say — What did they say? Wait, that’s so cute. They were saying, back in my day, I would just go out and I would just smile at women on the street. And if they smiled back, I would go up and talk to them. You should try that. And part of me is thinking like, OK, Glenn, it’s not 1970, and times have changed. It’s actually not OK to just go out and smile at a bunch of women. We actually have to be mo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e creative. And just generally, I think the dating advice of older generations is just so different than the experience. Like if I talk to my parents about dating, they would give me some advice like, oh, when you’re least expecting it, that’s when you’ll find love. And meanwhile, I’m like, trying to get my clone to date as many people in San Francisco as I can, you know? I’m like, my clone’s not really picking up my sense of humor that well. It’s like a totally separated — Your mom’s like, join a volleyball league. Yeah, my mom, I was talking to her on the phone yesterday. She’s like, maybe you should pick up a hobby that men also do, like woodworking. I was like, I’m not talking to you about this. Yeah, I mean, I guess, to that point, OK, so it sounds like you are committed or at least are seeking these kind of moments of serendipity and connection in real life. Are there ways that you are trying to cultivate that off the apps these days? I am, but it’s hard. Well, one, you can’t schedule serendipity. That’s true. I wish we could. It’s kind of counteractive. But yeah, I’ve tried — I think there’s this whole network now of these dating events that you can do because people are so frustrated with the apps. So they try to get people in person. And I mean, one of them, I tried one of these singles running clubs once. Oh, brother And I mean, I realized this as we started running. I’m like, I’m not a runner. Like — [LAUGHS]: — this is like a five-mile run. You’re like, time to go back to the clone. I am huffing and puffing. I’m like, I’m just making the good runners look even better because I’m not even trying to talk to someone. I’m just trying to get through this run. Right, right, right. So things like that where it’s like, OK, you really have to be extroverted, I think, to be going to some of these in-person events. And meeting people through friends of friends or whoever it is, is still probably, for me, the ideal way. But it’s just not something that you can — Schedule. — plan ahead or try to do a bunch of. It’s something that just happens naturally, I would say. [MUSIC PLAYING] Eli Tan, what a fun conversation. Thank you for joining me on the show today. Thanks so much for having me. What fun. What crunchy, cheesy bliss. We’re so grateful that you did this with us. No, thank you guys for having me on. This was — Oh, my god. — this was awesome. It was so much fun. Come back.

Just tell her I love her. Love is stronger than anything you can feel. For the love. Love. And I love you more than anything. (SINGING) What is love? Here’s to love. Love. From “The New York Times,” I’m Anna Martin. This is “Modern Love.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Are you ready to go? I’m ready to go. OK. Let’s do it. Today I’m talking to my colleague, Eli Tan. Thanks for having me on. Eli is a reporter at “The Times.” He’s 26. He lives in San Francisco, and he’s single. That means Eli, like nearly every other single person I know, is on the dating apps. And also, just like every other single person I know, Eli thinks the dating apps are awful. He told me every conversation he has feels exactly the same. Honestly, it feels like this liminal interaction that you can have a dozen times a day where it’s always the same type of thing. And no one ever remembers the conversation they have with someone on a dating app. You never continue that in the real world. No. It’s kind of this weird, performative interaction that you do just to get to the next step. Do you feel trapped by these apps? Like, do you feel like it’s the only way that you can meet people? In a lot of ways, I do, yeah. I think I’ve looked at the data of how many relationships after college start on dating apps nowadays, and it’s like the vast majority or something. So in a lot of ways, it feels like it’s something that everyone is doing. But also, if it’s possible, if we could all just stop going on dating apps, we would. [LAUGHS]: But — It’s so true. Yeah. — it’s kind of like how people feel addicted to social media, and they say, I wish that nobody was on it, because then I wouldn’t feel a need to be on it. Completely. And that’s how I feel about dating apps. I mean, I’ve spent years on dating apps. And at one point, I went and I actually listened to the Hinge founder’s — he went on podcasts and talked about, well, here are the best ways to make your profile. What did he say? He just said — He’s like, have a photo with friends. I’m like, I know. It was very data-driven. He said, OK, this many of the relationships start when you have a fun prompt. And you always want to be responding to prompts. You don’t want to be just — Ugh! — sending likes out into the ether. And I said, OK. If I’m going to be on these apps, I might as well have an approach that would work. It’s so easy to get fatigued with swiping and talking that I thought, oh, if there’s a data-driven way to make this better, I should try to do it and see how it works. [MUSIC PLAYING] The thing is that data-driven approach didn’t really work for Eli. He optimized his profile, chose the best discussion prompts he could, the best photos. And he was going on more dates, sure, but he couldn’t find anyone he really connected with. But then Eli learned about a new kind of dating app, apps that promised to solve his problems using AI. So Eli signed up. He made AI clones of himself that could go on hundreds of virtual dates. And he used AI dating coaches to help him flirt, kind of be his wingman. I’ve never heard of someone dating like this, ever. So that’s what we’re talking about today. What happened when Eli handed over control of his dating life to AI, and whether this technology can solve our dating woes? Stick with us. OK, Eli, you are here to talk about dating using AI. And I guess I’m curious, in the broadest sense, why would someone do that? Why introduce AI into our dating life? So the problem, I think, it’s trying to solve is that talking to people and matching with people on dating apps can be this tedious and time consuming thing. And the idea is that if you clone yourself as an AI and the AI can take care of that initial conversation when you’re kind of feeling out if you might like someone or not, then it can save you time. And then if you have so many of these dates, the best one or two are going to be with somebody that’s really compatible. So in that way, it can save you time as well. In my case, I had my clone — it was going on hundreds of dates a week, which is more than I would ever be able to go on by myself. I can usually, at most, probably manage one date a week. I have so many questions about everything you just said. But before we do that, I just want to make something really clear. You weren’t just using a demo or something here. These were real apps that were made to help people use AI in their dating lives. And you actually did this making a real profile, using your real name, your real photos, earnestly trying to meet someone. Were you nervous for that? Not really. I think I was more curious. [LAUGHS]: Not at all? Well, what’s the worst that can happen? Not really, no. Oh, my — I mean, I thought it might be kind of weird or a little bit dystopian, people tell me. But personally, I was more just curious, and I thought the whole thing was kind of a humorous thing to try. Oh, really? Oh, my gosh. Yeah. I’d be really scared. I’d be really nervous. I just feel like — I don’t know. I would not do an experiment with my actual love life. And I’m the one that hosts a podcast about love. Like, I would feel very nervous about doing that. I don’t know — maybe that’s ego? It’s cool to me that you were just purely curious about it. Yeah, some of it’s probably that dating apps can be so frustrating anyways. You’re like, let’s just blow it up and see. Yeah, why not? How much worse can things get? I’ll make a clone of myself and date that way. Why not? Let’s try it. Why not? OK, I want to get into the specifics here. When it comes to the cloning apps, what apps were you using, and what did they do? So for the cloning apps, I used one app called Ice, which let me create a clone that could then talk to real people. And then I used another app called Volar, which let me create clones that talked to other people’s clones. Break that down for me. You’re trying to duplicate your personality in an AI clone. What does that look like? How are you training this computer model? Well, each of these clones had their own chat bot that would essentially be like my brain. So I would basically be texting these clones like I would a close friend so that they could pick up on my cadence and — Your mannerisms. — the things that I’m interested in. The clones would ask me what I’m looking for in a relationship and try to feel that out so that when it went out there itself into the dating pool, it could act just like me. And can I ask you, what types of questions, the specific questions it was asking you and how you responded? Yeah, it would be the typical dating interest. So like, oh, what do you like to do on the weekends? What are you looking for in a relationship? What are your love languages? Uh-huh. And what did you say you were looking for? What type of relationships you’ve been in. For the purposes of this, I said, yeah, I’m looking for a serious relationship. I’m looking for a serious partner. Mm-hmm. And what did you say you liked to do on the weekends? I’m just trying to get a sense of, I guess, you, but really your clone. So that’s where it got difficult because it can be difficult to put your personality into text like that. Totally. It’s like, hang out with friends and chat. Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]. And then at the end of the day, we’re all similar because everyone likes to go out and eat at restaurants and hang out at parks. And work out, yeah. Yeah, and then there was one particular thing I had a really difficult time, which was trying to explain to my clone that I like the outdoors, and I like nature, but I don’t actually really go in the outdoors much, and I don’t really go hiking. So my clone would always tell people that, oh, I went on this hike this weekend, and I did this, and I had to explain to it like, no, I say I like those things, but I’ve never actually owned hiking shoes, you know? I don’t know any of these places you’re mentioning because I’m just more kind of the idea of being an outdoorsy person, those type of things that seemed intuitive to me. Your clone’s like, and I just got back from climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, and you’re like — Exactly. — we need to roll that back. And I’m like — I walked up a hill. — yeah, I didn’t do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to clarify, do these clones hook into existing dating apps that we have, like Hinge and Tinder? Or are they on separate apps? So the clone apps are separate apps. OK. From what I understand, a lot of these really popular dating apps are working on creating their own clones, but that’s all internal for now. So I used basically smaller apps that are — yeah, they’re their own thing. So you log on to them, and you have your own profile. And they don’t connect to places like Hinge — Gotcha. — Tinder. You log on to them. You train the clone. Like you said, you upload the photos. And you’re texting it and telling it about what you enjoy. And it’s picking up on your cadence. And so you train up this clone that then goes out and has conversations with who? So the clones would have conversations with other people’s clones. So at the end of every day, I would get a notification that said, your clone went on 100 dates today. Check and see how they went. And I could go through — Oh, my god. — and I could look at these long conversations that these two clones would have together. And if I wanted to, I could say, OK, I think this worked out really well. I think there’s something here. I can manually enter. And then our clones become humans, and we talk that way. So you’d open up your phone after just doing other things during the day, doing your job, hanging out with real people in the world, and you log on to this app and it would say, your clone has gone on 100 dates, and you functionally read transcripts of these dates? Yeah. So I would get a notification that my clone had gone on 10 or 20 or 30 dates, and then I could go in and I could read back through those transcripts and see how they went. Did you ever log into your app and see them just chatting it up and feel like you were intruding? Yeah, if you were on the app, you could click on a conversation and see the messages go back and forth every few seconds if you wanted to. Ooh. And then I could say, oh, this person likes doing so-and-so, and, oh, they like going to this place. I do, too. But then the weird thing was seeing — it didn’t happen often, but moments of intimacy between two clones, where it really didn’t feel like it was me and another person. It felt like my clone was kind of its own thing. And what I found was that my clone really did have a personality of its own. Even if I tried to train it on certain things, it would enjoy going to its own restaurants and coffee shops and stuff like that. Can you give me an example of a moment of intimacy that you saw between your clone and someone else’s clone, if you can remember? It would be very brief, but it would be like after a long conversation, my clone would say something like, I really like you. And then the other clone would say, I like you, too, or something like that — OK, stop. — something very raw. How did real Eli feel reading clone Eli and clone Lisa having this moment of like, “I like you,” “I like you“? What did that feel like to you, reading the transcript of this clone conversation? It felt totally bizarre, and it felt like something that I was not involved in. And it didn’t make me want to jump in and take over. It felt like, oh, no, this is kind of its own thing happening. Interesting. And yeah, I didn’t do this. This is — Well, that was going to be my question. It’s like, in reading a transcript of a clone date that ostensibly went really well — they’re hitting it off — clone sparks are flying — are you then like, man, I want to get in this app and talk to real Lisa? It sounds like your answer to that is no. It’s almost so Uncanny Valley, or it feels separate from you. And it doesn’t make you actually want to get in touch with the real person behind that clone. Yeah, I would say that’s definitely true. Huh. I don’t know. If that were me and I was carrying my phone around all day, and I knew that inside my phone, my clone was going on hundreds of dates — [LAUGHS] It felt like this secret life I had in my phone, where — Totally. — I would look at the notification and look around, and I would say, no one even knows that my clone just went on 100 dates. [LAUGHS]: No one even knows that my clone’s a player. My clone is on its way to date all of San Francisco in one month. OK, how is that actually time-saving, though? Like, you open up the app, and it’s like, your clone went on 100 dates. Do they rank them in terms of compatibility, or do you need to read through basically 100 transcripts of dates? Because that does not feel quicker to me. Yeah, so this app did not rank them. But I’ve talked to people that work for dating app companies that say, oh, well, we can then manually run a program that will find the best three conversations. I mean, there’s an episode of “Black Mirror” that’s like this, where it’s like a futuristic dating app where people’s clones are trapped in this universe, and they have to find each other. Oh, yeah. And they have to find love. And I actually talked to a few different founders that told me straight up, they said, yeah, it was inspired by that episode to — Oh, my god. — create this app. And I thought, oh, wow, that’s interesting because that was like a dystopia. That wasn’t like a happy story. I would 100 percent say that. [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back, Eli and I do a dramatic reading of one of his clone’s conversations. You will not want to miss it. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, so you just told us about this way that clones can go on dates with other clones, but there’s another use of clones, AI clones and dating, correct? Yes, the other way that you can use clones and that I tried out was that you could go into another app, and you could look through a list of clones and people, and you could pick which one you wanted to talk to. And then I myself could have a conversation with the clone. So it’s you yourself, you, human, real Eli. Yes, human Eli could go into the app, and it could say, OK, look at 100 of these profiles of these people. Which one do I think I would be interested in or do I think is attractive? And I can click on that person, and I can just immediately enter a conversation with that person’s clone. So what is the problem-solve there? What’s the purpose? It’s not totally — I think the purpose would be that on the other end — Right. — you can see not only that somebody is interested in talking with you, but then you have, basically, this preemptive conversation. And you can see, oh, OK, what are they like? Yeah. So instead of having this pile of swipes or likes on a dating app that is two-dimensional, you now have this three-dimensional thing where you can see how you might have gotten along with this person or how your clone managed the conversation. And you get to see — Interesting. — a little bit more about them than you would just with photos. Yeah, there’s more evidence, almost, for potentially actually engaging with this human person as another human person. OK, so there’s this conversation that you include in the article you wrote about this experiment, Eli, where your clone is interacting with a real person. So it’s this kind of conversational dynamic we’re talking about. And I want to do something that will be fun, OK? I want to have us act out that conversation because I really think the listeners need to hear it in its full glory. So your clone is talking to this real person named Rachel. You are going to be your clone. I’m going to be Rachel. And we’re going to go for it. I need to get into character for a second. I’m going to embody Rachel. And I need you to put yourself in the space of being your clone. OK. You feel ready? I’m ready. OK. Go for it. If you could only eat one snack for the rest of your life, what would it be? Mozzarella sticks. Crunchy, cheesy bliss. [LAUGHS]: What is it about mozzarella sticks that make your heart skip a beat? Lol. It gives pizza vibes but with much more cheese. What’s your go-to? Expensive cheese and bread all the way. There’s something about the richness that makes my heart sing. What’s your fave pizza topping, by the way? Pepperoni. And what do you mean by expensive cheese? Pepperoni perfection. [LAUGHS]: OK, OK, OK. When you read this transcript again between your clone and this real person, Rachel, what’s your immediate thought? Oh, I was cringing. [LAUGHS]: I thought this was — I mean, I remember when I first read this conversation on the app — because it works OK when I’m messaging other people because I’m in control. Of course. But the horrifying part is then seeing all the things my clone was saying to people. So you’re saying you wouldn’t — I was just thinking, oh, my gosh, why would it say this? Crunchy, cheesy bliss? Followed by the pepperoni perfection. It was like too many catchphrases. Like, it was just too much. It’s really bad. I mean, it’s really bad. Are you like, what have I wrought? Like, what else are you thinking? Yeah, typically the reaction would be, OK, I need to fix something because you can train the clone when it makes mistakes. And you can kind of do pep talks with it and say, OK, we can’t talk like this anymore. We can’t be doing these catchphrases. Like, you tell the clone, all right, no more catchphrases. Or you don’t need to talk so much about cheese and food. And it’s OK to do other stuff. [LAUGHS]: But my reaction, it was like — yeah, it was like wanting to discipline this clone for — what if this person was someone that I really liked? And it was like — Well, what if you — — well, now it’s botched this opportunity — I was just — — and I could have maybe done it better myself. I was going to say, did that thought occur to you? Like, what if Rachel was a potential match, and then she heard “pepperoni perfection” from your clone, and she was like, I’m out? Like — I don’t know — that’s what I meant by, were you nervous to do this? Yeah, that was, I think, the part that took courage, was to say, OK, I’m just going to do it, even if it might torpedo this interaction. Or if I think I could actually salvage this, I’m just going to see if the clone can do it and can turn it around. Interesting. And in that way, it felt like it was a little bit out of my control. But with something like this, Rachel knew that she was talking to my clone. Yeah. So she probably had an understanding that, OK, this is not exactly how Eli talks — or hopefully not. I want to flip the script a bit. So that was your clone talking to a real person. When you were the real person talking to a clone, what was that like for you? Yeah, that wasn’t great either. I mean, what I ended up finding was that most people have the same four or five interests. And it can be kind of hard to animate that or to create any sense of chemistry. And a lot of the times, the things that make us who we are, they’re just very difficult to put down or to train a clone on. And what it helped me with was seeing what a person’s broad interests were and the things that they like to do and more of that biographical detail. But it didn’t help me at all realize if I had any chemistry with that person. So in that way, the clones have kind of an impossible task where even if they could perfectly replicate flirting and the way we talk to each other, it would only go so far, I think. Yeah. I wonder if this experiment taught you anything about the nature of conversations on dating apps, because listening to you talk, I’m wondering whether AI is involved or not, how is talking about our favorite foods supposed to help us build a connection with someone else? Like, maybe there’s just a problem with dating on an app, period, is that we’re talking about the wrong stuff. Yeah, but thinking a lot about that because I think when you go on an actual date, within the first few minutes, no matter what you’re really talking about, you can get a sense if you like that person or not. And for whatever reason, when you do that virtually over text, it’s just not the same, even if you’re talking about something that might be more realistic. There’s something about the in-person chemistry that’s not coming through. [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back, Eli tells us about a more promising way to use AI in dating. [MUSIC PLAYING] So, Eli, we talked about these AI clones of yourself that you made to go on all these virtual dates for you, but I know you also used an app called Amori that had these AI dating coaches. And these seemed to me like something I would actually use. I could not see myself cloning myself, but I honestly really could see myself popping over to my AI dating coach and being like, oh, what do you think about this situation? Or was the text I just sent totally freaking weird? Or how should I respond to this? Tell me about those dating coaches. Are they what I imagine them to be? Yes, the dating coaches, in one of the apps, they all had different personalities. So one of them was a wise aunt figure. Oh, my god. And one of them was like the bro best friend. And another one was Christie, the blunt bestie, who’s — she was the most popular on the app, I was told, by its founder — Duh. — because she was so sassy, and she would tell it like it is, you know? So, yeah, I could upload conversations that I’d have with somebody off of dating apps, whether it was texting on iMessages or whatever it was. And the clone or the dating coach would look at all the messages, and I could ask it questions about how the conversation was going. Like what kinds of questions? So I would ask, do you think this person’s interested in me romantically, or do you think it’s more of a friend situation? Yeah. And Christie would say, oh, I’m kind of — Christie’s blunt bestie? Christie, the blunt bestie. Right. She would say, oh, I’m kind of getting buddy vibes from this one. Oh, god. Or I think this one might — maybe we can spice it up. But right now, I think this is more just kind of a platonic thing. That’s so blunt bestie vibes. Is this an actual thing that you uploaded to Christie and she actually said that to you? Yes, yes. OK, and what was your emotional reaction when blunt bestie AI dating coach told you that? Like, a “aw“? One of the situations, I was like, I don’t know, Christie. I mean, I think there might be something there. So in one of the cases, I switched over to Ethan the wingman, which is one of the other coaches that I would use because he’s more of my bro. [LAUGHS]: And he’s always going to hype me up. Like, he’s never looking to shut things down. He’s always looking for solutions. Yeah. So I asked him — So you uploaded the same conversation and you said to Eli. Yeah, I uploaded the same conversation, and he was much more optimistic. I mean, he picked out specific things that she sent or said that he said, this could be really good. And who did you decide to believe — Christie, blunt bestie, or Ethan, your bro? In that case, I stuck with Ethan, my bro. But in a lot of the cases, it’s true. Christie, her feedback actually was pretty good. Can I just follow up? So Ethan said, like, go for it, man. There could be something here. There could be a spark. And so did you proceed with the conversation in that way? Did you try to see if there was something romantic there? And was Ethan right, basically, is my question. I think in that case, Ethan was probably more right. But I think it really more comes down to just looking at these conversations with optimism or being really cautious and safe. Huh. Which is what the two coaches represented, more than actually picking up on the specific things. Can I ask you, did anything come of that relationship? Did you guys end up going on a date, date? Uh, no, not with that person. OK, but Ethan was right that there was something a little more there, but it just didn’t pan out? I think so personally. My read was closer to how Ethan saw it than Christie. Copy that. All right, gotcha. When you were asking these dating coaches to generate a response to something someone had said to you on an app, would you disclose to the people on Hinge or whatever who were applying, would you tell them — you’d send them a message, and then would you say, like, and by the way, that was generated using AI? Would you disclose that to them? I would not disclose it to them in the moment. OK. But if I would go on a date with that person, I would tell them, and I would see what they thought about it — And what — — because that felt more honest than just living this — What did people think? — this lie. How did you say it? Like, and by the way, that cool line that drew you in, that was from the Rizzler or whatever. [LAUGHS] Well, I would always bring it up. I would try to do like a roundabout way to bring it up, where I said, oh, actually — ‘cause I saw you’re a journalist. What are you writing about? I’m actually writing about this dating app story where you can use AI to generate messages. And they’re like, that’s so weird. I would totally know if someone used that. And I’m like, well, could you tell that I actually used it for these few messages? And they would be like, oh, no, I didn’t. I didn’t know. Or they would say, oh, yeah, now that you say that, I can kind of tell. Yeah. But most people were pretty put off by the idea. I never met someone that was like, I’m going to try that myself. That never happened. Would you feel — I don’t know — a bit of a weight lifted off your shoulders when you finally disclose that you were using AI? Did it feel like you were admitting something? A little bit. Yeah. I wondered how it would reflect on me if it would make me seem either kind of dishonest or — Huh. — like I wasn’t super genuine because I was using this. I mean, in one case, this person that I’ve actually been on a few dates with, the AI actually came up with this inside joke that is still kind of a thing. And I have not disclosed that this actually wasn’t me that — Oh, my gosh. — created this. Well, Eli, are you going to, or it’s too late now? I mean, I guess she’ll hear this episode and then know that. But something like that, I just felt like, oh, this is weird. Is this something that’s coming from me, or is this kind of inorganic, though? Can we know what the joke is, or is that too — Yeah, I have some prompt on my Hinge profile about — it’s like, “I know the best —” these are all so silly already. It’s like, “I know the best place in town for —” and then you fill it in. I think I said something like dim sum. Nice. And she had asked about it. And I had been using this product kind of like ChatGPT. It’s called Claude. And Claude was actually a little bit funnier. It was like a little bit better with the banter, and its whole thing was that it wasn’t telling her what the place was. And it was just trying to do other stuff or telling her — Yeah, it was diverting. — oh, maybe if I trust you more, I can tell you. Funny. So — And you still haven’t told her — — that has kind of continued on. I’ve still never told this person about this dim sum place. Wait, I have to ask, are you still seeing this person? I am. Yeah, we’re getting dim sum on this week, actually. And I’m probably going to have to confess while I’m there that the AI came up with that dim sum restaurant. [LAUGHS]: You know what’s striking me about this sort of usage of AI and dating, like the showing of the conversations and asking for advice, I do that literally all of the time with just my friends, right? I’ve been talking to this person on and off, and I am basically sending screenshots of our entire conversation from start to finish, sending off like 65 images to the friend group chat, asking for feedback. Like, this is what I’m doing with my friends, and it strikes me like AI is kind of doing that, but worse? Possibly, yeah. I think one alternative way to look at that would be you can’t always berate your friends a dozen times a day, sending them screenshots about conversations. My friends love it. Your friends love it? [LAUGHS]: Yeah, my friends would probably, I think, get tired eventually if I was like, can you come up with another opener? OK, what about another? What about another? I see what you’re saying, yeah. If you’re trying to use this stuff en masse, the AI might make sense. So actually, at one point, I have a best friend who is very similar to Ethan, the wingman, in my life. And at one point, I was like, oh, I’ll send both of them screenshots and see the difference. Interesting. You put this to the test, the question I just asked you. I put it to the test. Yeah. Yeah, my friend in real life, his name is Ryan. But Ryan is not very good at dating apps. So I was like, well, I don’t know if any of this advice is going to be really great. I don’t have somebody that nails with the advice in real life about this stuff. I don’t have a group chat that can actually give me — You got to get yourself a blunt bestie, babe. I know. I do. I really need that in real life. That might help me out. Are you still using the AI? The story’s published. It came out. Are you still using these AI tools post-publish, or did you delete the clone apps from your phone the second that you were done with this story? I have not been using the clone apps. A couple of them actually shut down after I finished reporting this because they couldn’t raise more money, or they didn’t have very much success. Cheesy, crunchy bliss was just not making a lot? That was a killer for them. Something I still do, I still ask this ChatGPT service sometimes to recommend me date spots or things we can do or activities we can do in certain neighborhoods. Because at this point, the service actually knows me pretty well. We’ve talked enough about — Wow. — how dates go. And a lot of the times, it will actually give me really good recommendations. Well, help me make something of it. Right now, it sounds like, in some way, the clone version of you or the AI tools have embedded themselves into the way that you’re using these dating apps. Like, do you think this experience of reporting the story has fundamentally changed the way you’re approaching dating in your life and will approach dating? I think so. I think it has. And I think it’s changed the way that I see my profile. And when you animate some of the ways that you describe yourself on apps or put them into conversation, it’s like, oh, this actually comes off differently than maybe I thought it did. Huh. Maybe I will actually not market myself as much of an outdoorsy person because I’m not or something like that. Yeah, yeah. After all of this, what is your verdict? Is AI going to fix our dating woes, our app fatigue? I think my takeaway is less about, can AI solve my dating life, and more, do I want it to? There are some things that, yeah, maybe I can do this. But do I want to be automating out my relationships and my dating and these moments of first meeting somebody and having meetcutes? Like, why would I want a robot to do that? I think that’s just something that I want to do myself. And I got so many emails from readers that said, dude, just go — older readers that were 60, 70 years old that would say — What did they say? Wait, that’s so cute. They were saying, back in my day, I would just go out and I would just smile at women on the street. And if they smiled back, I would go up and talk to them. You should try that. And part of me is thinking like, OK, Glenn, it’s not 1970, and times have changed. It’s actually not OK to just go out and smile at a bunch of women. We actually have to be more creative. And just generally, I think the dating advice of older generations is just so different than the experience. Like if I talk to my parents about dating, they would give me some advice like, oh, when you’re least expecting it, that’s when you’ll find love. And meanwhile, I’m like, trying to get my clone to date as many people in San Francisco as I can, you know? I’m like, my clone’s not really picking up my sense of humor that well. It’s like a totally separated — Your mom’s like, join a volleyball league. Yeah, my mom, I was talking to her on the phone yesterday. She’s like, maybe you should pick up a hobby that men also do, like woodworking. I was like, I’m not talking to you about this. Yeah, I mean, I guess, to that point, OK, so it sounds like you are committed or at least are seeking these kind of moments of serendipity and connection in real life. Are there ways that you are trying to cultivate that off the apps these days? I am, but it’s hard. Well, one, you can’t schedule serendipity. That’s true. I wish we could. It’s kind of counteractive. But yeah, I’ve tried — I think there’s this whole network now of these dating events that you can do because people are so frustrated with the apps. So they try to get people in person. And I mean, one of them, I tried one of these singles running clubs once. Oh, brother And I mean, I realized this as we started running. I’m like, I’m not a runner. Like — [LAUGHS]: — this is like a five-mile run. You’re like, time to go back to the clone. I am huffing and puffing. I’m like, I’m just making the good runners look even better because I’m not even trying to talk to someone. I’m just trying to get through this run. Right, right, right. So things like that where it’s like, OK, you really have to be extroverted, I think, to be going to some of these in-person events. And meeting people through friends of friends or whoever it is, is still probably, for me, the ideal way. But it’s just not something that you can — Schedule. — plan ahead or try to do a bunch of. It’s something that just happens naturally, I would say. [MUSIC PLAYING] Eli Tan, what a fun conversation. Thank you for joining me on the show today. Thanks so much for having me. What fun.

Unresponsive texters. Boring conversations. An endless stream of dudes on boats holding the fish they’ve caught. Talk to single people using dating apps, and they are likely to tell you that the experience is awful, but that they have to be there. Dating apps are just how singles meet one another these days. But what if artificial intelligence could fix modern dating? The Times reporter Eli Tanexplored that hypothesis. Eli joined several new dating apps that seek to duplicate a user’s personality via chatbot and let the A.I. clone do the dating. He also received flirting advice from a squadron of A.I. dating coaches. He used that advice on real dates, actually trying to find a connection, to see how the A.I.’s guidance held up. On this episode of Modern Love, Eli tells us what happened when he revealed his use of A.I. to his dates, and whether the technology may actually push us toward more authentic interactions on the apps.

My Son Is Gone. Our Conversation Goes On.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/style/modern-love-my-son-is-gone-our-conversation-goes-on.html,"Advertisement Supported by Modern Love Three days before my child unexpectedly died, he primed me to keep living. ByNikki Mark Every night before I go to sleep, I write in a journal to my 12-year-old son, Tommy, and continue a conversation we started on April 13, 2018, just three days before he unexpectedly passed away. Tommy was particularly chatty that Friday afternoon as we drove from Los Angeles to San Diego for his weekend soccer match. “Remember my plan, Mom,” he said. “First, I’m going to be a professional soccer player in Europe. Then when I retire, I’m going to be a coach of a midlevel pro team. After that, I’ll be a soccer commentator on television.” I told him that sounded like a great plan. And I wondered if he knew himself better at 12 than I did at 48. “At some point, I’ll have two kids and a fashion line,” he added — just like his favorite pro players did. “Nothing is impossible,” I said, echoing a belief I routinely share while helping inspire entrepreneurs to achieve their dreams.

Hey, it’s Anna. The episode you’re about to hear is from a special series celebrating the 20th anniversary of the “Modern Love” column. It originally aired in early 2024. We hope you enjoy it. [THEME MUSIC] Love now and for always. Did you fall in love? Just tell her I love her. Love is stronger than anything you can feel. For the love. Love. And I love you more than anything. (SINGING) What is love? Here’s to love. Love. [THEME MUSIC] From “The New York Times,” I’m Anna Martin. This is “Modern Love.” This year marks the 20th anniversary of the “Modern Love” column. 20 years — can you believe that? Two decades of essays that have made us laugh, made us gasp, broken our hearts, reminded us of the fundamental goodness of people. And — let’s be honest — a lot of these essays should come with tissues. It’s kind of our thing here — making you cry. To mark this big anniversary, we’ve got a conversation with “Modern Love” founder Daniel Jones. Dan has edited around 1,000 essays since the first one ran back in 2004. And when you spend all your professional time contemplating human connection, that work doesn’t stay at the office. It impacts you in profound ways. So today, Dan shares the three essays that have changed the way he approaches love and relationships in his own life. So it feels strange to say what I say to guests on the show, which is welcome, because, really, you welcomed me into this universe. So instead of saying welcome, I’m going to say, Dan Jones, hello, and thank you so much. It is great to be back here. The “Modern Love” column has been around for almost 20 years, which is a long time. And I do not say this in a rude way, but that also means that you are 20 years older than you were when you started it. Is there anything that’s happened in your life over those two decades that has changed your approach to the work or reframed it in some way? Hmm. I’ve gone from being young to less young over that time. [LAUGHS] Delicately put. [LAUGHS] I started the column with children who are now very much adults and have gone through their own breakups and traumas and all of that and got out into the world and gotten jobs. My marriage of 29 years came to an amicable end. My father died, and there’s been a lot of tough family time since then. But I feel like my life was pretty stable during the family child rearing years. And then, oddly timed to the pandemic, I have to say — [LAUGHS] Has happened to many, yeah. — it just opened up, and it was like the column was saying to me, OK, you’re going to experience the whole range of what you’ve been putting out there. And interestingly enough, I feel like working on the column for all these years has given me touchstones and tools — and not just for me, for other people, too — to be able to navigate difficult times in life. It feels like this churning reservoir of human experience that feeds into your veins if you are open to it. I love what you said, that you gave so much to the column. And now you’re in this place in your career and your life where it’s giving back to you. I mean, what a — It’s like an annuity program, you know? Yeah, it’s like a 401(k). Right, right. Exactly. It’s like a Roth IRA. It’s the “Modern Love” 401(k). That’s a sexy way to say it, right? You know? I’m withdrawing. [GASPS]: I’m getting close to the age where I’m going to be forced to withdraw. So that’s a good thing. People are loving this metaphor. Yeah. OK, so that’s where you are now. But when you were starting the column, did you see yourself as an expert in relationships or in romance? I wasn’t great at romantic relationships. I was like, how does this work? How does this work? Wait — I was really terrible at it in high school. I was really terrible at it in college. Mm-hmm. I still found it really hard. I had my first girlfriend in grad school. [LAUGHS]: Took you a while. But very slow learning, very shy. But I think just the weightiness of romantic relationships is a scary thing. And I wasn’t paralyzed with fear or anything. I assumed I’d get married and have a family. All those things were just assumptions and didn’t seem all that hard to make happen, in a way. But the complications of relationships and loss and just all those big things, I felt like those were things that happened to somebody else. Those were out there and were these deep, dark wells that I hadn’t really experienced and didn’t have a sense of how to navigate. Hmm. How did the people in your life react when you told them like, hey, I got a new gig. I will be covering love and relationships [LAUGHS]: at “The New York Times“? How did people react? Some people were just — they were surprised that that would be my subject. Huh. And that would be my beat, in a way. To me, I don’t think of love and relationships as being a beat. I think of it as being like the center of all life, you know? It’s like, it’s not off to the side. Say that, mm-hmm. It’s the center of things. Honestly, I don’t like the word “romance.” It just feels shallow and — Or schlocky? — schlocky and whatever. But the word “love” has it all. It’s like, that’s the core of human existence, it seems to me. It’s the stuff of life and loss and death and yearning and dreaming and all of that stuff. Mm. Have you come to that understanding of these stories about love are really stories about life? Did you enter into the column, the early days of this column, with that understanding, or has that been worked out over 20 years of editing these pieces? We started that way a little intentionally. We made it clear that the stories were not just about romantic relationships. It was of family relationships and friendships and parenthood and the whole gamut of human love and bonds. And in coming up with a title, “Modern Love,” we wanted an umbrella that was wide enough to encompass love. And the “modern” part of it could mean a lot of things. To me, it meant something that was contemporary, like a way we connect that we didn’t use to, or the way we use technology, the way we have children that we didn’t use to, all of those ways that are now. And we just thought “modern” would cover that piece of it. OK, so another big part of the column is that it’s totally based on reader submissions, meaning anyone can send in their idea for a story and you select the ones you want to edit and then publish. Why did you go with that submission model as opposed to commissioning stories from famous writers or other well-known people? I just thought, let’s just open the floodgates and see what comes in. I didn’t realize at the time what a great idea that was because — [LAUGHS]: I realized later, I’m a genius. I’m a freakin’ genius for coming up with that. But not like it’s any kind of new idea, but for this kind of a forum, it was essential. And as an example, we published a story by a Bangladeshi immigrant who’d been a taxi driver in New York in an arranged marriage from Bangladesh, had won the visa lottery and moved here. Then they settled in Queens. They had a daughter. She became a doctor. And I asked him, what made you write this story, your love story from 30 years ago, and bringing it up to now? What made you submit it? And he said, oh, I’ve been reading “Modern Love” for 20 years. Oh. You know? Mm-hmm. I’ve been reading it every week. And he wasn’t a writer. He’d just been reading the column and thought — Wow. — I have a story. All these people who have stories, they read stories. They think, what about my story? And that’s something I was late in realizing, that it was just — it had drawn stories out of people who otherwise would not have told them. Mm. It felt like a safe space for them. They thought, well, other people have done it — Totally. — so I could do it, too. [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back, Dan chooses the three essays that taught him the most about love, with a little help from Jake Gyllenhaal and Connie Britton. Stay with us. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right. So, Dan, can you please kick us off with the first essay you want to talk about? Yeah. So this is an essay. It’s called “One Bouquet of Fleeting Beauty, Please.” And the writer is named Alisha Gorder. So this is a story that begins with a young woman working in a flower shop, describing the kinds of customers who come in, the kinds of flower bouquets that they buy, and for what reason. And you think you’re in this light, airy story about a flower shop. And then about halfway through, it takes a plunge into this really troubling back story where her high school boyfriend had died by suicide at age 18. And it throws what she’s talking about and the flower shop into a whole new context. And in the end, it turns into a meditation of, why flowers? Why are these the things that people rely on for these important transitions and moments in life? And comes to a wisdom at the end that has just stayed with me ever since. And long-time listeners will remember that this essay was featured on the podcast years ago, back when we had celebrities and voice actors read the essays. Let’s hear a part of this one performed, I think, really tenderly by the actor Kerry Bishé. “There’s a picture I took of him just days before I left for college, two months before he died. It was the summer of chips and guacamole dinners we shared, sitting on the living room floor. He’s standing in the kitchen wearing a white T-shirt and jeans, one perfect half of an avocado cradled in his hand. His face is turned away, hidden from the camera. But I like to think he’s smiling. [MUSIC PLAYING] I remember the song we were listening to, the chatter of frogs through the screen door, my bare feet on wood — precious moments made all the more precious by the fact that they have already come and gone. Now I measure months by what’s in season — sunflowers in July, dahlias in August, rose hips and maple in October, pine in December, hyacinth in March, crowd-pleasing peonies in May. A favorite of mine is tulip magnolia — the way the buds erupt into blooms and the blooms into a litter of color on lawns, all in a matter of weeks while it’s snowing cherry blossoms. How startlingly beautiful impermanence can be.” You said that it’s that ending and, in fact, it’s that final line that really speaks to you. Can you tell me what you learn or take away from that line? It’s sort of grown on me, “how startlingly beautiful impermanence can be.” It’s not that love or connection is beautiful and impermanent. It’s beautiful because it’s impermanent. [LAUGHS] And the fleeting nature of any connection is what makes it precious and what makes it beautiful. And the way that she saw this in petals on the ground that are soon to dry up and go away, but the beauty is in that it won’t last. Hmm. I mean, there’s this section, I think, a little bit earlier than that when she even poses the question quite directly, like, why flowers? Why do we give these things that are going to shrivel and die? Yeah. You have to throw away, yeah. And I love what you’re saying. It’s not despite the impermanence. It’s really loving because of it, because our time is — Mm-hmm. That is the arc of life. It’s shortened with flower blossoms. But that is it. It sometimes lasts a long time, sometimes a short time. But it will always feel fleeting in a way, that a level of beauty. What does this essay make you think about in terms of your own life or your own Relationships To me, it’s about — I mean, it’s a buzzword we always hear about, but here, it really comes home to roost — is presence as being present. And it’s always the hardest thing for me — for a lot of people — appreciating what you have now and not thinking about what you’re building toward and what you’re accumulating wealth for and what’s to come, but the connections you have now that are beautiful in the moment and not fearing that you’re going to lose them — because you are. That’s a certainty. But just being able to be present and appreciate them, and the fact that it’s this young woman who was able to artfully, in the midst of grief, compose such a beautiful piece that teaches that is just miraculous to me. You mentioned earlier that your dad passed. Did you return to this essay then? Was it in the back of your mind as you were processing all that? It must have been because I was scrolling through the archive and saw that illustration and clicked on it. And I did see it in a new way. I remembered how much I appreciated it at the time. I was able to hold it together here. [LAUGHS]: But when I read it aloud to a friend, who obviously was sitting there when I was rereading it, I couldn’t get through the final lines. I was really broken up by it. It sounds like this piece resonated with you and spoke to you in a different way years later, which is really powerful. Do you want to talk about the next essay? Yeah so this one is called “Nursing a Wound in an Appropriate Setting.” It’s written by Thomas Hooven, who is a doctor. He’s not a writer. But you would never know that — No, you would not. — from reading this incredible essay. And I think about this essay all the time. This was published in 2013. He describes his relationship with his long-time girlfriend before he goes to medical school. They knew each other for 12 years. They were both the children of divorce and of unstable households that were scary. And they gave each other a sense of safety. He describes their relationship as being no fighting. Fighting was what their parents did. Fighting would threaten their equilibrium. Yeah. Fighting would threaten their love. And so it was a flat, safe relationship. They were together for 12 years. They got engaged. He was about to head off to medical school. And then she abruptly broke up with him. I think there were only a few weeks from their marriage — Three. — from their wedding. Three weeks. Three weeks. [CHUCKLES] Wild. And he was just — devastated doesn’t begin to describe it. And he goes off to medical school or his residency, and it’s sort of his boot camp in feelings and complications and devastation and real life, like real life. And then after this time in the wilderness in his residency and going through all this, he learns what real love is. Yeah, I mean, his idea of what real love is at the end of the essay is so powerful. This essay was also featured on an early season of the podcast. So here’s Jake Gyllenhaal reading Thomas Hooven’s essay “Nursing a Wound in an Appropriate Setting.” Yeah, this one is so great. “My ex and I are not in touch. Our relationship so long in the making and so quick to end was like an ornamental piece of crystal — aesthetically pleasing, but lacking resilience and once shattered, irrecoverable. Looking back at the various romantic and not-so-romantic dating experiences I had afterwards, it’s hard to separate my growth as an emotionally conversant partner from my development as a capable physician. Both happened simultaneously and gradually through stretches of triumph and sorrow. There were no Eureka moments, and neither ever really ended. The turmoil I experienced as an intern left me with a deeper understanding of how pain works, how it feels, how it ebbs, and how it leaves you less naive. I also learned to open up to important facets of life that my previous relationship had locked out — unhappiness, uncertainty, and regret. Comfort around feelings like these is crucial in both medicine and intimate relationships. It’s the basis of empathy. I didn’t understand that before my ex left me. And I learned it the hard way. By the time I met my wife, I was a changed man and a real doctor. And our love developed differently from any I had ever experienced before — less like a crystal vase, more like a basketball. Our relationship is made for bouncing, for good and sometimes rough play that modern professional lives generate. We do have fights — oh, yes, we do. But they do not threaten our foundation. They deepen it.” Tell me what you take away about Thomas’s articulation of what real love is. What is he saying? Well, this is one of these essays that I feel like mirrored my experience, in a way. Like, I didn’t come from a family of turmoil. But I’m afraid of conflict, total fear of conflict. Don’t like to fight, don’t like to argue. My idea of a successful, romantic, loving relationship was being in a harmonious space all the time — or not all the time. Sometimes you’d be bored, but you wouldn’t be fighting. And so this idea that fighting can bring you closer is revolutionary to me. It still is revolutionary to me in not only that it can bring you closer, but it’s the only thing to bring you closer and the only thing to deepen your relationship. Fighting can lead to the end of a relationship, definitely. But the only way forward and the only way deeper is through conflict and resolving conflicts to a new understanding of the relationship and who you’re with and the person you’re with and getting to know them better and all of that. And I don’t know what business he has writing this well about — You’re like, listen — Like, it’s not fair to be like a doctor. — you’re already a doctor. I know — and also to be able to write this well about and understand — Aw. — love this well and loss and conflict and depth, it’s remarkable. Mm. So are you fighting all the time now? No. I still need to learn how to fight better. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let’s talk about the final essay. This is an essay by Elizabeth Fitzsimmons. It’s called “My First Lesson in Motherhood.” Can you tell me what that essay is about? Yeah, so this is a piece that ran on Mother’s Day way back in 2007. And it’s yet another one that takes a really dramatic turn — several dramatic turns. And it’s an essay about bravery when you didn’t think you had the capacity for it. It’s a couple who are having trouble getting pregnant and decide to adopt a baby girl in China. And they specifically fill out forms saying like, we’re new parents. We don’t want any disabilities, any — we can’t deal with anything, basically, [LAUGHS]: except for just a perfect, little, healthy baby. And they get a baby who’s chosen for them by the time they get there and meet with the baby and are alone with her for the first time. They discover alarming physical problems, a really bad rash and a scar at the base of her spine, and hear a horrifying diagnosis that the child will be paralyzed from the waist down, will be incontinent, will have serious, serious problems. And unbelievably, they talk to the agents from the adoption agency, and they say, oh, well, you know, we’re sorry about this, and essentially offer a swap for a different baby. Yeah, that’s a moment that is unbelievable in this piece. The view of human life in that circumstance. So this essay was read by the actress Connie Britton in 2016. And you can just hear the emotional stakes of this story in her performance. Let’s listen to it. Yeah, she’s really perfect for this one. “I pictured myself boarding the plane with some faceless replacement child and then explaining to friends and family that she wasn’t Natalie; that we had left Natalie in China because she was too damaged; that the deal had been a healthy baby, and she wasn’t. How could I face myself? How could I ever forget? I would always wonder what happened to Natalie. [MUSIC PLAYING] I knew this was my test, my life’s worth distilled into a moment. I was shaking my head no before they finished explaining. We didn’t want another baby, I told them. We wanted our baby, the one sleeping right over there. She’s our daughter, I said. We love her. Yet we had a long, fraught night ahead wondering how we would possibly cope. I called my mother in tears and told her the news. There was a long pause. ‘Oh, honey.’ I sobbed. She waited until I caught my breath. ‘It would be OK if you came home without her.’ ‘Why are you saying that?’ ‘I just want to absolve you. What do you want to do?’ ‘I want to take my baby and get out of here,’ I said. ‘Good,’ my mother said. ‘Then that’s what you should do.’” I mean, I’m tearing up. Me, too. So the lesson in this piece to me is about a test. It’s really a test. It’s like, what are you capable of? Like, what kind of devotion? What kind of sense of responsibility? What are you going to take on? And they have to decide in the moment, are they going to stick with this child with this horrifying set of health complications that could control their lives forever, or are they going to push that baby aside and accept a healthier baby? And then, how do they live with themselves if they do that? Neither choice is an appealing choice. No. This essay — I mean, all of these essays bowled me over, and this one just made me — I mean, I quite literally called my mom after this. It is such a moving [SIGHS]: testament to just the completely inexplicable, immediate bond between parent and child. Yeah, I’m still crying. I mean, it’s remarkable. Tell me what you’re taking — I mean, you are a parent. Tell me what you’re thinking about when you read this essay. Well, first of all, I think anyone reading this thinks, what choice would I have made? Of course. And you would like to think that you would make the choice of keeping the child. But honestly, one of the most moving things and tragic things that happened in the wake of publishing this essay is we got emails from people who had faced this choice and — Wow. — made the opposite choice and either left with a healthy baby and struggled and struggled and struggled with having done that. More common was giving up on adoption entirely and just walking away, and walking away from that child or any child. But she’s just like, I’m going to walk into this. I’m going to just walk forward into this, and it’s going to be what it’s going to be. And miracle of miracles, within a year or so, all that stuff has gone away. They see a specialist. I know. The kid is fine. I’m going to cry again. It’s like after making this decision, they go home, and she heals. Oh. Yeah. And she recoiled at thinking that was a reward for making the right choice. She said, it’s not about that. It’s not about, we were generous, or we were good, and therefore, our child turned out fine. It’s not that at all. It just happened that way. But it’s yet another lesson in you can’t predict the smooth path. You just have to walk forward and be brave. I often say with “Modern Love” stories that are really about choices and hard choices and how it’s ordinary people being incredibly brave, I mean, I often wonder what creates the person who can make the brave choice versus the person who shrinks from it? Like, what is that magic sauce? Or what is that childhood experience? Or what is the parenting that they have? Totally. Because there is a divide. There is a divide often in those circumstances that we saw in the outpouring after the essay. We see instances of bravery in all three of the essays that you’ve shared today — bravery to embrace the brevity of love, bravery to engage in fighting in a relationship, bravery to make a choice. Would you define bravery as like a core act of love? Yeah, a core act of love and a core act of life. People’s bravery has been my biggest takeaway over 20 years of doing this work. It’s never a person who says, I am brave. It’s almost the opposite. It’s people who say, I’m not brave. I’m a coward. And yet — Totally. — and just the lesson of that, life — it’s going to be a mess one way or the other. You just choose your mess. But that is what it is. That is life. You’re not going to avoid it. There’s such a school of life that is about trying to make your life as clean and tidy as possible. And it’s really a struggle to do that. And I’m not sure it’s well-directed energy. [CHUCKLES] What do you think we should direct our energy to? And now this is just truly me asking you because I want you to give me life advice — if not to cleaning up our life. Well, no, I’m not an advice giver, Anna. I know, but just please — You should know that. — put on the hat for one second. Like, if not to direct our energy towards cleaning up our life in your 20 years of doing this work, what is the more worthwhile thing to direct energy towards? This is not exactly new advice, but it’s really the wisdom from Alisha Gorder’s essay, which is, be in the moment. Value the people you’re with now. Don’t think I’m planning for 10 years from now. Get your 401(k) out of your mind. Contribute to it, but put it out of your mind. It’s the now. It’s the now. That is the work. Dan I love that. It’s the now. I feel like so many listeners right now are clinging to every word you’ve said, trying to figure out what you’re looking for in a “Modern Love” essay pitch. And by the way, you can send those submissions to ModernLove@nytimes.com. Dan, can you give us a few quick tips on what makes a story stand out in your inbox? Well, a bad subject line is “Modern Love Submission.” You’re like 80 percent of people who submit. And a good subject line would include an attempt at a title, which would be like, “Please, Lord, Let Him Be 27.” Please, Lord. Yeah. I read that subject line. It was funny. It was smart. It was vulnerable. I just prayed the essay would deliver on that promise. And it did deliver. We actually featured it on the podcast a few seasons ago. So a good subject line is very practical advice, but what about the essence of a story? What are you looking for there? Harder to define. Quality is a sense of humility. There’s a sense that you’re not the smartest person in the world, but you do have something to offer. And in the world of pitching and of trying to get published, there’s an overriding sense that you have to act confident. You have to sell your product. You have to say, this essay is going to be perfect for you. And that’s just the wrong approach. That kind of confidence is not what a hard experience leaves you with. It can leave you shaken. It can leave you wise. But it doesn’t leave you cocky. And I think it’s important that the stories aren’t really about answers. They’re about a search for answers. And they don’t need to come to a conclusion, but they need to present a problem in an interesting way that makes you think about it. Well, now you’re going to get even more submissions that can fuel the next 20 years of “Modern Love.” Dan, thank you so much for the conversation today. Thanks, Anna. That was a lot of fun.

The episode you’re about to hear is from a special series celebrating the 20th anniversary of the “Modern Love” column. It originally aired in early 2024. We hope you enjoy it. [THEME MUSIC] Love now and for always. Did you fall in love? Just tell her I love her. Love is stronger than anything you can feel. For the love. Love. And I love you more than anything. (SINGING) What is love? Here’s to love. Love. [THEME MUSIC] From “The New York Times,” I’m Anna Martin. This is “Modern Love.” This year marks the 20th anniversary of the “Modern Love” column. 20 years — can you believe that? Two decades of essays that have made us laugh, made us gasp, broken our hearts, reminded us of the fundamental goodness of people. And — let’s be honest — a lot of these essays should come with tissues. It’s kind of our thing here — making you cry. To mark this big anniversary, we’ve got a conversation with “Modern Love” founder Daniel Jones. Dan has edited around 1,000 essays since the first one ran back in 2004. And when you spend all your professional time contemplating human connection, that work doesn’t stay at the office. It impacts you in profound ways. So today, Dan shares the three essays that have changed the way he approaches love and relationships in his own life. So it feels strange to say what I say to guests on the show, which is welcome, because, really, you welcomed me into this universe. So instead of saying welcome, I’m going to say, Dan Jones, hello, and thank you so much. It is great to be back here. The “Modern Love” column has been around for almost 20 years, which is a long time. And I do not say this in a rude way, but that also means that you are 20 years older than you were when you started it. Is there anything that’s happened in your life over those two decades that has changed your approach to the work or reframed it in some way? Hmm. I’ve gone from being young to less young over that time. [LAUGHS] Delicately put. [LAUGHS] I started the column with children who are now very much adults and have gone through their own breakups and traumas and all of that and got out into the world and gotten jobs. My marriage of 29 years came to an amicable end. My father died, and there’s been a lot of tough family time since then. But I feel like my life was pretty stable during the family child rearing years. And then, oddly timed to the pandemic, I have to say — [LAUGHS] Has happened to many, yeah. — it just opened up, and it was like the column was saying to me, OK, you’re going to experience the whole range of what you’ve been putting out there. And interestingly enough, I feel like working on the column for all these years has given me touchstones and tools — and not just for me, for other people, too — to be able to navigate difficult times in life. It feels like this churning reservoir of human experience that feeds into your veins if you are open to it. I love what you said, that you gave so much to the column. And now you’re in this place in your career and your life where it’s giving back to you. I mean, what a — It’s like an annuity program, you know? Yeah, it’s like a 401(k). Right, right. Exactly. It’s like a Roth IRA. It’s the “Modern Love” 401(k). That’s a sexy way to say it, right? You know? I’m withdrawing. [GASPS]: I’m getting close to the age where I’m going to be forced to withdraw. So that’s a good thing. People are loving this metaphor. Yeah. OK, so that’s where you are now. But when you were starting the column, did you see yourself as an expert in relationships or in romance? I wasn’t great at romantic relationships. I was like, how does this work? How does this work? Wait — I was really terrible at it in high school. I was really terrible at it in college. Mm-hmm. I still found it really hard. I had my first girlfriend in grad school. [LAUGHS]: Took you a while. But very slow learning, very shy. But I think just the weightiness of romantic relationships is a scary thing. And I wasn’t paralyzed with fear or anything. I assumed I’d get married and have a family. All those things were just assumptions and didn’t seem all that hard to make happen, in a way. But the complications of relationsh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ps and loss and just all those big things, I felt like those were things that happened to somebody else. Those were out there and were these deep, dark wells that I hadn’t really experienced and didn’t have a sense of how to navigate. Hmm. How did the people in your life react when you told them like, hey, I got a new gig. I will be covering love and relationships [LAUGHS]: at “The New York Times“? How did people react? Some people were just — they were surprised that that would be my subject. Huh. And that would be my beat, in a way. To me, I don’t think of love and relationships as being a beat. I think of it as being like the center of all life, you know? It’s like, it’s not off to the side. Say that, mm-hmm. It’s the center of things. Honestly, I don’t like the word “romance.” It just feels shallow and — Or schlocky? — schlocky and whatever. But the word “love” has it all. It’s like, that’s the core of human existence, it seems to me. It’s the stuff of life and loss and death and yearning and dreaming and all of that stuff. Mm. Have you come to that understanding of these stories about love are really stories about life? Did you enter into the column, the early days of this column, with that understanding, or has that been worked out over 20 years of editing these pieces? We started that way a little intentionally. We made it clear that the stories were not just about romantic relationships. It was of family relationships and friendships and parenthood and the whole gamut of human love and bonds. And in coming up with a title, “Modern Love,” we wanted an umbrella that was wide enough to encompass love. And the “modern” part of it could mean a lot of things. To me, it meant something that was contemporary, like a way we connect that we didn’t use to, or the way we use technology, the way we have children that we didn’t use to, all of those ways that are now. And we just thought “modern” would cover that piece of it. OK, so another big part of the column is that it’s totally based on reader submissions, meaning anyone can send in their idea for a story and you select the ones you want to edit and then publish. Why did you go with that submission model as opposed to commissioning stories from famous writers or other well-known people? I just thought, let’s just open the floodgates and see what comes in. I didn’t realize at the time what a great idea that was because — [LAUGHS]: I realized later, I’m a genius. I’m a freakin’ genius for coming up with that. But not like it’s any kind of new idea, but for this kind of a forum, it was essential. And as an example, we published a story by a Bangladeshi immigrant who’d been a taxi driver in New York in an arranged marriage from Bangladesh, had won the visa lottery and moved here. Then they settled in Queens. They had a daughter. She became a doctor. And I asked him, what made you write this story, your love story from 30 years ago, and bringing it up to now? What made you submit it? And he said, oh, I’ve been reading “Modern Love” for 20 years. Oh. You know? Mm-hmm. I’ve been reading it every week. And he wasn’t a writer. He’d just been reading the column and thought — Wow. — I have a story. All these people who have stories, they read stories. They think, what about my story? And that’s something I was late in realizing, that it was just — it had drawn stories out of people who otherwise would not have told them. Mm. It felt like a safe space for them. They thought, well, other people have done it — Totally. — so I could do it, too. [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back, Dan chooses the three essays that taught him the most about love, with a little help from Jake Gyllenhaal and Connie Britton. Stay with us. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right. So, Dan, can you please kick us off with the first essay you want to talk about? Yeah. So this is an essay. It’s called “One Bouquet of Fleeting Beauty, Please.” And the writer is named Alisha Gorder. So this is a story that begins with a young woman working in a flower shop, describing the kinds of customers who come in, the kinds of flower bouquets that they buy, and for what reason. And you think you’re in this light, airy story about a flower shop. And then about halfway through, it takes a plunge into this really troubling back story where her high school boyfriend had died by suicide at age 18. And it throws what she’s talking about and the flower shop into a whole new context. And in the end, it turns into a meditation of, why flowers? Why are these the things that people rely on for these important transitions and moments in life? And comes to a wisdom at the end that has just stayed with me ever since. And long-time listeners will remember that this essay was featured on the podcast years ago, back when we had celebrities and voice actors read the essays. Let’s hear a part of this one performed, I think, really tenderly by the actor Kerry Bishé. “There’s a picture I took of him just days before I left for college, two months before he died. It was the summer of chips and guacamole dinners we shared, sitting on the living room floor. He’s standing in the kitchen wearing a white T-shirt and jeans, one perfect half of an avocado cradled in his hand. His face is turned away, hidden from the camera. But I like to think he’s smiling. [MUSIC PLAYING] I remember the song we were listening to, the chatter of frogs through the screen door, my bare feet on wood — precious moments made all the more precious by the fact that they have already come and gone. Now I measure months by what’s in season — sunflowers in July, dahlias in August, rose hips and maple in October, pine in December, hyacinth in March, crowd-pleasing peonies in May. A favorite of mine is tulip magnolia — the way the buds erupt into blooms and the blooms into a litter of color on lawns, all in a matter of weeks while it’s snowing cherry blossoms. How startlingly beautiful impermanence can be.” You said that it’s that ending and, in fact, it’s that final line that really speaks to you. Can you tell me what you learn or take away from that line? It’s sort of grown on me, “how startlingly beautiful impermanence can be.” It’s not that love or connection is beautiful and impermanent. It’s beautiful because it’s impermanent. [LAUGHS] And the fleeting nature of any connection is what makes it precious and what makes it beautiful. And the way that she saw this in petals on the ground that are soon to dry up and go away, but the beauty is in that it won’t last. Hmm. I mean, there’s this section, I think, a little bit earlier than that when she even poses the question quite directly, like, why flowers? Why do we give these things that are going to shrivel and die? Yeah. You have to throw away, yeah. And I love what you’re saying. It’s not despite the impermanence. It’s really loving because of it, because our time is — Mm-hmm. That is the arc of life. It’s shortened with flower blossoms. But that is it. It sometimes lasts a long time, sometimes a short time. But it will always feel fleeting in a way, that a level of beauty. What does this essay make you think about in terms of your own life or your own Relationships To me, it’s about — I mean, it’s a buzzword we always hear about, but here, it really comes home to roost — is presence as being present. And it’s always the hardest thing for me — for a lot of people — appreciating what you have now and not thinking about what you’re building toward and what you’re accumulating wealth for and what’s to come, but the connections you have now that are beautiful in the moment and not fearing that you’re going to lose them — because you are. That’s a certainty. But just being able to be present and appreciate them, and the fact that it’s this young woman who was able to artfully, in the midst of grief, compose such a beautiful piece that teaches that is just miraculous to me. You mentioned earlier that your dad passed. Did you return to this essay then? Was it in the back of your mind as you were processing all that? It must have been because I was scrolling through the archive and saw that illustration and clicked on it. And I did see it in a new way. I remembered how much I appreciated it at the time. I was able to hold it together here. [LAUGHS]: But when I read it aloud to a friend, who obviously was sitting there when I was rereading it, I couldn’t get through the final lines. I was really broken up by it. It sounds like this piece resonated with you and spoke to you in a different way years later, which is really powerful. Do you want to talk about the next essay? Yeah so this one is called “Nursing a Wound in an Appropriate Setting.” It’s written by Thomas Hooven, who is a doctor. He’s not a writer. But you would never know that — No, you would not. — from reading this incredible essay. And I think about this essay all the time. This was published in 2013. He describes his relationship with his long-time girlfriend before he goes to medical school. They knew each other for 12 years. They were both the children of divorce and of unstable households that were scary. And they gave each other a sense of safety. He describes their relationship as being no fighting. Fighting was what their parents did. Fighting would threaten their equilibrium. Yeah. Fighting would threaten their love. And so it was a flat, safe relationship. They were together for 12 years. They got engaged. He was about to head off to medical school. And then she abruptly broke up with him. I think there were only a few weeks from their marriage — Three. — from their wedding. Three weeks. Three weeks. [CHUCKLES] Wild. And he was just — devastated doesn’t begin to describe it. And he goes off to medical school or his residency, and it’s sort of his boot camp in feelings and complications and devastation and real life, like real life. And then after this time in the wilderness in his residency and going through all this, he learns what real love is. Yeah, I mean, his idea of what real love is at the end of the essay is so powerful. This essay was also featured on an early season of the podcast. So here’s Jake Gyllenhaal reading Thomas Hooven’s essay “Nursing a Wound in an Appropriate Setting.” Yeah, this one is so great. “My ex and I are not in touch. Our relationship so long in the making and so quick to end was like an ornamental piece of crystal — aesthetically pleasing, but lacking resilience and once shattered, irrecoverable. Looking back at the various romantic and not-so-romantic dating experiences I had afterwards, it’s hard to separate my growth as an emotionally conversant partner from my development as a capable physician. Both happened simultaneously and gradually through stretches of triumph and sorrow. There were no Eureka moments, and neither ever really ended. The turmoil I experienced as an intern left me with a deeper understanding of how pain works, how it feels, how it ebbs, and how it leaves you less naive. I also learned to open up to important facets of life that my previous relationship had locked out — unhappiness, uncertainty, and regret. Comfort around feelings like these is crucial in both medicine and intimate relationships. It’s the basis of empathy. I didn’t understand that before my ex left me. And I learned it the hard way. By the time I met my wife, I was a changed man and a real doctor. And our love developed differently from any I had ever experienced before — less like a crystal vase, more like a basketball. Our relationship is made for bouncing, for good and sometimes rough play that modern professional lives generate. We do have fights — oh, yes, we do. But they do not threaten our foundation. They deepen it.” Tell me what you take away about Thomas’s articulation of what real love is. What is he saying? Well, this is one of these essays that I feel like mirrored my experience, in a way. Like, I didn’t come from a family of turmoil. But I’m afraid of conflict, total fear of conflict. Don’t like to fight, don’t like to argue. My idea of a successful, romantic, loving relationship was being in a harmonious space all the time — or not all the time. Sometimes you’d be bored, but you wouldn’t be fighting. And so this idea that fighting can bring you closer is revolutionary to me. It still is revolutionary to me in not only that it can bring you closer, but it’s the only thing to bring you closer and the only thing to deepen your relationship. Fighting can lead to the end of a relationship, definitely. But the only way forward and the only way deeper is through conflict and resolving conflicts to a new understanding of the relationship and who you’re with and the person you’re with and getting to know them better and all of that. And I don’t know what business he has writing this well about — You’re like, listen — Like, it’s not fair to be like a doctor. — you’re already a doctor. I know — and also to be able to write this well about and understand — Aw. — love this well and loss and conflict and depth, it’s remarkable. Mm. So are you fighting all the time now? No. I still need to learn how to fight better. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let’s talk about the final essay. This is an essay by Elizabeth Fitzsimmons. It’s called “My First Lesson in Motherhood.” Can you tell me what that essay is about? Yeah, so this is a piece that ran on Mother’s Day way back in 2007. And it’s yet another one that takes a really dramatic turn — several dramatic turns. And it’s an essay about bravery when you didn’t think you had the capacity for it. It’s a couple who are having trouble getting pregnant and decide to adopt a baby girl in China. And they specifically fill out forms saying like, we’re new parents. We don’t want any disabilities, any — we can’t deal with anything, basically, [LAUGHS]: except for just a perfect, little, healthy baby. And they get a baby who’s chosen for them by the time they get there and meet with the baby and are alone with her for the first time. They discover alarming physical problems, a really bad rash and a scar at the base of her spine, and hear a horrifying diagnosis that the child will be paralyzed from the waist down, will be incontinent, will have serious, serious problems. And unbelievably, they talk to the agents from the adoption agency, and they say, oh, well, you know, we’re sorry about this, and essentially offer a swap for a different baby. Yeah, that’s a moment that is unbelievable in this piece. The view of human life in that circumstance. So this essay was read by the actress Connie Britton in 2016. And you can just hear the emotional stakes of this story in her performance. Let’s listen to it. Yeah, she’s really perfect for this one. “I pictured myself boarding the plane with some faceless replacement child and then explaining to friends and family that she wasn’t Natalie; that we had left Natalie in China because she was too damaged; that the deal had been a healthy baby, and she wasn’t. How could I face myself? How could I ever forget? I would always wonder what happened to Natalie. [MUSIC PLAYING] I knew this was my test, my life’s worth distilled into a moment. I was shaking my head no before they finished explaining. We didn’t want another baby, I told them. We wanted our baby, the one sleeping right over there. She’s our daughter, I said. We love her. Yet we had a long, fraught night ahead wondering how we would possibly cope. I called my mother in tears and told her the news. There was a long pause. ‘Oh, honey.’ I sobbed. She waited until I caught my breath. ‘It would be OK if you came home without her.’ ‘Why are you saying that?’ ‘I just want to absolve you. What do you want to do?’ ‘I want to take my baby and get out of here,’ I said. ‘Good,’ my mother said. ‘Then that’s what you should do.’” I mean, I’m tearing up. Me, too. So the lesson in this piece to me is about a test. It’s really a test. It’s like, what are you capable of? Like, what kind of devotion? What kind of sense of responsibility? What are you going to take on? And they have to decide in the moment, are they going to stick with this child with this horrifying set of health complications that could control their lives forever, or are they going to push that baby aside and accept a healthier baby? And then, how do they live with themselves if they do that? Neither choice is an appealing choice. No. This essay — I mean, all of these essays bowled me over, and this one just made me — I mean, I quite literally called my mom after this. It is such a moving [SIGHS]: testament to just the completely inexplicable, immediate bond between parent and child. Yeah, I’m still crying. I mean, it’s remarkable. Tell me what you’re taking — I mean, you are a parent. Tell me what you’re thinking about when you read this essay. Well, first of all, I think anyone reading this thinks, what choice would I have made? Of course. And you would like to think that you would make the choice of keeping the child. But honestly, one of the most moving things and tragic things that happened in the wake of publishing this essay is we got emails from people who had faced this choice and — Wow. — made the opposite choice and either left with a healthy baby and struggled and struggled and struggled with having done that. More common was giving up on adoption entirely and just walking away, and walking away from that child or any child. But she’s just like, I’m going to walk into this. I’m going to just walk forward into this, and it’s going to be what it’s going to be. And miracle of miracles, within a year or so, all that stuff has gone away. They see a specialist. I know. The kid is fine. I’m going to cry again. It’s like after making this decision, they go home, and she heals. Oh. Yeah. And she recoiled at thinking that was a reward for making the right choice. She said, it’s not about that. It’s not about, we were generous, or we were good, and therefore, our child turned out fine. It’s not that at all. It just happened that way. But it’s yet another lesson in you can’t predict the smooth path. You just have to walk forward and be brave. I often say with “Modern Love” stories that are really about choices and hard choices and how it’s ordinary people being incredibly brave, I mean, I often wonder what creates the person who can make the brave choice versus the person who shrinks from it? Like, what is that magic sauce? Or what is that childhood experience? Or what is the parenting that they have? Totally. Because there is a divide. There is a divide often in those circumstances that we saw in the outpouring after the essay. We see instances of bravery in all three of the essays that you’ve shared today — bravery to embrace the brevity of love, bravery to engage in fighting in a relationship, bravery to make a choice. Would you define bravery as like a core act of love? Yeah, a core act of love and a core act of life. People’s bravery has been my biggest takeaway over 20 years of doing this work. It’s never a person who says, I am brave. It’s almost the opposite. It’s people who say, I’m not brave. I’m a coward. And yet — Totally. — and just the lesson of that, life — it’s going to be a mess one way or the other. You just choose your mess. But that is what it is. That is life. You’re not going to avoid it. There’s such a school of life that is about trying to make your life as clean and tidy as possible. And it’s really a struggle to do that. And I’m not sure it’s well-directed energy. [CHUCKLES] What do you think we should direct our energy to? And now this is just truly me asking you because I want you to give me life advice — if not to cleaning up our life. Well, no, I’m not an advice giver, Anna. I know, but just please — You should know that. — put on the hat for one second. Like, if not to direct our energy towards cleaning up our life in your 20 years of doing this work, what is the more worthwhile thing to direct energy towards? This is not exactly new advice, but it’s really the wisdom from Alisha Gorder’s essay, which is, be in the moment. Value the people you’re with now. Don’t think I’m planning for 10 years from now. Get your 401(k) out of your mind. Contribute to it, but put it out of your mind. It’s the now. It’s the now. That is the work. Dan I love that. It’s the now. I feel like so many listeners right now are clinging to every word you’ve said, trying to figure out what you’re looking for in a “Modern Love” essay pitch. And by the way, you can send those submissions to ModernLove@nytimes.com. Dan, can you give us a few quick tips on what makes a story stand out in your inbox? Well, a bad subject line is “Modern Love Submission.” You’re like 80 percent of people who submit. And a good subject line would include an attempt at a title, which would be like, “Please, Lord, Let Him Be 27.” Please, Lord. Yeah. I read that subject line. It was funny. It was smart. It was vulnerable. I just prayed the essay would deliver on that promise. And it did deliver. We actually featured it on the podcast a few seasons ago. So a good subject line is very practical advice, but what about the essence of a story? What are you looking for there? Harder to define. Quality is a sense of humility. There’s a sense that you’re not the smartest person in the world, but you do have something to offer. And in the world of pitching and of trying to get published, there’s an overriding sense that you have to act confident. You have to sell your product. You have to say, this essay is going to be perfect for you. And that’s just the wrong approach. That kind of confidence is not what a hard experience leaves you with. It can leave you shaken. It can leave you wise. But it doesn’t leave you cocky. And I think it’s important that the stories aren’t really about answers. They’re about a search for answers. And they don’t need to come to a conclusion, but they need to present a problem in an interesting way that makes you think about it. Well, now you’re going to get even more submissions that can fuel the next 20 years of “Modern Love.” Dan, thank you so much for the conversation today. Thanks, Anna. That was a lot of fun.

Why Am I So Tired All the Time?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/well/mind/fatigue-and-sleepiness-causes.html,"Ask Well Chronic exhaustion is pretty common, but it’s also treatable. Credit...Eric Helgas for The New York Times Supported by ByAnna Gibbs Q: I get plenty of sleep, but I’m always tired. What’s going on? Figuring out why you’re tired often requires a little detective work, said Dr. Shannon Sullivan, a sleep medicine specialist at Stanford University. On the one hand, your sleep routine might just need a few tweaks. But certain health conditions or medications could also be to blame. The good news, Dr. Sullivan said, is there are ways to identify and treat the source of your fatigue, which can often help you feel better. “It’s a part of medicine with a great deal of hope,” she said. The first thing you should do isreview your sleep habits, Dr. Sullivan said. Have you recently strayed from your normal sleep schedule? Have you been stressed? If not, your sleep routine might need some sprucing. Make sure you’re getting at least seven hours of sleep every night (some people need more) and try to go to bed and wake up at the same times every day. Much like a toddler’s naps, your own sleep will be better when it’s consistent, Dr. Sullivan said. If you have a regular afternoon coffee or an evening glass of wine, try skipping it. And avoid scrolling on your phone or snacking just before bed. All of these activities can lower the quality of your sleep. Thetiming of your mealscan make a difference, too; aim to finish dinner at least two to three hours before bedtime. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

How Long Do Leftovers Last?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/well/eat/how-long-do-thanksgiving-leftovers-last.html,"Ask Well Here’s how to extend the life of your Thanksgiving turkey — or any meal — without getting sick. Credit...Eric Helgas for The New York Times Supported by ByAlice Callahan Q: I enjoy Thanksgiving leftovers even more than the meal on the big day. How long are they safe to eat? Benjamin Chapman, a professor of food safety at North Carolina State University, takes Thanksgiving — and leftovers — seriously. This year, he said, his family’s feast will include a 24-pound turkey raised by a local 4-H participant, along with the traditional sides. Then, he added, they won’t cook again for days. “We’ll be like sloths, and everybody will just go heat something up in the microwave.” Dr. Chapman studies food safety for a living, so he has thought carefully about how to make leftovers last. We asked him and other experts for their best tips on this, so everyone can continue to enjoy the spoils of their labor. According tofederal guidelines, most refrigerated leftovers — including cooked turkey; gravy; traditional sides like stuffing, mashed potatoes and green beans; and desserts like pumpkin pie — should be consumed within three to four days. So by the Monday after Thanksgiving, those foods should be gone or in the freezer. Even so,there are exceptions. Fruit pies can be kept for one to two days at room temperature, or for a week in the refrigerator. Packaged breads and rolls are good for 14 to 18 days at room temperature, and homemade bread for up to five days. Homemade cranberry sauce can be kept in the refrigerator for seven to 10 days; the canned version will last one to two weeks. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Why Do My Ears Hurt on Planes?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/well/clogged-ears-on-planes.html,"Ask Well “Airplane ear” can muffle hearing and make your ears feel clogged. Here’s why, and how to avoid it. Credit...Eric Helgas for The New York Times Supported by ByKatie Mogg Katie Mogg spoke with seven otolaryngologists to understand airplane ear, something she has had twice this year. Q: Sometimes my ears hurt during flights. Why does this happen, and what can I do about it? When you fly thousands of feet above ground, the changes in cabin pressure can be downright unpleasant — causing potential issues likeabdominal bloating, headaches and yes, earaches. “Airplane ear” is an umbrella term for a variety of symptoms caused by rapid changes in altitude and air pressure, said Dr. David Gudis, an otolaryngologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia. For some people, it’s no more than a clogged feeling that temporarily muffles hearing. For others, the condition may cause intense pain and even damage the ear drum. “The good news is that it generally resolves on its own,” Dr. Gudis said. “It can just be very uncomfortable until it does.” This can take anywhere from seconds to days, he added. In the space behind your eardrum, or the middle ear, is a structure called the Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat. The Eustachian tube is responsible for keeping the air pressure between the middle ear and the environment the same. Keeping air pressure balanced is “something we don’t normally have to think about,” said Dr. Esther X. Vivas, a professor of otolaryngology at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. We can usually do it by yawning or swallowing, which contracts muscles that open the Eustachian tube, experts said. But when the air pressure changes quickly during a flight, it can be hard for the Eustachian tube to “keep up,” Dr. Gudis said. This can make us feel that we need to yawn or “pop our ears” to force the tube open so air can pass through, said Dr. Gregory Levitin, an otolaryngologist at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.

Are Hot Showers Bad for Your Skin and Hair?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/well/are-hot-showers-bad.html,"Ask Well Most dermatologists agree that a steaming-hot shower can dry out your hair and skin. Here’s what the research says. Credit...Joyce Lee for The New York Times Supported by ByKatie Mogg Q: I love taking hot showers, but I’ve heard they can damage your skin and hair. Is that true? It’s no secret that a hot shower can be relaxing: It can soothe sore muscles and joints, improve your mood, and help you sleep better. “There are benefits to warmer showers or baths, so I don’t want to discount that,” said Dr. Victoria Barbosa, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Chicago. But, she added, “none of those benefits are for your skin.” The research on how hot water affects our skin and hair is thin, dermatologists said, but most experts agree that scorching showers may strip away oils and moisture-retaining substances. Generally, it’s best to take lukewarm showers, experts said. “A hot bath or shower should be a treat, not a daily occurrence,” Dr. Barbosa said. When it comes to the effects of bathing on skin health, research largely focuses on the use of cleansers. There aren’t many studies exploring water temperature, said Dr. Blair Jenkins, a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at Michigan Medicine.But dermatologists said hot water, especially when combined with soaps that contain fragrances and harsh ingredients, may damage the outermost layer, known as the skin barrier. The skin barrier is made of dead skin cells, said Dr. Paola Baker, a dermatologist in Boston who has researchedits function. Surrounding those cells is a dense matrix of fatty substances such as ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol, she said. These substances, called lipids, help retain moisture in the skin and protect it from environmental irritants and allergens. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Do I Really Need to Throw Out My Black Plastic Spatula?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/well/black-plastic-health.html,"Ask Well A new study detected dangerous chemicals in a variety of household items. But experts say the health risks aren’t clear-cut. Credit...Tonje Thilesen for The New York Times Supported by ByEmily Schmall Q: I have a few black plastic kitchen utensils in my drawer, but I’ve read that they’re dangerous. Is that true? Recent headlines have urged people to immediately throw out any black plastic items lying around their homes, warning that they could contain toxic chemicals. Astudy publishedin October in the journal Chemosphere spurred many of these reports. It found that some of these items — including spatulas, sushi takeout trays and children’s toys — could shed flame retardants. But whether they pose a risk to your health is a more complex question. Previous studies have shown that flame retardants can seep out of plastics, especially when heated. While exposure to high levels of these chemicals has been linked to serious health effects, it’s not clear how much any one household item increases risk. Manufacturers started adding flame retardants to products like TV sets and computers in the 1970s to slow the spread of fire. But companies have had to phase them out as studies over the past two decades have shown that they are toxic and could be cancerous to animals and humans at high levels of exposure. Some of these chemicals, however, have resurfaced in plastic household items made from recycled electronic waste, since the regulations thatreined in the useof certain flame retardants did not apply to such materials. The fact that the banned chemicals have appeared in household products shows that they “can bite us a second time if we’re not careful,” said Joseph Allen, a professor of environmental health at Harvard University who has studied the health risks of flame retardants.

She Invested in Her Future and Her Family. Which Property Would Work for Both?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/12/realestate/bronx-dobbs-ferry-connecticut-home.html,"The Hunt for … Advertisement The Hunt ByColette ColemanDec. 12, 2024 Seeking an income-generating home and a place for her brother to potentially live, a New Yorker scanned the Bronx, Westchester and southern Connecticut for the perfect spot. Tabitha Jones can’t sit still. A compliance director for a financial firm, she has also coached volleyball, led wellness retreats, hosted pop-up luxury picnics and made a real estate career in the Bronx and lower Westchester County, N.Y. Ms. Jones, 38, didn’t intend to become a part-time real estate agent, but when she bought her first property in Westchester County a decade ago — a home for herself, her mother and her younger brother — everyone was so impressed with her diligence on the deal that they urged her to consider being the agent next time. [Did you recently buy a home? We want to hear from you. Email:thehunt@nytimes.com] Always professionally curious, she took on an administrative role at a brokerage in White Plains, N.Y., on weekends. Since getting her license in 2016 and joining Keller Williams as an agent, she has worked mostly with first-time buyers, friends and acquaintances. Now an experienced investor and agent, she enjoys teaching others. “She just wants to elevate,” said her brother, Christian Jones, 30. Ms. Jones recently started a real estate investing club with a group of like-minded friends, all 35-to-40-year-old Afro-Latina women from the Bronx looking to invest in their home borough, which she believes is “the next big thing.” “There are going to be investors coming in, and they’re going to start taking over the neighborhoods,” she said. “Why can’t we be those investors?” Her goal is to own five properties. To reach it, she said, “you need to be willing to sacrifice.” She’s grateful to have a job in the finance industry (and her side gigs), and she doesn’t spend money on clothes, shoes or gadgets. Her phone is a hand-me-down, and she wouldn’t replace her car until “the wheels literally fell off.” Last year, Ms. Jones wanted to purchase her third property, ideally in the Bronx or nearby, which her brother could potentially occupy. He’d been living in a rental in the borough, finding himself after their father’s death, unsure of his next move. For the longer term, she sought a solid investment property that would be easy to rent out and could be a flexible asset, so she looked at everything from condos to multifamily homes to small mixed-use buildings. “I’m always looking,” Ms. Jones said. “I’m always in that head space.” Among her options: No. 1 Stamford Condo at Auction Ms. Jones couldn’t visit this condo in a big building in Stamford, Conn., which had been listed on Auction.com. She could see that it was bank-owned and vacant and allowed financing. And she knew it had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a big kitchen and in-unit laundry. There were photos of the building’s exterior, the living room and one bathroom. She wasn’t sure if the photos were recent, nor was there clear information on any needed renovations. She was willing to bid up to $350,000, accounting for Auction.com’s 8 percent fee and the possibility of repairs. Annual property taxes were about $8,900. No. 2 Bronx Two-Bedroom Co-op When one of Ms. Jones’s former clients asked her to list this 900-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath co-op in a prewar complex in the Pelham Parkway area, Ms. Jones asked if she’d be willing to sell it to her. Listed at $240,000, it was in good condition with great light, city views and a nice layout with the bedrooms on opposite sides. The sixth-floor apartment had a bar area separating the kitchen from the living room, ideal for hosting. By renting it out, she could cover her expenses, and she thought the proximity to the subway would make it appealing to tenants. Maintenance was $904 a month. No. 3 Dobbs Ferry Fixer-Upper This 3,000-square-foot mixed-use building in the Westchester village of Dobbs Ferry had a ground-level storefront and two rental units above, all vacant. One was a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment, perfect for Mr. Jones, and the other was a three-bedroom, one-bath unit. Ms. Jones loved the vibe in town, and with her event-planning experience, she was excited about the possibility of opening a community bookstore-cafe in the storefront. The $749,000 asking price was much higher than the other two options, and the building needed significant work — but it could be renovated to the owner’s tastes. Annual property taxes were listed at about $17,000. Find out what happened next by answering these two questions: Which Would You Choose?

Two San Francisco Renters Fled the City for a Quieter Life. Would They Find It in Sonoma or Marin?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/05/realestate/sonoma-marin-county-california-home-sale.html,"The Hunt for … Advertisement The Hunt ByMark KreidlerDec. 5, 2024 Seeking city-style activities in a small-town setting, a young couple headed north out of San Francisco in search of a sunny place with character, preferably for less than $1 million. Here’s what they found. Nearly a decade as renters didn’t dampen Alexandra Andorfer and George Croton’s love of San Francisco. They made the most of their 950 square feet, even finding ways to grow their family — now with two dogs and two cats — in their two-bedroom just off Buena Vista Park, near the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. But several years spent enjoying food-and-wine weekends with friends in the bucolic Sonoma Valley, about 50 miles north, inspired another possibility: Could the couple leave the city and find enough of what they loved about it in a small-town setting? [Did you recently buy a home? We want to hear from you. Email:thehunt@nytimes.com] It was, in part, a question of background. While Ms. Andorfer, 33, had mostly grown up in big cities (Pittsburgh and Baltimore) and attended college in Chicago, Mr. Croton, 32, was a product of Santa Barbara, Calif., and its rambling ambience. “Santa Barbara has that kind of ‘small city, large town’ thing going on,” he said. “It’s very beautiful, lots of outdoor stuff, but also lots of amenities and restaurants and fun things to do.” Mr. Croton was warmer to the idea of leaving San Francisco, where the couple met in law school. Both of their jobs as attorneys were in the Bay Area, though each could telecommute several days a week, leaving room to imagine a different way of living. And Ms. Andorfer was somewhat surprised to find how much she looked forward to their getaways, especially to the town of Sonoma, a foodie haven with 11,000 residents set in the vibrant heart of Sonoma Valley wine country. “I very quickly could see myself living there,” she said. “It doesn’t have city vibes, but it has restaurants and culture — a lot of things going on. I love to cook and I’m in a bunch of wine clubs, including several right in that area.” It was Ms. Andorfer who suggested visiting some open houses in Sonoma — “just for fun,” she said. Mr. Croton added a wrinkle when he proposed including Marin County, about 30 miles south of Sonoma, with its coveted combination of rural feel and higher-end amenities. At an open house in Marin County, the couple met Kristen Perry, an agent with the Kristie Martinelli Team at Coldwell Banker who previously was an executive at several tech startups. “It’s always interesting when people leave the city,” Ms. Perry said. “Some take a very long time to get to the point of actually being ready to move. But Alex and George moved very quickly once they realized that they felt pretty sure about it.” The couple scouted open houses for weeks, looking for a place with an airy feel and distinctive architecture. They hoped to remain within walking distance of shops and services, as they were in San Francisco, and wanted either a big yard or park access for their pets. With some help from Mr. Croton’s mother for a down payment, they capped their budget at $1.35 million. Among their options: No. 1 Three-Bedroom Ranch in Sonoma This three-bedroom, two-bath house in Sonoma, built in 1979, had a beautifully updated kitchen and lots of natural light. Its 1,833 square feet, finished with bamboo flooring and plantation shutters, sat on nearly a quarter acre. There was an attached two-car garage, and an expansive deck and garden shed took up much of the backyard. The house sat on one of Sonoma’s main streets, necessitating a fully fenced front yard. The road noise bothered Mr. Croton more than it did Ms. Andorfer. It was listed at $949,000, with estimated annual taxes of $11,000. No. 2 Woodsy A-Frame in Marin County Set on a narrow road in the Fairfax hills, this updated two-bedroom, two-bath 1967 house with vaulted ceilings and skylights backed up to forest, creek and hiking trails in Marin County’s Cascade Canyon Preserve. A chef’s kitchen and big skylights made it feel bigger than its 1,572 square feet, and the couple loved the glass doors that opened out to a big back deck surrounded by old-growth trees and views of the hills. There was virtually no storage (it had a carport but no garage), and the home’s tucked-in location meant longer drives to the city than its location suggested. It was priced at $1.195 million, with estimated annual taxes of $10,000. No. 3 Walk Down the Hill to Sonoma This 1,915-square-foot house in Sonoma had three bedrooms, three bathrooms and an open-plan living area. The living room, which had vaulted ceilings, opened onto a wraparound deck with custom shading and forever views of the Sonoma Valley. Perched near the top of a narrow road of residences, it felt a bit isolated, yet Ms. Andorfer found a coffee shop and other amenities within a few minutes’ walk down the hill. Built in 1978, the house needed some upgrades, including backyard fencing, new kitchen appliances and, most pressing, a new roof. There was an attached two-car garage. It was listed for $995,000, with estimated annual taxes of $9,500. Find out what happened next by answering these two questions: Which Would You Choose?

BrownNov. 28, 2024 Forced out of their two-bedroom rental by a new landlord, a young couple looked to downsize in Park Slope or Clinton Hill. Here’s what they found. Earlier this year, Abbie Lin and Shaman Kothari were faced with a conundrum. A new owner had taken over their apartment building in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, and was refusing to renew the leases of any of the tenants. “We never thought buying a place would be something that would happen for us,” said Ms. Lin, 32. “But our hand was kind of forced.” In March, with only a few months left on their lease, the couple examined their finances to figure out what they could afford. “We moved pretty quickly when we realized we could buy something and had to move out by June,” said Mr. Kothari, 32. [Did you recently buy a home? We want to hear from you. Email:thehunt@nytimes.com] Eager to get up to speed on the process, they signed up for a first-time home buyer “boot camp” hosted by Nikki Thomas, a broker at Corcoran who eventually became their agent. “These seminars are to prepare people for the buying process but also help them figure out whether or not they’re ready to buy in the first place,” Ms. Thomas said. “Abbie and Shaman had the best energy and attitude. Buying can be exhausting. It can take a certain amount of emotional stamina.” Ms. Lin and Mr. Kothari loved Prospect Heights and limited their search to that neighborhood and the ones directly around it. Both work in marketing in the tech industry and knew that they wanted manageable commutes into Manhattan. “We were kind of spoiled for train access in our neighborhood,” he said. They settled on a budget of $800,000, looking for something convenient and pet-friendly. “Our dog passed away earlier this year,” Ms. Lin said. “But we love dogs so much and know we want another one.” Most important, they needed to be flexible about their space expectations. The couple’s rental was a two-bedroom, which made things easier on days when they both worked from home. “At first we were hopeful we could find a similar space within our budget,” Ms. Lin said. “But we realized we would have to downsize.” Among their options: No. 1 Two Balconies in Clinton Hill This loftlike one-bedroom, one-bath condo near the border of Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant came with two private balconies and a minimalist, industrial interior. The railroad-style unit had an open floor plan, floor-to-ceiling windows, wide-plank white oak flooring and a washer-dryer. The brand-new eight-unit building offered a shared roof deck with 360-degree views, and the A and C subway lines were two blocks away. The asking price was $799,000, with monthly taxes and maintenance totaling $991. No. 2 Duplex Co-op in Park Slope This one-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath co-op unit in Park Slope had bay windows overlooking Seventh Avenue, a wood-burning fireplace, in-unit laundry and an updated kitchen with stainless steel appliances. The large bedroom was up a spiral staircase, and another flight up was a private roof deck with Manhattan views. The pet-friendly building was two blocks from Prospect Park and was surrounded by restaurants and shops. The F and G subway lines were two avenues away. The asking price was $799,000, with monthly maintenance costs of $942. No. 3 Corner Co-op Unit on Prospect Park This one-bedroom, one-bath corner co-op unit sat directly on Prospect Park and got ample sunlight thanks to southern and western exposures and high ceilings. The renovated kitchen had a breakfast bar, and the living area opened through French doors to a bedroom with enough room for a work space. The building was pet-friendly and included a laundry room and dedicated basement storage. The F and G trains were a block away. The asking price was $750,000, with monthly maintenance costs of $844.

"She Took Her $300,000 Budget to the Washington, D.C., Area. Could She Afford Something in the City?",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/21/realestate/washington-dc-condo-sale.html,"The Hunt for … Advertisement The Hunt ByMichele LernerNov. 21, 2024 Excited to start a new government job, a young first-time buyer considered starter apartments inside and outside the Beltway. Here’s what she found. Gianna Licari has an epic Barbie collection and loves everything pink, but she’s tough when it comes to getting what she wants. The 23-year-old Chicago native graduated a year early from the University of California, Los Angeles, then set her sights on moving to the nation’s capital. “My dad was a D.E.A. agent back in the 1980s, and I always wanted to follow in his footsteps working in government,” Ms. Licari said. At first, she worked remotely from her parents’ Chicago home to save money. “I couldn’t kick down doors,” she said, “but my first job was in the F.D.A.’s Office of Ethics and Integrity.” In July 2023, she was excited to move east for a new job with the government, even though she didn’t know anyone in the Washington, D.C., area. Her first priority: figuring out how she could buy a place rather than overpay for a local rental. She set her budget at $300,000, but was primarily focused on keeping monthly payments under $2,500. [Did you recently buy a home? We want to hear from you. Email:thehunt@nytimes.com] “Inventory for anything in that price range was really low in the fall of 2023, and it’s still low,” said Chris Kuchnicki, an agent with the Keri Shull Team at eXp Realty in Arlington, Va. “Anything you can find usually sells fast.” Since Ms. Licari doesn’t own a car, transportation options and walkability were important. She looked for listings within a 10-minute walk of Metro stations throughout the region. “To find something I could afford, I looked farther and farther away from the city in Maryland and Virginia,” she said. “I didn’t love the idea of an hourlong commute, but I also was determined to buy rather than waste money on rent.” She planned to use her savings and her salary to finance a purchase, and didn’t want to ask her parents for help with the down payment. “Gianna seemed like a prime candidate for first-time home buyer assistance programs, so I had her send her paperwork to a lender qualified with those programs,” Mr. Kuchnicki said. “A lot of people aren’t aware that they can qualify for home buyer assistance. The income limits are higher than they realize.” In the end, the search came down to three condos. No. 1 Two-Bedroom in Rockville, Md. This 1,053-square-foot condo had two bedrooms and two bathrooms, so Ms. Licari could have a separate space for a home office. The open-plan unit came with wall-to-wall carpeting, a washer-dryer and a balcony with interior views. The 1971 building was a five-minute walk from Rockville Town Center, which offered plenty of shops and restaurants, as well as from the Red Line Metro (the ride into Washington took just under an hour). The apartment needed some work, and the $1,230 monthly HOA fee was high. The asking price was $225,000, with annual taxes of about $2,120. No. 2 One-Bedroom in Washington, D.C. At 560 square feet, this condo in Washington’s Navy Yard neighborhood was the smallest place Ms. Licari considered. The compact bedroom had a barn door and a transom window into the living area, and the large bathroom had a stacked washer-dryer. The new 171-unit building, which offered amenities including a rooftop pool, was adjacent to the Metro station and a block from the Washington Nationals’ baseball stadium, with lots of bars and restaurants around. Ms. Licari liked the area but was a little worried about noise at night. The asking price was $240,200, with a monthly HOA fee of $242 and annual taxes of $1,617. No. 3 One-Bedroom in Vienna, Va. This updated one-bedroom, one-bath unit with about 740 square feet was in a condo complex in Vienna, Va., about an hour west of Washington. The apartment came with an office nook for Ms. Licari’s desk, new heating and air-conditioning systems, new flooring and a covered balcony overlooking a courtyard. The complex offered a pool, a gym and a media room, and was right across the street from a Metro station (but it was the last stop on the line). The asking price was $294,000, with a monthly HOA fee of $389 and annual taxes of $3,081. Find out what happened next by answering these two questions: Which Would You Choose?

Do I Have to Tell My Boyfriend I’ve Been Paid for Sex?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/magazine/sex-work-boyfriend-ethics.html,"Advertisement Subscriber-onlyNewsletter The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on the kinds of information romantic partners deserve to know about one another’s pasts. ByKwame Anthony Appiah Years ago, when I was struggling with addiction, I would occasionally (once a month or less) engage in sex work to help make ends meet. This was voluntary — no one made me do anything I didn’t want to do — but it’s still uncomfortable for me to think about sometimes. I always used protection during these encounters and continue to get screened for S.T.D.s regularly. If anything, I think I’m slightly less likely than the general population is to pass anything on. I’m in a new relationship that’s starting to get serious. He knows about my past issues with addiction. Do I have to disclose the fact that I used to be a sex worker? He’s been very accepting about everything up to this point, but as a woman I’m aware that there’s so much social stigma around sex work that I think there’s a chance he might end the relationship if he knew about this. Even if he didn’t end the relationship immediately, I imagine it would make him incredibly uncomfortable. I really don’t want to ruin a good relationship over something that ended five or six years before we met. But I feel as if I’m keeping something important from him. Exactly how much about my sexual past does my current partner have a right to know? For that matter, what about anyone I might date in the future? Twenty years from now, is this still something I need to disclose?— Name Withheld From the Ethicist: The stigma around sex work you mention is real enough, and has multiple sources. Part of it is surely a spillover from times when people thought all extramarital sex was wrong. And then, for many, sexual intimacy has a special kind of significance, such that engaging in it for any reason other than as an expression of desire is upsetting. Some negative associations, too, arise from the fact that much sex work is not fully consensual, even though the wrong there is done to, and not by, the sex worker. Despite the medical facts you mention, concerns about disease can merge with inchoate notions of moral pollution: The sex worker is seen as tainted, contaminating the social body. These perceptions are highly gendered. Women’s sexuality has traditionally been far more strictly regulated than men’s. That’s why there’s no male equivalent of the ‘‘fallen woman,’’ and nobody talks about ‘‘easy men.’’ Recent fictional, and autofictional, depictions suggest that these patterns persist. When the novelist Justin Torres writes about male sex work, there’s little sense of it as character-defining or tragic; it’s one of the curious odd jobs you might take to get by. By contrast, it weighs heavily on the human rights lawyer in Sally Rooney’s latest novel that his girlfriend has been ‘‘borderline what you might call a sex worker.’’ Social stigmas are readily internalized, so you’ll want to come to grips with your own discomfort. I hope it comes from your having put yourself in the situation where you did something you feel you can’t freely talk about — and not because you see yourself as a sexual sinner. Thinking all this through will help you get a handle on what your own attitude is and should be; it doesn’t settle what you owe to your partner. Most people today don’t expect a partner to reveal details of their earlier sexual lives. This doesn’t mean there aren’t things about your sexual past that partners would feel they ought to have been told. If your partner would be upset by learning about your sex work, you can assume that this is one of the things he wouldn’t want withheld from him. Yet that’s not the same thing as his having the right to know. Most people have done things in their past that they’d rather keep to themselves. You don’t have a duty to announce them all when you enter a serious relationship. And if, with the passage of years, this episode in your life recedes in significance for you, so would the rationale for discussing it. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

A Guy I Know Had a Liver Transplant. Now He’s Boozing Again.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/magazine/liver-transplant-alcohol-ethics.html,"Advertisement Subscriber-onlyNewsletter The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on how to support someone with an addiction problem. ByKwame Anthony Appiah My significant other has a friend who is a longtime alcoholic, while also being intelligent, entertaining and conniving. For example, he used to tell his wife he was going to the gym and then head to the bar; before returning home, he’d dampen his clothes in the bathroom to make it seem as if he’d gotten a good sweat on. He was off the radar for a bit, and then we learned he had a liver transplant. After that, he had an episode of hepatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder caused by liver dysfunction. It seems the doctors knew he was still drinking but gave him the new liver anyway and counseled abstinence. A few parties later, he was sneaking vodka, gin and whatever else was around. He lies to everyone and has made his guy friends vow not to tell his wife about his drinking. They’ve made a meager attempt to confront him, only to be assured that he just fell off the wagon and would be good. Just don’t tell the wife! I’m appalled that they’re going along with this. There are a couple of ethical issues here. First, who should decide whether someone is entitled to a transplant? Some hospital systems deny a liver transplant to patients who continue to drink alcohol, and other hospitals don’t. Second, do the friends have an obligation to tell this man’s wife that he’s still drinking? She could insist he leave the house and go to rehab, in which case he might have a chance of living long enough to see his children get married. Some additional context: A friend of mine died waiting for a liver transplant. I am also the child of a lifelong alcoholic.— Name Withheld From the Ethicist: There’s more than one morally defensible way of allocating donor organs. In the United States, as in Western Europe, the system emphasizes equity and basically gives priority to patients with the greatest need. An approach that focused instead on efficiency — on getting the maximum use out of donated livers, as measured by ‘‘quality-adjusted life years’’ — might give an edge to people who were younger and otherwise healthier and might work against low-income and minority populations. Organ allocation in the United States is governed by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (O.P.T.N.), whose policies determine the order in which deceased-donor organs are offered; they do not, however, dictate medical practice. So it’s up to a medical center to decide whether or not transplant candidates with alcohol-related liver disease are to abstain from alcohol for some period — six months having long been a typical sobriety window. Some studies indicate that carefully selected patients who aren’t subject to a sobriety window can do just as well as those who are (though the data is hard to interpret because of the ‘‘carefully selected’’ part). And if your drinking has caused a severe case of acute hepatitis that doesn’t respond to medical treatment, you probably won’t survive a six-month waiting period. So the trend seems to be away from requiring an extended interval of abstinence. The point is that the current system for allocating this scarce resource is morally legitimate, whatever trade-offs it may entail; its architects are perfectly aware that many liver recipients will not succeed in refraining from heavy drinking afterward. The fact that this longtime alcoholic has returned to his old habits is distressing. It doesn’t mean that the system isn’t functioning the way it’s meant to. One thing that transplant centers may try to determine is whether patients with an alcohol problem have social networks that could help them stay sober. This brings us to your second question. This fellow’s friends weren’t looking after him when they agreed to uphold this boozy bro code and keep mum. He doesn’t want to die, but he’s drinking himself to death, which means that, at least in this key area, he lacks the capacity for rational decision-making. In a situation like that, it’s more important to attend to his interests than to respect his autonomy. If there’s a chance that his life can be extended by successful management of his alcoholism, and if discussing the problem with his wife will help, thoughtful friends would do just that.

Is It Fair to Judge a Friend by the Way She Voted?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/magazine/best-friend-selfish-trump-ethics.html,"Advertisement Subscriber-onlyNewsletter The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on friendship, suspicion and character assessment. ByKwame Anthony Appiah My best friend and I grew up in moderate-conservative households. While I became more progressive as I aged, she grew more conservative. In the past, we were able to have heated conversations and remain on good terms. Now I fear asking whom she voted for, suspecting that it was Trump. While I respect traditional Republican values, I believe Trump supporters are bad and selfish. My questions are: 1) Is it ethical to automatically characterize my friend as a bad and selfish person for potentially voting for him? And 2) Is it ethical to investigate whom my friend voted for just so I can get her to change her mind?— Name Withheld From the Ethicist: Assuming that yourfriend did support Trump, you have no real idea why. Suppose she did so because she believed that democracy was in peril and wanted to protect it. You might think she was mistaken, but you couldn’t call that motive ignoble or selfish. We owe it to our friends not to believe ill of them without compelling evidence. Now, you may think that someone who considered a vote for Trump to be a vote for democracy must not have been paying attention. You may think, further, that it’s wrong to do something as important as voting without due diligence. Thatisa kind of fault, but it’s not necessarily a result of selfishness. And I wonder whether you have any reason to assume that your friend was less diligent than many Democratic voters. Finally, friends don’t ‘‘investigate’’ one another. If you have a question, ask it, and then listen. It’s at odds with the norms of friendship to have a conversation solely in order to change someone’s mind. In genuine conversation, we want to find out what our friends think and why they think it, because we care about them and their opinions. Even if you’re confident that nothing your friend says could change your view of Trump, you should certainly entertain the possibility that you will change your view of her. My 20-year-old grandson voted for Trump, despite my attempts to help him understand the threat to democracy. (While I expressed my concerns, I respected his right to vote for the candidate of his choice and was proud that he voted in his first election.) My husband shared this information with his adult children — ours is a blended family — without getting my grandson’s consent or consulting me. His family, like us, aren’t Trump supporters. I’m struggling with this breach of privacy and disrespect for our marriage. —Name Withheld From the Ethicist: Having a secretballot protects us from employers and other people with power over us, who might otherwise subject us to pressure or penalties. That’s why John Stuart Mill was wrong to oppose it. Still, he had a point to make: that every voter should consider the public good, and act as if under public scrutiny. I agree that your husband should have considered the possibility that your grandson believed that he was speaking to you in confidence. Still, you don’t indicate that your husband had reason to think this was the case. And there’s something to be said for the ideal of citizens who are willing to talk with one another about the issues and their views. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Can Voters Be Held Accountable for Their Candidate’s Behavior?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/magazine/trump-voters-considered-traitors-ethics.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Subscriber-onlyNewsletter The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on voter responsibility. ByKwame Anthony Appiah From my perspective, the attack on the Capitol spurred on by Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, the efforts to nullify the results of the 2020 election with false electors and unfounded court cases and the persistent effort to discredit those election results without evidence amounted to an attempt to overthrow a pillar of our democracy. More to the point, 18 U.S. Code Chapter 115 includes crimes against the nation described as treason, misprision of treason, rebellion or insurrection, seditious conspiracy and advocating the overthrow of government. I hold anyone voting for Trump at least morally guilty for the consequences of Jan. 6 and everything that follows the recent election. Would you agree that people who vote for Trump in light of these circumstances are themselves guilty of treasonous acts?— Name Withheld From the Ethicist: Something like three-quarters of Americans, surveys over the past year report, think democracy in America is threatened. To go by exit-poll data, those voters supported Trump in about the same proportions as those who thought democracy was secure. In a study published last year, researchers at U.C. Berkeley and M.I.T. provided evidence that democratic back-sliding around the world — with citizens voting for authoritarian leaders — is driven in part by voters who believe in democracy but doubt that the other side does. The researchers found that such voters, once shown the actual levels of support for democracy among their opponents, became less likely to vote for candidates who violated democratic norms. The general point is that not understanding the actual views of people of other parties — and assuming the worst of them — can be dangerous for democracy. Trump voters, for the most part, don’t think he committed treason. And your position can’t be that unknowingly voting for someone guilty of treason is itself treasonous. Perhaps you think that they should believe him to have been treasonous. Similar issues were aired when Henry Wallace, otherwise a highly dissimilar figure, ran for president in 1948. He had denounced the Marshall Plan, wanted the Soviet Union to play a role in the governance of Germany’s western industrial heartland and — detractors thought — was a Stalin apologist. Historians can debate whether he was a voice of conscience or a pawn of America’s adversaries. But suppose you were among those who viewed him as a traitor. To have extended the indictment to his supporters would have been to criminalize political disagreement. Besides, if voting for someone who has done bad things makes you guilty of them, most voters are in deep trouble. It’s easy to be inflamed by someone with a habit of making inflammatory statements. But there may be a cost when you deem those who vote for the other side as ‘‘the enemy from within.’’ That’s a term that Trump has freely employed, of course. You’ll want to ask yourself whether protecting democracy is best served by adopting this attitude. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Am I a Hypocrite for Calling Donald Trump a Liar?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/magazine/hypocrisy-trump-liar-ethics.html,"Advertisement Subscriber-onlyNewsletter The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on hypocrisy. ByKwame Anthony Appiah My Trump-supporter friends understand that he’s a liar and adulterer but adamantly defend him with reasoning like ‘‘Everyone lies — have you not lied before?’’ or ‘‘My dad’s an extremely trustworthy guy even though he cheated on my mom a couple of times — so what?’’ I understand they are rationalizing to feel good about their candidate, but is it ethical to be hypocritical?— Name Withheld From the Ethicist: Yes, everybody lies. Still, lying about private matters, matters you think are nobody else’s business, may be quite different from lying about public matters in order to manipulate others into doing what you want. We may think of honesty as a unitary ‘‘global trait’’ — such that people are either honest across the board or not — but there’s research in moral psychology that argues otherwise. The philosopher Rachana Kamtekar, reviewing some empirical studies of honesty and other virtues, has argued that people might have ‘‘cross-situational consistency’’ if we start to think in terms of more specific traits, like ‘‘honesty with respect to property.’’ Cheating on your wife, similarly, might not indicate that you’re more likely to cheat in other ways. Maybe what your friends really mean is that, though they might have preferred a president who showed greater fidelity to the truth and to his wives, these traits are less important to them than other traits that they actively favor. What they shouldn’t commit themselves to is the position that you can’t criticize someone for doing something you have done yourself. It also seems hard to dispute that, as David Leonhardt, Ian Prasad Philbrick and Stuart A. Thompson have argued in The Times, Trump has lied on a scale that outstrips his presidential predecessors. But we can put aside the tally. Hypocrisy, in Rochefoucauld’s deathless line, is the tribute vice pays to virtue. Society would founder if we had to be blameless to stand up for the values we hold dear. The previous question was from a man caught between his mother and in-laws. He wrote: “My mother, a two-time Trump voter in Florida, has moved closer to us in a safely blue state. While I don’t know what her vote was in the 2024 presidential election, it wouldn’t have affected the outcome. I strongly oppose Trump, as do my wife and her family, who live nearby. I’m troubled by my mother’s support of someone I consider morally abhorrent and dangerous, especially when she voted in a former swing state. With the result of the 2024 election, my wife and her family are directing their understandable fury at my mother. … I’m torn. My wife and her family expect me to brook no compromise and to speak out on an issue that feels existential to them (as it does to me), but because I know that her vote here doesn’t make a difference, I have trouble feeling motivated to admonish her for her past and possibly present support of Trump. … My mother expects me to intervene and speak up for her or to encourage my wife’s family to be more civil. She sees her vote as a ‘‘personal choice’’ and doesn’t seem to believe that she should be criticized for it. Ethically, is it wrong for me to hold my tongue or to try to negotiate the peace even though I agree with the substance of my wife’s family’s position?” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

36 Hours in Venice,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/12/travel/things-to-do-venice.html,"36 Hours BySeth SherwoodDec. 12, 2024 By Seth SherwoodPhotographs by Matteo de Mayda Seth Sherwood has been writing about Italy for the Travel section since 2008. Aban on cruise ships.Restrictions on large tour groups.Entrance fees for day-trippersduring certain high-season periods. With millions of travelers annually vying to photograph Piazza San Marco, cross Rialto Bridge and experience the canal-filled city’s other famous draws, Venice is struggling to stem the tide. To minimize your impact (and discomfort), two tips. Forays to more remote neighborhoods and islands offer additional calm and turn up unexpected discoveries. Along the way, you might find upstart grand hotels, gourmet osterias, innovative new cocktail bars and a semi-secret convent garden recently opened to the public. Second, winter — with its early darkness, famous fogs and reduced crowds — provides breathing room and deepens the mysteriousness of Venice’s narrow passageways and centuries-old buildings. One upside to visiting this coming summer: an ambitious new art center,Palazzo Diedo, reopens in a restored 18th-century building in May. Chiesa del Santissimo Redentore gardens A lovely (and much-needed) green space debuted this fall when thegarden(admission 12 euros, or about $12.70) ofChiesa del Santissimo Redentore, a 16th-century church, opened to the public for the first time. Tucked behind a door in an alley called Calle dei Frati on Giudecca — a long island forming the south border of Venice proper — the newly renovated and replanted gardens are filled  with cypresses, olive groves, fruit trees, trellised vines, and hundreds of flowers and plants. In winter, the marquee attraction is the early sunset view over the Adriatic Sea. A cafe serves espresso (€4), hot chocolate (€6.50) and more. Other half-hidden gems around Giudecca areCREA, an arts complex in a boatyard with several exhibition spaces, and the boutique ofFortuny, a century-old fabric manufacturer, in a gated industrial complex. (Just ring the bell.) Chiesa del Santissimo Redentore gardens Scuola Grande di San Rocco Someone at two-year-oldIl Refettorio(translation: “The Refectory”) likes fire. Near theScuola Grande di San Rocco— a historic building filled with works by the Renaissance painter Jacopo Tintoretto — the stylishly angular and modern-minded restaurant serves several dishes featuring burned or smoked ingredients. These include steaks (from €9 per 100 grams), flambéed scallops with lumpfish roe and charred lemon (€24), and smoked sole with porcini mushrooms (€30). Fans of forest flavors might like the foamy mushroom soup larded with shaved white truffle, pork jowl and a poached egg (€28), while seafood lovers should consider grilled octopus tentacles on potato foam with droplets of tomato sauce (€28). Scuola Grande di San Rocco The Library Bar at Nolinski Venezia A pair of impressive new hotel bars are reinvigorating Venice’s cocktail scene. Centrally located in a palazzo that once held the Venice stock exchange, on Calle XXII Marzo, a street of luxury boutiques, isNolinski Venezia. The hotel contains a velvety bar lined with some 4,000 books, from “Picasso: Between Cubism and Classicism” to “Yacht Interiors.” Peruse one  with a Dandolo cocktail (chocolate-infused bourbon, white vermouth and Earl Grey tea; €25). More playful and (intentionally) 80s-kitsch, the plushExperimental Cocktail Club— housed inIl Palazzo Experimentalhotel, in the Dorsoduro neighborhood — updates the Negroni with the Monsteroni (gin, Campari, vermouth, coconut oil and a cordial of stout ale; €15). The Library Bar at Nolinski Venezia Ring the bell to visit Fortuny, a century-old fabric manufacturer on the island of Giudecca. Rodin’s Burghers of Calais at Ca’Pesaro Long before the French billionaire François Pinault made his big 21st-century real-estate acquisitions — the opulentPalazzo Grassi townhouse and the former customs house known as Punta della Dogana— to showcase his contemporary-art collection, and even before the 1950s opening ofPeggy Guggenheim’s remarkable modern art trove, the white Baroque mansion on the Grand Canal known asCa’ Pesaro(€10) was the showcase for Venice’s artistic avant-garde. Opened as a modern-art museum in 1902, it today houses a permanent collection that includes Rodin’s “The Burghers of Calais,” Klimt’s “Giuditta II” and Warhol’s Brillo Boxes, along with contemporary art. Farther down the canal,Ca’ Rezzonicomuseum (€10) occupies another aristocratic white Baroque mansion. Once home to the poet Robert Browning, the edifice today enfolds sumptuous 18th-century period rooms decorated with ceilings painted by Tiepolo and Venetian cityscape canvases by Canaletto. Rodin’s Burghers of Calais at Ca’Pesaro La Bottiglia Like croissants in Paris,cicchetti— small savory bar snacks — abound in Venice, and no one agrees who does them best. One favorite spot isAdriatico Mar, a snug wine bar on the north edge of the Dorsoduro sestiere with its own boat dock. (There is also a sidewalk entrance.) Amid beamed ceilings and antique wooden tables, devotees munch small sandwiches (€3.50 to €4.50) filled with ingredients like formadi frant cheese (with caramelized onion and grape jam) and pork shoulder (with mustard and radicchio). A five-minute walk leads to rustic-coolLa Bottiglia, where a young team assembles overstuffed focaccia sandwiches (€9), including one with porchetta, caramelized onions, pumpkin cream and gorgonzola. La Bottiglia Legatoria Polliero The scent of pulp fillsLegatoria Polliero, one of the small independent shops nearBasilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, a red-brick Franciscan church containing paintings by Bellini and Titian. Within, the artisan Anselmo Polliero presses, cuts and binds handmade paper into tiny notebooks (€8), agendas (€15), diaries (€20) and even trays. The smell shifts to leather insideDeclare, a chic showroom for minimalist monochrome wallets (€135), messenger bags (€500) and totes (€245) handmade from Florentine calf and goat skins. Legatoria Polliero The Basilica Santi Giovanni e Paolo Rather than brave the crowds of Piazza San Marco, consider Campo dei Santi Giovanni e Paolo, a picturesque square in the Castello neighborhood that is bordered by two monumental Renaissance buildings. TheScuola Grande di San Marco, once home to a religious brotherhood and now a hospital, features a dramatic white neo-classical facade and a grand interior hall (€8 to visit) with coffered ceilings, huge paintings (including some by Tintoretto’s son Domenico), displays of bygone medical devices, and thousands of centuries-old illustrated anatomical and medical books. Next door, the soaring red-brickBasilica Santi Giovanni e Paolocontains a finely detailed panel painting by Bellini (who is buried within the church) and painted ceilings by Veronese. Admission €3.50. The Basilica Santi Giovanni e Paolo Pietra Rossa Opened in 2023,Pietra Rossarestaurant shines like a beacon of epicureanism from the quiet residential Castello neighborhood. The simple space — wooden tables, checkerboard floor — belies the sophisticated kitchen, which employs Adriatic seafood, produce from the restaurant’s garden and a Japanese kamado charcoal grill to delicious effect. Starters include numerous bocòn, one-bite concoctions like a slightly cooked oyster with watermelon gel and olive oil (€6) or langoustine with pork bits and porcini mushroom (€8), while the substantial mains range from chunks of grilled amberjack in potato cream (€28) to sliced steak with roasted vegetables. Stay local with Dorona Criterio skin-contact wine (€35 per bottle) from Ca’ Savio, a peninsula in the lagoon. Pietra Rossa La Sete An impressive natural-wine scene is gathering steam in the hip Cannaregio district. Opened in 2021,La Setecontains ample wood — ceiling, shelves, chairs, tables — and some dozen wines by the glass. Outdoor heat lamps allow drinkers to enjoy the night air while sipping, say, a light, juicy red called Trallallà (€5 per glass) byAgricola La Ventawinery. New this year,Estro Pane e Vinois a bright, cheerful little bar with canal views and shelves loaded with some 200 types of wine — includingLe Guaite di Noemi Amarone(€6 per glass), an easy-drinking red Valpolicella. And for music fans,Bea Vitaoften has D.J.s animating the evenings as customers sip offerings like Bibby (€6.50), a fruit-forward white made from Vespaiola grapes. La Sete A view of the Giudecca Canal from the island of Giudecca, which offers plenty of dining, historical and cultural spots and can be reached by vaporetto. Sinagoga Levantina A dubious distinction: The word “ghetto” was first coined in Venice as a reference to the enclosed neighborhood created in 1516 to house its Jewish population. Today the Ghetto area is still home to several centuries-old synagogues, two of which can be visited with a ticket (€17) from theGhetto Veneziainformation office. TheSinagoga Spagnola(Spanish Synagogue) was designed by the 17th-century architect Baldassare Longhena — a Catholic — who also built Ca’ Pesaro and Ca’ Rezzonico. The largest Venice synagogue, it is lined with wooden benches and contains an upper gallery for women. More finely decorated, theSinagoga Levantina(Levantine Synagogue) was built over the 16th and 17th centuries and contains neo-classical stonework, hanging silver censers and an elaborately sculpted wooden pulpit. Sinagoga Levantina Santa Maria Assunta A scenic 40-minute vaporetto voyage through the lagoon islands takes you toTorcello, probably the first island to be inhabited. En route, the line 12 vaporetto passesSan Michele(a cemetery island where the composer Igor Stravinsky and the poet Ezra Pound are buried) and Murano (famous for glass-blowers) before a stop at Mazzorbo, home to the fancyVenissarestaurant and osteria. Get off atBuranoand catch line 9 to Torcello, whereSanta Maria Assunta(€5) awaits. Begun in the seventh century, the Byzantine basilica houses dazzling medieval mosaics. The soaring wall covered with mystical Last Judgment images — skulls threaded by snakes, angels in cloaks covered with eyes, the dead emerging from tombs, Christ over a river of fire — is a mesmerizing tour de force.

36 Hours in Dubai,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/05/travel/things-to-do-dubai.html,"36 Hours ByMansi ChoksiDec. 5, 2024 By Mansi ChoksiPhotographs by Katarina Premfors Mansi Choksi is a writer who has lived in Dubai for over a decade. After the discovery of oil in 1966, Dubai transformed within a single generation, constructingartificial islands visible from space, theworld’s tallest tower,gilded hotelsandindoor ski slopes. In many ways, Dubai is a carnival mirror reflection ofover-the-top luxury, including high-end outposts of famous international chefs, and futuristic constructions (like the newMuseum of the Future, complete with roaming robots). While this is the Dubai that many visitors experience, this itinerary instead adjusts that mirror to reveal some of the worlds beneath the glossy surface — in theRussian fursold in sweltering souks, the happy commotion of picnics onnight beaches, the immigrant cooking and the nostalgia of an 18th-century fishing and pearling village transformed by visions of the future. In Dubai’s skyscraper-filled financial district, life in the year 2071 is imagined inside the interactiveMuseum of the Future. The seven-story structure, which wasdesigned with the help of an algorithm, is shaped like a human eye and engraved in Arabic calligraphy. Lift off to an imagined space station in an elevator simulating commercial space travel, press a button to watch nature come to life in a digital recreation of the Amazonian rainforest, browse a DNA library of thousands of species and check out a flying school bus. If you come across aresident robot(like a penguin “flying” above, or a roving dog), wave to start an interaction. Entry, 149 dirhams, or about $40.50. Walk a short distance to theJumeirah Emirates Towerto relax among vines and palm trees atNinive, an alfresco cocktail lounge that is an urban reimagination of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. In alcoves made from brass and wood, under dancing lantern lights, settle into cushions woven in geometric Al Sadu fabric and sip a cocktail infused with tamarind (80 dirhams) while sharing a plate of za’atar chickpea dip (60 dirhams) and shisha (flavored tobacco smoked through a water pipe; 160 dirhams). The experience is something of a mix between a majlis (Arabian sitting room) and a caravanserai (the style of inns dotting land routes along the ancient Silk Road). Note that it is illegal todrink alcoholin public, but permitted in licensed restaurants, hotels and bars. A 15-minute drive south in downtown Dubai, at the Pullman Hotel, hidden behind a record store and past a dark vestibule narrower than a pair of shoulders, isHoneycomb Hi-Fi. In the dimly lit dining room, inspired by Japanese listening bars, enjoy izakaya-style dishes like seaweed salad (46 dirhams) or chicken yakitori skewers (55 dirhams) with cocktails made with Roku gin and sake (65 to 80 dirhams) to a soundtrack of sets by D.J.s from Lebanon, Egypt and Sudan. In an anteroom is an art gallery currently showingphotographsdocumenting the sound systems of the cumbia music scene in Latin America. Honeycomb Hi-Fi, inspired by Japanese listening bars, is hidden behind a record store in downtown Dubai. Coffee Museum Learn about traditional Emirati life inAl Fahidi Historical Neighborhood, an oasis of old-world charm. Wander along winding stone pathways, push open heavy teak doors into homes originally occupied by pearl merchants, climb up to wind towers with small windows that open into the canopies of trees. Stop byBayt Al Khanyar Museum(admission, 5 dirhams), which showcases a collection of ceremonial Emirati daggers. Next door, at theCoffee Museum(10 dirhams), sample Arabic coffee and browse ancient roasting and brewing tools. Explore the adjoiningAl Fahidi Souk, where vendors sell shawls, herbs, saffron, and knockoff designer bags and watches, and take in views of Dubai Creek, which is dotted with charming dhows, or sailboat taxis. Coffee Museum Take a taxi 10 minutes west to Karama, a working-class neighborhood of low-rise buildings with saris and pajamas hung to dry, and follow the aroma of ghee intoMaharaja Bhog, a multicourse, all-you-can-eat restaurant with the ambience of an Indian wedding party that specializes in vegetarian thali, a platter featuring many small dishes (59 dirhams per adult). Wash your hands in a copper bowl that is brought to your table and take in the cheerful chaos of clinking spoons, the hiss of frying oil and laughter over the hum of classical Indian music. A rotating cast of waiters appears, swinging serving bowls over your head and doling out shallow pools of chutney alongside a selection of curries, dals, roti and rice from the western Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Cinema Akil Head south toAlserkal Avenue, a cultural district where you can browse art in a cluster of warehouses that were part of a former marble factory. Look for the public art installation of makeshift shelters by the Palestinian artistDima Srouji, which is spread along the avenue (through Feb. 26). Stop by theLeila Hellergallery to see abstract paintings by the Lebanese artistMarwan Sahmarani(through Jan. 15), and explore the tantric symbolism of paintings by the Indian artistSohan Qadriat 1X1 Art Gallery (through Jan. 9). AtCinema Akil, a retro art-house cinema with mismatched couches and vintage posters, catch a screening of an international short (56 dirhams). Afterward, shop a collection of prints, film cameras and books atGulf Photo Plusand stop byNappa Dorifor gorgeous Indian leather goods. Cinema Akil Choose your dinner adventure. Dig into salmon carpaccio, yellowtail sushi and Indomie instant noodles mixed with beef chorizo at3Fils, a diner by the Jumeirah Fishing Harbor, while taking in the breeze and the view of fishing boats and Jet Skis on the water. No alcohol, no reservations (the line moves quickly); dinner for two, around 200 dirhams. Or join a river of traffic turning intoAntarorAl Ijaza Cafeteria, both near Jumeirah Beach Road, two beloved, neon-lit fast-food storefronts serving shawarma, porotta flatbreads rolled around kebabs and milky chai since the 1990s, before the homogenizing bulldozer of global food chains arrived. Try the hassan mathar (9 dirhams), a pocket sandwich with spit-roasted chicken, cheese, fries and hot sauce. A traditional lunch at the Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Centre for Cultural Understanding in Al Fahidi Historical Neighborhood. Al Qudra Cycle Track Watch the sun come up over the vast Al Marmoom Desert as you bike alongAl Qudra Cycle Track, a 30-minute drive or Uber ride east from the city center. Rent a bike atTrek Bicycle Store(166 dirhams for two hours) at the start of the dedicated cycling path, which hasloopssuitable for various levels of riders and groups, and is equipped with rest stops and water stations. The thrill of riding past undulating dunes, ghaf trees and date palms, glimpsing Arabian oryxes (native long-horned antelopes) and camels in the wild will make waking early worth it. Stop for rest roughly four miles in atAl Qudra Lakes, an oasis that attracts migratory birds including flocks of flamingos. Take in the sounds of families stretching out on picnic mats, peeling fruit with pocket knives and humming songs. Al Qudra Cycle Track Wipe off the dust and head west toMama’esh, a Palestinian restaurant in the Al Manara neighborhood that feels like a family’s living room, with walls covered in photographs, artifacts and mementos of daily life in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. There is a ticker announcing prayer times and a shelf crowded with herbs and recipe books. Mama’esh specializes in manakish, the traditional flatbread baked in stone ovens witholive oil sourced from Palestinian villagesand topped with za’atar, cheese or meat. Try the foul medammas (spiced fava beans), cheese manakish with hummus, and a stew of spiced eggplant, lentils and pomegranates. Brunch for two, around 100 dirhams. Hire a yacht, staffed with a crew, which costs surprisingly less of an arm and a leg than it sounds (450 dirhams an hourfor up to 10 adults and children withEverest Yacht Charter; minimum rental is two hours). You’ll leave behind the hustle of the city, drawn toward the lull of the sea as you taste the salt in the air and take in the skyline from a different perspective, cruising past the sail-shapedBurj Al Arabhotel; the palm-shaped, artificial islands ofPalm Jumeirah; and the Arabian archway of theAtlantis hotel. Bring along a portable speaker to play your own music, as well as your brunch leftovers and swimwear and a change of clothes so you can anchor  midsea and jump into the water.

36 Hours in Honolulu,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/28/travel/things-to-do-honolulu.html,"36 Hours ByMartha ChengNov. 28, 2024 By Martha ChengPhotographs by Michelle Mishina Kunz Martha Cheng has lived in Honolulu for nearly two decades. When people think of Hawaii, they tend to conjure Kauai’s jungles orMaui’s white sand beaches. But it’s Honolulu on the island of Oahu where most locals live and work, yielding a dynamic and complicated scene where Indigenous culture converges with Asian influences and midcentury Americana, and energetic food and arts scenes unfold against a backdrop of warm beaches and lush forest. Newreservationsystemsto hikeDiamond Head State Monumentand snorkelHanauma Bay Nature Preservehave helped lessen crowds and restore some of the flora and fauna, while new boutique hotels in Waikiki reclaim overlooked architectural gems. Advance planners should look for theHawaii Triennial(Feb. 15 to May 4), spread across landmark sites including the 135-year-oldBishop Museum, dedicated to Hawaiian culture, as well as Lē‘ahi, or Diamond Head, a volcanic tuff cone. A Diamond Head lookout Start your weekend by heading toward Diamond Head, the Oahu landmark that was formed by a volcanic eruption some 300,000 years ago and looms on the eastern edge of Waikiki. On the way, stop byFort Ruger Market. Previously a general store, serving the neighborhood since 1937, it now turns out Filipino and Hawaiian food classics. Pick up lechon (crispy-skinned roast pork, $19.95 a pound) and poke (seasoned raw cubed fish, $29.95 a pound), and bring your snacks to one of the lookouts on the crater’s southern flank. During the winter months, you might glimpse migrating humpback whales. Closer below you’ll see surfers catching their last waves of the day, and sometimes, during the Friday night sailing races, sailboats round the Diamond Head buoy as golden hour descends. A Diamond Head lookout Every Friday evening, theHonolulu Museum of Artkeeps its doors open until 9 p.m., and its courtyard cafe is a lovely spot to grab a glass of wine and listen to live music in between gallery hopping. New exhibitions includeKenyatta Kelechi’s collection(through Jan. 12), which depicts contemporary Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners through wet plate photography, a technique from the 19th century, and aretrospective of Satoru Abe(through July 20), arguably Hawaii’s most influential artist and still creating at age 98. His work spans seven decades across sculptures on themes of seeds, roots and trees to recent abstract multidirectional paintings (adults $25). An easy walk from the museum, but difficult to find,MW Restaurantis tucked into the second floor of a luxury car showroom. Out of sight of the Maseratis and Bentleys, MW’s dining room offers more subtle luxuries in the form of pork hash dumplings bathed in truffle-bacon broth ($18), Kona kampachi (amberjack) coated in dried mochi shavings and pan-fried until crisp ($48), and a recent special of a lobster lasagne ($65). Don’t skip dessert, in particular the shave ice ($16), a granita of seasonal and local fruit — which has recently included mango and persimmon — over panna cotta and coconut tapioca ($16). Regulars are known to pull up to the bar just for this upscale take on a local favorite. The orchid conservatory at Foster Botanical Garden. Wallflour Bake Shop Spread over two parking lots, theKaka‘ako farmers’ marketby Kewalo Basin Harbor, toward the western end of town, is big enough that you need a strategy. Start atWallflour Bake Shopbefore it sells out of its pastries. You might find a liliko‘i (passionfruit) sticky bun  ($6.50) or an Okinawan brown-sugar, twice-baked croissant stuffed with kinako (roasted soybean flour) paste ($6.50). Then beeline toMA‘O Organic FarmsandKahumana, two social enterprise farms supporting communities on the west side of Oahu, for local produce like tart-sweet apple bananas and longan. Marvel atSugah Papi’s Farms’ quick knife skills as you dig into a rainbow fruit bowl ($17) that might include dragonfruit, liliko‘i and starfruit. Wallflour Bake Shop Save room in your stomach and drive about 10 minutes west toEthel’s Grill, open since 1979, and a mainstay for its local Japanese and Okinawan classics. It’s a two-person operation run by the husband-and-wife team Robert and Minaka Urquidi, who took it over from Ms. Urquidi’s parents in recent years. They’ve kept most recipes largely the same, including hamburger steak topped with grated daikon and ponzu sauce ($14.95); goya champuru, an Okinawan stir fry of bittermelon and pork ($14.95); and taco rice ($16.95), a mashup born of Japanese and American military influences in Okinawa (parallels abound between Hawaii and Okinawa). During the pandemic, the tiny spot permanently transitioned to takeout only, so bring your haul to the next stop. Foster Botanical Garden Foster Botanical Garden($5 admission), an oasis wedged between the freeway and Chinatown, is home to an orchid conservatory and some of Oahu’s oldest trees, including a bodhi tree and endemic loulu palm. Watch out for falling cannonballs, the woody, heavy fruit of the cannonball tree. The grounds once belonged to Mary Mikahala Elizabeth Robinson Foster, known as the first Native Hawaiian Buddhist (the bodhi tree given to her is said to be a descendant of the one under which the Buddha attained enlightenment). She was one of only two people allowed to visit Queen Lili‘uokalani, Hawaii’s last monarch, in her imprisonment during the U.S. military-backed overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893. They shared a love of plants, so it’s fitting that theLili‘uokalani Botanical Gardenlies just across the freeway. Foster Botanical Garden Cindy’s Lei Shoppe As you leave the garden, admire the adjacentKuan Yin Temple, a Chinese Buddhist temple dedicated to the bodhisattva of compassion, and peer into the 1922 Shinto shrineIzumo Taishakyo Mission of Hawaii, across the street. Both are active places of worship, so approach with respect. From there, cross into Chinatown, which, perhaps more than any other Honolulu neighborhood, has faced cycles of prosperity and poverty. It is one of the largest intact historical districts, where newer boutiques and artists’ collectives coexist with longtime businesses. Buy a fragrant tuberose or white ginger flower lei (starting at about $15) atCindy’s Lei Shoppeand try on modern aloha shirts and dresses atRoberta Oaks’ store. PeruseNative Books at Arts & Letters Nu‘uanu, which carries an extensive selection of Hawaiian and Pacific Island books within an art gallery and community space. Cindy’s Lei Shoppe A hiking trail in the Tantalus area Ascend winding Tantalus Drive, through a canopy of trees dripping with vines, to reach theLiljestrand House, built by the architect Vladimir Ossipoff in 1952. Only accessible by advance reservation, guided tours ($50) lead you through one of his finest residential works, designed with California redwood, Yokohama sandstone from west Oahu and polished concrete for seamless transitions between indoors and outdoors. Or, if you prefer a full jungle immersion, the Tantalus region is a launching point for a network of hiking trails. Head toPu‘u ‘Ualaka‘a State Waysidefor panoramic views of the entire southern coastline, and for the beginning of the ‘Ualaka‘a Trail, a one-mile loop through banyans and pine trees. Beware, the path can get muddy and buggy after rains. A hiking trail in the Tantalus area Head toKaimana Beach, a small stretch near the base of Diamond Head. Don snorkel goggles and you may spot turtles and fish while dodging outrigger canoe paddlers returning to shore and swimmers making their laps to the windsock, the Dr. Seussian flag hanging on a pole about 800 feet from the beach. Enjoy the sunset on the sand or from the bar atHau Tree, the open-air restaurant atKaimana Beach Hotel, recently renovated for a boho beach vibe. The restaurant is named for the more than 100-year-old hau trees that provide the dining room’s canopy, and it’s said Robert Louis Stevenson penned poems under its branches. By the commercial fishing harbor,Nami Kazeopened a few years ago and has already become a local, multigenerational favorite. The chef and owner, Jason Peel, focuses on vegetable and seafood small plates. The entire first page of the menu is devoted to Hawaii’s produce, in the form of ‘ulu tots (fluffy, fried breadfruit bites) in barbecue sauce ($12) and corn beignets ($10) that are more like puffs of air dusted with Japanese curry powder. Slippery sensations abound in the raw tuna with natto (fermented soybeans) and okra ($24); if you prefer your seafood cooked, there’s pan-fried kampachi with ponzu butter ($34). (It’s also worth coming for brunch for creations like honey-walnut shrimp waffles.) The White Sands Hotel is featured in a self-guided Waikiki walking tour, created by the Surfjack Hotel and the nonprofit Docomomo. Holiday Surf Hotel, featured on the self-guided walking tour Many guides urge you to get out of touristy Waikiki, but it is full of gems, if you know where to look. Start with a Japanese breakfast at the traditionalYoshitsune, cloistered in thePark Shore Waikikihotel. The spread of broiled fish, pickles, housemade tofu and miso soup (from $35) will fuel your jaunt through Waikiki’s backstreets. Follow theself-guided tourby theSurfjack HotelandDocomomo, a nonprofit that preserves modern architecture and design. See the apartment building Waikiki Skyliner’s two patterns of breeze blocks, anchored by a black Puna lava rock wall; a three-story walk-up’s railing depicting breadfruit leaves and fruit; andWhite Sands Hotel, built around a courtyard pool and waterfall-fringed koi ponds. Holiday Surf Hotel, featured on the self-guided walking tour Island-Boy Explore the eclectic shops of Kaimuki, a neighborhood east of Waikiki. Seek outPitacus Chop Arton the second floor of a turquoise building, where the designer Lisa Weimken reworks vintage Japanese fabrics into one-of-a-kind dresses and unisex separates. Pop intoIsland-Boyshop where whimsy and minimalism share space on the shelves stocked with shaka-shaped bottle openers and Lindquist’s handmade leather bags. At the 70-year-oldCrack Seed Store, glass apothecary jars display a variety ofcrack seed(sour-salty-sweet preserved fruit snacks). For something more substantial, grab a slice of quiche or a sandwich atthe Local General Store, a bakery and butcher counter. Stick around long enough, and you can catchthe Curb, a cafe and wine bar, as it transitions from pouring coffee to natural wine at 2 p.m. Island-Boy An earlier version of this article misstated the end date of the 2025 Hawaii Triennial. It is May 4, not May 2.

"36 Hours in Tucson, Ariz.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/21/travel/things-to-do-tucson-arizona.html,"36 Hours ByAbbie KozolchykNov. 21, 2024 By Abbie KozolchykPhotographs by Nate Abbott Abbie Kozolchyk is a regular contributor to New York Times Travel who grew up in Tucson. No matter where else she’s lived — mostly Manhattan — she’s visited her home desert often. After triple-digit summer temperatures and 90-degree days that linger well into October, late fall restores an ultra-outdoorsy vibe to this mountain-ringed college town in the Sonoran Desert, an hour north of Mexico. A sure sign of the sweet season in Arizona’s second-largest city: thousands of cyclists flocking toEl Tour de Tucson(Nov. 23), one of the nation’s biggest road races and a Technicolor Lycra-clad reminder of the joys of exploring on two wheels when the weather turns reliably, ridiculously pleasant. Between your own adventures on the local trails, try a new spin on traditional Sonoran spirits, stargaze from a sky island, take in a juried exhibition of local artwork at theArizona Biennial(through Feb. 9)  and devour as many stuffed, steaming tortillas as possible. Get to know some of Tucson’s most fascinating creatures at theArizona-Sonora Desert Museum— more of a zoo than the name would suggest — about a 30-minute drive west of town (general admission, $29.95). From a series of winding pathways (most of the exhibits are outdoors and designed to blend into the surrounding wilderness), look out forjavelinas(picture shrunken wild boar impersonators), bighorn sheep, various wildcats and — yes, in the same area as the resident coyote — a roadrunner. Perhaps most surprising to visitors who’ve never contemplated desert waterways (Tucson has a few): the absurdly adorable otter and beaver. The museum’s mountain and valley views at golden hour also make the visit worthwhile. Gates Pass Gates Pass— a main artery to the Desert Museum — is a renowned sunset lookout. Locals debate the best spots to pull over along the twists and turns, but one pairing that works especially well for its diversity of landscapes and views is, first, the parking area for theDavid Yetman West Trailhead, then theGates Pass Overlook Trailhead. Wherever you stop, take the occasional break from the setting sun to turn and watch the mountains and valleys glow pink, orange and gold around you. Once the color fades, drive back to town flanked by an army of saguaros in dreamy silhouette. Gates Pass The Century Room at Hotel Congress While the drama has died down a bit atHotel Congresssince a 1934 fire led police to John Dillinger — the F.B.I.’s first public enemy No. 1 — the downtown institution remains one of Tucson’s liveliest scenes. Three stages host performers of all kinds, from metal to mariachi — and sometimes,Metalachi(many shows are free; tickets rarely exceed $35). A typical Friday-night lineup includes multiple performances between 6:30 and 11:30 p.m., so you can easily grab dinner before or after at the on-siteCup Café, where wine bottle chandeliers light up the cozy jumble of tables, banquettes and barstools. Start with the Barrio Heartbreaker: sliced baguette from the belovedBarrio Breadbakery with warm Brie, marmalade, roasted garlic and sliced apples, among other accompaniments ($19). The Century Room at Hotel Congress Sonora Moonshine Co. Hidden inside an old Veterans of Foreign Wars building, a quick walk from Hotel Congress, are two new sister bars: the street-levelSonora Moonshine Co. and — through a mural-covered roll-up door toward the back — the undergroundProhibición. The duo is the brainchild of Es Teran, who also ownsBorderlands Brewing Co., a craft beer brand known for cactus-infused I.P.A., horchata cream ale and other local brews. Now he hopes to expand Tucson’s appreciation of agave, a plant his family farms and distills in Mexico. Both bars stock various bacanoras — a Sonoran moonshine that went from prohibition in 1915 to denomination of origin in 2000 — and a library of other agave spirits. Try the Oaxacan Old Fashioned: mezcal añejo (aged at least a year) with mesquite-smoked mole and piloncillo, a raw cane sugar ($14, or $12 once the 10 p.m. happy hour starts). Sonora Moonshine Co. Most of the exhibits at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum are outdoors and designed to blend into the surrounding wilderness. Paco’s Mexican Food Steaming, stretchy flour tortillas — another Sonoran staple — are used to particularly decadent effect in Tucson’s beloved breakfast burritos. Conveniently, two favorite purveyors are a 30-second walk from each other on the east side of town:Paco’s Mexican FoodandAmelia’s Mexican Kitchen. Whether your travel party decides to divide and conquer or commit to one, know that the conjoined parking lots will be jammed on a Saturday morning, as will the line at Paco’s drive-through, where the most popular breakfast burritos with chorizo or bacon and cheese are $5.45. At Amelia’s, the best seller is the machaca (beef) burrito with eggs, pico de gallo, potatoes and cheese ($11.99), but vegans and vegetarians do well here, too, given the build-your-own menu. Paco’s Mexican Food Sabino Canyon Tucked into the Santa Catalina Mountains on Tucson’s northeast side,Sabino Canyondazzles even the annual-pass holders who hike or run here regularly (daily fee, $8 per car). Stop into thevisitors’ centerfor info on the short nature loops and half-day hikes, or if you find yourself so overcome by the saguaro-studded canyon walls and cottonwood-lined creek that you’re tempted to scrap the rest of today’s docket, consider a full-day hike, such as the aptly namedSeven Falls(about eight miles round-trip). The easiest way to explore the canyon, however, is to stick to the paved road — an approximately two-hour walk round-trip, or a60-minute narrated ride on an electric shuttlethat departs hourly from 9 a.m. ($15 for adults). Back near the visitors’ center, refresh with an iced latte fromOld Pueblo Coffee’stiny pink trailer. Sabino Canyon Eminently strollable, the downtown-adjacent Fourth Avenue is indie shop central.

36 Hours in Atlanta,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/14/travel/things-to-do-atlanta.html,"36 Hours ByRichard FaussetNov. 14, 2024 By Richard FaussetPhotographs by Ben Rollins Richard Fausset, a national correspondent for The New York Times, has lived in Atlanta for nearly two decades. IfSavannah,CharlestonorNew Orleansever boasts of exuding more Southern charm per square inch, Atlanta might well respond, “Bless their hearts.” The de facto capital of the American South moves with too much muscle and speed to be bothered by such quaint notions, secure in its position as a nexus of civil rights history, capitalist hustle, Black creativity, and (thanks to generous state tax credits) TV and film production. Beyond the traffic-choked highways, Atlanta’s older, more central neighborhoods actually offer abundant charm, thrumming with dining, nightlife and art. A key catalyst has been theAtlanta Beltline, the partly constructed 22-mile walking and biking path that has connected old parts of town in fresh ways, spurring revitalization and giving locals and visitors alike a place to enjoy the city outside their cars. Atlanta’s spiritual mission is spelled out in the civil rights landmarks along Auburn Avenue, the historic Black business corridor just east of downtown where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. grew up and later preached. Start at the old brick chapel ofEbenezer Baptist Church, which is overseen by the National Park Service (free admission). Find a seat in the pews, close your eyes and listen to recordings of King’s sermons from the 1960s that play on the sound system. Walk a minute east to see the crypts of King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, before continuing past an elegant stretch of Queen Anne-style houses, among them M.L.K.’s birth home (currently closed for renovation). End your walk with a fresh-fruit cup (from about $5) fromLottaFrutta, Auburn Avenue’s beloved pan-Latin frutería. Southern National The Atlanta Braves’2013 decision to leavethe struggling Summerhill neighborhood, just south of downtown, for a new stadium in the suburbs was met with lusty boos by city dwellers. Since then, however, all kinds of cool things have sprouted along Georgia Avenue, the neighborhood’s main street. Have a pilsner (about $6) and a chat atHalfway Crooks, a quirky and welcoming beer hall. Shop for wine and gifts, like a set of Willie Nelson-themed cocktail napkins ($54), atPress Shop. Nosh on jalapeño johnnycakes (part of a $12 bread plate) atSouthern National, an upscale import from Mobile, Ala. AtLittle Bear, an unpretentious but daring small-plates bistro, a sorbet of scuppernong, a beloved Southern grape variety, incorporates hints of coffee, corn and ají dulce, the habanero’s mellower cousin ($8). Southern National Atlanta’s famous hip-hop scene has long beentangled upin its strip club culture, but there are other, less prurient ways to feel the 808s rattle your teeth. On Edgewood Avenue,Harold’s Chicken & Ice Bar,a popular spot for gizzards and giblets, becomes a joyous, bumping dance club on weekend nights, attracting a crowd of 20- to 40-somethings. Usually at the controls on Fridays is Chris Marks, who spins records under the monikerCM the DJ. Atlanta hip-hop has evolved to contain multitudes — by turns socially conscious, psychedelic, ruminative, daring andjust plain weird. But Mr. Marks’s ecstatic sets (no cover) are built for dancing, and tend to feature an array of Southern drawls from Memphis to Texas tojust down the street. The High Museum of Art is displaying “Giants,” a selection of work from the collection of the musician couple Alicia Keys and Kasseem Dean, also known as Swizz Beats, through Jan. 19. Carroll Street Cafe TheCarroll Street Cafeis the social hub of Cabbagetown, an old millworkers’ neighborhood east of downtown crowded with small, brightly painted cottages, and home to artists, musicians and eccentric types. Find a table outside set along the impossibly narrow street, order a mimosa ($11) and absorb your neighbors’ chatter, which might touch on the glories of drop-D guitar tuning or job leads for gaffers (the local movie industry — call itY’allywoodat your peril — has a toehold here). Afterward, stroll north along Carroll Street, then turn right on what becomes Wylie Street, adorned with some of the city’s most striking public murals. A few blocks on, a left turn takes you through theKrog Street tunnel, where a riot of graffiti serves as a favored backdrop for rap videos and photo shoots. Carroll Street Cafe Eastside Trail The busiest stretch of the Beltline,the Eastside Trail, begins at the Krog tunnel and extends about two and a half miles north to the lovely green slopes ofPiedmont Park. The Beltline has been transformative for a city that for decades wasorganized around the car. And though its success has promptedserious concernsabout gentrification, it seems that Atlanta, finally, can see itself, particularly on weekends, when the path is crammed with flirting teenagers, exercise freaks, extrovert roller skaters, buskers and cool kids rocking complicated sneakers from the future. ExplorePonce City Market, a mall and food court set in a reconditioned former Sears distribution center. Refresh atPub on Ponce, which is set in a Kroger supermarket and serves beer and wine through a window onto a patio that can feel like the city’s front porch. Eastside Trail High Museum of Art TheHigh Museum of Art’s folk art collection is among the South’s best, featuring works fromHoward Finster, the Georgia preacher whose idiosyncratic, funny and dreamlike work has beenchampionedby the Athens, Ga., rock band R.E.M., among others. In the last few years, the High has taken special care to feature Black art, reinforcing Atlanta’s reputation as a center of Black expression and ideas. Current shows includea photo exhibitionfrom Tyler Mitchell, the first Black artist to shoot the cover of Vogue (through Dec. 1); “Giants,” a selection of work from the collection of the musician couple Alicia Keys and Kasseem Dean, also known as Swizz Beats (through Jan. 19); andhighlightsfrom the museum’s growing collection of spectacular African American quilts (through Jan. 5). High Museum of Art Camila Cabello’s 2017 pop hit “Havana” famously rhymed the Cuban capital with the low-key neighborhood of East Atlanta (ooh na na) as it described a geographically knotty 21st-century romance. But a night out in East Atlanta Village, a scruffy cluster of bars, restaurants and shops, will have you falling in love with all kinds of cultures in the same place. Seek out São Paulo-style pizza, with its surprising toppings like Brie and pepper jam ($22) atBrasiliana. Order Jack Daniel’s shots ($8) for new tattooed friends in old Motörhead T-shirts atFlatiron Bar. At the farm-to-table standoutBanshee, a plate of late-summer malfatti dumplings ($30) recently on offer featured squash, sun-dried tomatoes, capers and smokyBenton’s bacon. Banshee morphs into a dance club (free admission) at around 11 p.m. Piedmont Park, a popular destination on the Eastside Trail. Grant Park Farmers Market The Grant Park Farmers Markettakes place every Sunday in the historic neighborhood of the same name. The best treats — fresh peaches and tomatoes — are to be found in the summertime, but there are reasons to visit all year long. Pick up a jar of duck liver pâté with black-cherry aspic ($12) fromthe Spotted Trotter, a local butcher, and a baguette fromTGM Bread($3) for an easy picnic. And be sure to tolerate the long lines atthe Little Tart, the local bakery chain founded by Sarah O’Brien, Atlanta’s perfectionist virtuoso of viennoiserie. Gobble her Parisian-level butter croissant ($4.50) right there; take home a box of veganblueberry-lemon cornmeal cookies($2.65 each) for your friends. Grant Park Farmers Market Fuqua Orchid Center at the Atlanta Botanical Garden In much of the rural South, the family garden plot never went out of style, and the garden club remains a backbone of small-town civic life. TheAtlanta Botanical Garden(adult tickets, $29.95) implicitly honors such traditions, and takes them to new heights across 30 walkable acres that include the delicate beauties of theFuqua Orchid Center, in two dedicated display houses. Exquisite, botanically inspiredglass sculptures by the artist Dale Chihulyare on permanent display, and the garden often hosts other temporary sculpture exhibits. Note there are no bad-weather refunds. But ducking into a room full of orchids to escape a Georgia thunderstorm might make for the perfect sensuous coda to your trip. Fuqua Orchid Center at the Atlanta Botanical Garden An earlier version of this article misstated an offering by the Darwin Hotel. It does not offer free parking. An earlier version of this article misspelled the better-known name of Kasseem Dean, the music producer and art collector. It is Swizz Beatz, not Swizz Beats.

It’s Not Too Late to Rein In Holiday Spending,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/your-money/holiday-spending-limits.html,"Advertisement Supported by your money adviser Research suggests that you’ll spend less than you otherwise would by setting a strict budget — even if you go over the budget. ByAnn Carrns Black Friday and Cyber Monday have come and gone. So you may think that setting limits on holiday spending is a lost cause, right? Not so, said Jamie L. Clark, a certified financial planner in Seattle. The December holidays are still weeks away. “It’s never too late to make a plan.” Chuck Howard, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, said research suggests you’ll spend less by setting a holiday budget that’s “optimistically low.” That’s because even when compliance with budgets is weak, setting stricter, even somewhat unrealistic budgets tends to lead to lower spending, according to a study he helped write on the influence of budgeting on personal spending. Dr. Howard cited this example. Say you usually spend $500 a month dining out. You may think a realistic budget is $400 a month. But if you really want to cut back, you should set a budget of, say, $250. That way, if you spend $350, you’ve still spent much less than you used to. A tight holiday-spending limit serves as a reference point, he said, and even if you surpass it, you’ll probably spend less than if you had set a higher limit or hadn’t set a budget in the first place.

‘Junk Fees’ or ‘Unbundling’? Airlines and Senators Battle Over Added Costs.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/travel/airline-fees-senate.html,"Advertisement Supported by At a congressional hearing on Wednesday, senators framed the tacked-on fees for passenger seats or bags as akin to extortion. Airline executives pushed back, saying they gave customers options. ByAmelia Nierenberg Is paying to check a bag on a flight a choice, or tantamount to extortion? A group of senators and executives from five of America’s major airlinessparred overthat question on Wednesday at a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, whichissued a reportlast month arguing that airline fees, for services like checking bags and choosing seats, had raised costs for passengers and left them without recourse. “Passengers now are forced to pay extra for almost everything,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and head of the subcommittee. He said customers felt like “piggy banks to be shaken down by these skyrocketing fees — that seem to have no connection to any costs that the airlines incur.” The bipartisan group of senators was trying to crack down on the charges, which lawmakers call junk fees and airlines often frame as “unbundling.” Under the Biden administration, the Department of Transportation has worked totargetthem. Last year,baggage fees alonetotaled $7 billion across 14 carriers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The airline executives argued that the fees give consumers choices by letting them pay only for the things they want. “Our customers who prioritize affordability have the option to choose a lower-fare product — and in doing so, opt out of paying for additional services they do not need nor want,” said Andrew Nocella, the chief commercial officer of United Airlines, adding, “In our view, a one-size-fits-all travel model would deny lower-cost options to our customers.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

What if Charity Shouldn’t Be Optimized?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/business/charity-holiday-giving-optimized.html,"The recent trend in philanthropy has been to look for the most bang for your buck. Maybe you don’t have to. Credit...Photo illustration by Jack Smyth Supported by ByEmma Goldberg Equipped with tools to measure our calories, steps, working hours, wasted hours, water intake and sleep cycles, we have now been exhorted to measure our charitable impact, too.Books,podcasts,TikToksanddigital guidesimplore us to donate our money cautiously, rationally, to the charities that promise to make a dollar go the furthest it can. Holiday season giving can start to feel a little like sports betting: It doesn’t matter if you’re loyal to a scrappy local team — the data can tell you exactly where your money should go. This is not how I thought about charity when I was growing up. I remember my childhood neighbor declaring that when he rode the subway he sometimes found himself spending more than he would on a cab, because he did not believe in toughening his heart toward people asking for change. This seemed like an approach that made up for impracticality with grace: When someone in front of you says they need help, do not look away. What is the right way to give away money, anyway? The debate has been fomented partly by a group of billionaires — most prominently the Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife, Cari Tuna — whose approach to charity argues, essentially, that you do not get to feel good for having done anything at all. People should give wherever their money is most needed and most likely to yield the biggest effects. Mr. Moskowitz and Ms. Tuna are among the Silicon Valley billionaires who have embraced the philosophical movement known as effective altruism, a worldview that focuses on optimizing good. Elon Musk, a founder of Tesla and SpaceX,said effective altruist thinkingclosely aligned with his views. The co-founder of Skype,Jaan Tallinn, also supported the movement, and former board members of OpenAI had ties to it as well. For billionaires who made their money by crunching numbers, effective altruism extends that into the way they give away their money, too. It is a data-loving engineer’s mode of do-gooding, for the first generation of ultra wealth created by engineers It’s an approach that can give people moral permission to keep amassing more wealth — as long as they give some of it away. E.A. fits comfortably into an era of widening inequality, as the fortunes of the world’s richest have grown, and so has their ability to shape ideas for the rest of us. E.A. applied the sheen of good will (altruism) to a brand of thinking (optimization) that had already taken over the way weeatandexercise, work and live. And just as health optimization began as a tech-world obsession that trickled down to the rest of us, something similar has happened in recent years with the ethos of effective altruism and Americans’ sensibility around charitable giving. Hello! I'm wondering: How do you decide where to donate money? Did reading this article give you any new ideas to consider? @Emma Goldberg, yes! This article gave us much to think about. In my family, we are not wealthy but comfortable, and our own lives have benefited greatly from many nonprofit organizations - especially those with missions relating to religion, arts, and education. So it's easy and natural for us to support those organizations. We don't need to see a rating, because we've seen the results of their work with our own eyes. Perhaps there are many who either don't attend anything run by a non-profit, or don't realize they do, so they think giving is only about stereotypical poor people in a faraway place. I like that you offer options for a more balanced approach. I live around the poverty level so have little money to give to charity. I am very thoughtful of how I spend the money I do have. I do not want to add harm to the world by the way I spend money thereby necessitating charity. I try to ""first do no harm.""As examples:I have a small IRA. I choose the funds and companies that are not polluting industries or harm animals, the ones that pay living wages. I check As We Sow for suggestions of ethical investing.I buy and eat food that has been grown organically, and regenerative when I can find it. I only eat pasture raised meat and eggs because I don't want the animals to suffer. I feel I'd be ingesting that suffering if I were to eat them. I buy fair trade chocolate and tea.I recently purchased a sofa and took my time buying it. I purchased one that had been made in North Carolina by workers paid living wages. It also didn't out-gas harmful chemicals and was made with Forest Stewardship Council certified wood.I recently replaced my really old car with a EV. I love it because it is so quiet and does not contribute to the smog of my city.I wear clothes as long as they are presentable, then wear them in my yard planting native flowers for the pollinators and birds. Then I turn them into rags to clean the house.Can I do better? Yes. But striving to live causing as little harm as possible gives me great joy and satisfaction. Even if I can't cut a big check to the local humane society or women's shelter each Christmas. @Emma Goldberg thank you for this article. I give to a range of organizations, some that have changed the arc of my life and my family’s, some that envision a world that is livable for everyone, and some that add cultural value that makes the livable life worth living. I feel fortunate to be able to give across this spectrum, and would never shame anyone for giving in a modest or values driven way, unlike the implicit criticism that EA adherents level at the rest of us. @Emma Goldberg Opening with a caveat - I'm a nonprofit fundraiser at a relatively large organization. But I prefer to donate to small, community-based nonprofits, parks/botanic gardens, and museums primarily because I know from experience that these organizations often have the hardest time quantifying their impact. Solid data practices require resources that are out of reach or impractical for many of these organizations. My choices as a donor, nonprofit decision-maker, and fundraiser are informed by another philanthropic school of thought: community-centric fundraising, which is also an equity-based framework. The difference is that it denounces more data-centric modes of giving as inherently harmful to scrappy but impactful community-based organizations, particularly those run by, and for, members of historically marginalized communities. It also embraces time/volunteerism, connections within the community, and resource-sharing among nonprofits and other local organizations as ways to give and make a difference. It's interesting that two opposite movements are both based on genuine concern for social justice. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

How to Avoid Pickpockets and Street Scams,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/travel/how-to-avoid-pickpockets-and-street-scams.html,"Advertisement Travel 101 Staying aware, keeping your valuables close and employing “layers of security” are among the ways to improve your street savvy. ByElaine Glusac Elaine Glusac is theFrugal Travelercolumnist, focusing on budget-friendly tips and journeys. Street theft isn’t petty to a victim. Having your pocket picked or bags stolen can ruin your trip and your finances. The best ways to avoid street crime is to maintain awareness, travel asset-light and understand where it tends to happen (be sure to read the destination’sState Departmentprofile). The problem with cash is that if it’s stolen, you can’t get it back. If a credit card is stolen, holders can cancel it, which protects them from unauthorized activity. Still, there are many situations in which you may need cash, such as for tips (and some destinations, such as Morocco, still rely mainly on cash). When you go out, carry only the amount that you’ll need that day and leave the rest in your accommodations, or rely on A.T.M.s (though be mindful ofA.T.M. service charges). Depending on where she’s traveling, Sally French, a travel expert with the online financial siteNerdwallet, usually carries no more than $200 in cash. “It tends to cover a couple of meals and a taxi ride in emergencies,” Ms. French said. When paying with cards that have a microchip, use the tap feature rather than swiping, if you can. Card readers are vulnerable toskimming, a scam in which your card’s financial details can be read and stolen by a payment system that has been tampered with.

How Australia Will (or Won’t) Keep Children Off Social Media,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/australia/australia-social-media-ban.html,"Advertisement Supported by Critics say big questions remain not only about how the new law will be enforced, but also about whether the ban will really protect young people. ByYan Zhuang Australia has passed a law to prevent children under 16 from creating accounts on social media platforms. The bill, which the government calls a “world leading” move to protect young people online, was approved in the Senate on Thursday with support from both of the country’s major parties. The lower house of Parliament had passed it earlier in the week. “This is about protecting young people — not punishing or isolating them,” said Michelle Rowland, Australia’s communications minister. She cited exposure to content about drug abuse, eating disorders and violence as some of the harms children can encounter online. The legislation hasbroad supportamong Australians, and some parental groups have been vocal advocates. But it has faced backlash from an unlikely alliance of tech giants, human rights groups and social media experts. Critics say there are major unanswered questions about how the law will be enforced, how users’ privacy will be protected and, fundamentally, whether the ban will actually protect children. The law requires social media platforms to take “reasonable steps” to verify the age of users and prohibit those under 16 from opening accounts. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Free from Elon Musk, and his tedious quest to turn X into a right-wing echo chamber where he and his friends are the permanent, inescapable main characters. Free from Threads and its suffocating algorithm, which suppresses news and real-time discussions in favor of bland engagement bait. Free from my own bad habit, honed through years of obsessive Twitter use, of packaging my thoughts for consumption by an audience of opinionated strangers.

How to Add Extra Security Layers to Your Phone or Tablet,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/technology/personaltech/security-iphone-android.html,"Advertisement Supported by Tech Tip New features in Apple’s iOS 18 and Google’s Android 15 can lock up apps with sensitive information and even hide them from view. ByJ. D. Biersdorfer J. D. Biersdorfer is the Tech Tip columnist for The Times. Losing a smartphone or tablet stuffed with your life’s details can be a nightmare, but your privacy may also be at risk in less obvious situations — like if you leave your unlocked phone unattended or if the children know your tablet’s passcode. While apps for financial or medical matters typically require their own passwords (andApple’s PhotosandGoogle Photoscan hide specific pictures), the latest versions of iOS and Android offer new tools for further shielding sensitive content on your device. Here’s a quick overview. Apple’siOS 18, released in September,now includesthe ability to lock apps that don’t already require apasscode,Face IDorTouch IDto open them. Applenotesthat look-alike siblings and children could bypass Face ID, so use a secret passcode if that’s a concern. To lock an app, find it on theiPhone’soriPad’shome screen (or in theApp Library) and press your finger on its icon. In the pop-up menu, select “Require Face ID” or the security method you normally use. Tap “Require Face ID” again when prompted. To open that app going forward, you’ll need to unlock it. To remove the lock from an app, press down on its icon and select “Don’t Require Face ID” from the menu. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

How Tech Created a ‘Recipe for Loneliness’,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/technology/personaltech/technology-loneliness.html,"Tech Fix Technology and loneliness are interlinked, researchers have found, stoked by the ways we interact with social media, text messaging and binge-watching. Credit...Derek Abella Supported by ByBrian X. Chen Brian X. Chen is the author of Tech Fix, a column about the social implications of the tech we use. Over the summer, Laura Marciano, a researcher at Harvard,interviewed 500 teenagersfor a continuing study investigating the link between technology and loneliness. The results were striking. For several weeks, the teenagers, who were recruited with the help of Instagram influencers, answered a questionnaire three times a day about their social interactions. Each time, more than 50 percent said they had not spoken to anyone in the last hour, either in person or online. To put it another way, even though the teenagers were on break from school and spending plenty of time on social media apps, most of them were not socializing at all. Americans now spend more time alone, have fewer close friendships and feel more socially detached from their communities than they did 20 years ago. One in two adults reports experiencing loneliness, the physiological distress that people endure from social isolation. The nation’s surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy,declared loneliness an epidemiclate last year. Ever since, scholars and psychologists have accelerated research into whether technology is contributing. The rise of smartphones and social networking apps has forever changed social norms around how we communicate. More personable interactions like phone calls have been superseded by text messages. When people broadcast their lives on TikTok and Instagram, they may not be representing themselves in a genuine way. “It’s hard to know who’s being real online, and it’s hard for people to be themselves online, and that is a recipe for loneliness,” Dr. Murthy said in an interview. He concluded that loneliness had become an epidemic after reviewing scientific studies and speaking with college students last year, he said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

How to Use Images From Your Phone to Search the Web,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/technology/personaltech/phone-web-search-images.html,"ArtificialIntelligence Advertisement Supported by Tech Tip If you’re not sure how to describe what you want with keywords, use your camera or photo library to get those search results. ByJ. D. Biersdorfer J. D. Biersdorfer writes the Tech Tip column, a weekly literary quiz and the occasional book review for The Times. A picture is worth a thousand words, but you don’t need to type any of them to search the internet these days.Boosted by artificial intelligence, software on your phone can automatically analyze objects live in your camera view or in a photo (or video) to immediately round up a list of search results. And you don’t even need the latest phone model or third-party apps; current tools for Android and iOS can do the job with a screen tap or swipe. Here’s how. Google’sCircle to Searchfeature,released early this yearfor Android devices, makes firing off a query as easy as dragging your finger around a specific object on the screen — all without switching apps. The feature is available ondozens of Android phones, including manySamsung Galaxydevices. (Galaxy users also have Samsung’sBixby Visiontool for visual search.) To use Circle to Search,make sure it is enabled. OnAndroid 15, open the Settings, choose Display & Touch and select Navigation Mode to see the Circle to Search controls. (Steps vary based on the hardware and software involved, but the Settings search box can help you find Circle to Search if you have it.) Now, when you see something that you want to investigate further, summon Circle to Search by pressing the circular home button at the bottom of the screen (for 3-Button navigation) or by pressing the navigation handle (the horizontal line at the bottom of the screen) for Gesture navigation. When Circle to Search is activated, the screen dims slightly and a menu of search tools appears. Drag your finger around the onscreen item that interests you, and Google Search results will appear below the image. You can add keywords to narrow the search, andA.I. overviewsmay be included.

A Hanukkah-Ready Recipe That Does Everything Right,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/dining/hanukkah-recipe.html,"HolidayRecipes Advertisement Supported by Inspired by a Ukrainian cafe and a mother-in-law’s classic, this take on kasha varnishkes is rich with caramelized onions. ByJoan Nathan When my daughter Daniela returned from a work trip to Eastern Europe last summer, she raved about the kasha varnishkes at Kafe Jerusalem, a tiny Ashkenazic Jewish restaurant in Lviv, Ukraine. According to her, it was even better than mine. I pride myself on my recipe, having learned it from my mother-in-law Paula, a kasha varnishkes maven who grew up not far from Lviv, so I found this news perturbing, to say the least. Paula’s version was a simple yet ethereal mixture of caramelized onions; kasha, the hulled groats of buckwheat berries; and varnishkes, one of several Yiddish words for noodles. But often, the dish is bland, lacking in onions with buckwheat that’s too finely ground. Curious to know what made Kafe Jerusalem’s kasha varnishkes so special, I contacted Marianna Dushar, a food anthropologist in Lviv who focuses on the food of Galicia, which covers parts of western Ukraine and southern Poland. “First and foremost, it’s all about the kasha,” Ms. Dushar wrote in an email, translating for the restaurant’s chef-owner, Lola Landa. Around 1880, long before my in-laws came to the United States in 1950, a large wave of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe brought kasha varnishkes to the Lower East Side. Mostbought their stone-ground buckwheat fromWolff’s, long the go-to for the grain. Since the 1930s, Birkett Mills has milled Wolff’s buckwheat in its an 18th-century grist mill in Penn Yan, N.Y.,where it thrived in the region’s Eastern Europe-like climate. (Today, the company still sells its buckwheat widely, but because the gluten-free, protein-rich, climate-resilient grain has become increasingly popular, there are many brands, including a number of smaller producers, putting their versions on the shelves.)

ByMelissa Clark As a festive main dish, chicken thighs may sound like a stretch. As opposed to, say, a glistening, bronze-skinnedwhole roasted bird, a panful of thighs can feel a little basic — not so much “Happy holidays!” as “Welp, it’s Tuesday.” Leave it to Carolina Gelen to flip the script. With a sweet and sour pan sauce made from orange juice, cranberries and a cinnamon stick, her ruby-huedcranberry-orange chickenwould be reason enough to have people over. The best part is, as festive as the dish is, it’s also easy. It’s the kind of thing to simmer up when you’re “just” having a few friends over after work but still plan to break out the bubbly or, as Carolina sagely suggests, a bottle of crisp white wine.

Is Protein Powder a Scam?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/well/eat/protein-powder-scams.html,"Advertisement Supported by Scam or Not Most people don’t need to consume this supplement, experts say, but it can be useful in certain situations. ByAlice Callahan On TikTok, influencers tout protein powder as key tobuilding muscleandnourishing their bodies— all in a quick, convenient scoop added to coffee or a smoothie. There’s no question that protein is essential for making muscles, strengthening bones and maintaining your immune system, digestion and hormone levels. But most protein powders are considered dietary supplements, which raises the question: Do you really need a supplement to get enough protein? And if you do, what kind is best? We asked experts for advice. The “vast majority” of people in the United States already get enough protein from the foods they eat and don’t need to take it in supplement form, said Colleen Tewksbury, an assistant professor of nutrition science at the University of Pennsylvania. Federal guidelines recommend that adults 19 and older consume 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. That comes out to 54 grams for a 150-pound adult, or 72 grams for a person weighing 200 pounds. Research suggests, however, thatolder adultsmay benefit from adding about 50 percent more protein, and those who arepregnant,breastfeedingor doregular strength or endurance trainingmay want to double the recommended amount or more. Whole foods — like chicken, fish, lean meats, yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, nuts, beans and lentils — are the best sources of protein, experts said. They offer a variety of other valuable nutrients, like vitamins, minerals, fiber, healthy fats and plant-based compounds, said Wayne Campbell, a professor of nutrition science at Purdue University.

It’s Time for Nutella Tres Leches Cake,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/dining/rick-martinez-nutella-tres-leches-cake.html,"Advertisement Newsletter Though, to be fair, it’s hard to imagine a time when Rick Martínez’s chocolaty take on the classic dessert wouldn’t be welcome. ByMia Leimkuhler Nutella tres leches cake! Sorry, I’ll calm down. I just really love tres leches cake — it’s cold and creamy, light yet dense, sweet but not one-note. As a kid, my favorite part of the birthday cake-ice cream combo was when the ice cream melted into the cake, forming an almost puddinglike creation that had to be scooped off the paper Lisa Frank plate with a spoon. Très tres leches. So I am, of course, very thrilled for this new Nutella tres leches cake from Rick Martínez, which replaces the condensed milk with chocolate hazelnut spread, and whisks a combination of that and whole milk into the evaporated milk and heavy cream. To underline the cake’s chocolatyness (technical term), Rick blooms cocoa powder in hot coffee for the cake batter and adds Nutella to the whipped topping. Serve your tres leches after a dinner of Rick’schicken enchiladasorpavo al pastorfor a perfect meal.

With that out of the way, let’s move backward to dinner. December, to me, is lasagna month. It feeds a crowd; there’sa version for every tasteand dietary preference; and, decorated with a couple of basil leaves, it looks so festive with its red and green. A cold winter Sunday is a great excuse to stay in, play some Vince Guaraldi and make Samin Nosrat’sbig lasagna, a dish that is grand in every sense of the word. Any weekend is great for roasting a chicken. Sohla El-Waylly’s dry-brined,spatchcocked roast chickenis excellent. Not only does it cook in much less time than a whole bird, but cutting out the backbone with my trustykitchen shearsmakes me feel like some sort of butchering wizard. Serve Sohla’s chicken with Gregory Gourdet’s beautifulcarrot salad with oranges and cashewsor, if you want something a bit crisper but still citrusy, this simpleendive and arugula saladfrom David Tanis. French toast is also an excellent winter-weekend treat — so much so that I make a point to regularly swing by the Vietnamese bakery near me to see if it has any marked-down, stale coconut bread I can use. That’ll get me part of the way to thisipo pain perdu, a coconut-bread French toast from Heimata Hall, adapted by Ligaya Mishan. Their recipe includes instructions for making your own ipo — a Tahitian bread made with grated coconut and coconut milk — and I will certainly try that. But I’ll also try it with my discounted bread, giving it that extra coconut goodness with a dunk in coconut milk and a sprinkle of coconut sugar.

Rick Steves Refuses to Get Cynical About the World,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/magazine/rick-steves-interview.html,"The Interview The Interview Credit...Devin Oktar Yalkin for The New York Times Supported by ByLulu Garcia-Navarro In 1994, just after I graduated from college, I put on a backpack and set off to see the world. I climbed the Andes in Ecuador, taught English in Cambodia and spent months visiting monasteries in Tibet. It was the most transformative period of my life. It also feels like a period from another era, and not just because of the amount of time that has passed. Now when it’s time to get away, I choose a destination that doesn’t ask too much of me and to which I don’t give much back. Instead of traveling to discover, I travel to retreat. Rick Steves also experienced transformational travel when he was in his 20s, but he never retreated from it, and he has been helping people to get the most out of their trips ever since. The prolific guidebook writer and beloved PBS personality (in a 2019profileof Steves in this magazine, my colleague Sam Anderson lovingly called him “one of the legendary PBS superdorks”) sincerely believes that travel can make the world a better place, and make us better people. He’s 69 now, but his upcoming book, “On the Hippie Trail” — a collection of journal entries that he resurfaced while stuck at home during the pandemic — chronicles a journey he took from Istanbul to Kathmandu in 1978. It’s an inspiring read, full of the joy of adventure and discovery, and talking with him about it, and about his life and cancer diagnosis, helped me figure out what I had been missing in my own more recent travels and outlook. I was reading your book, which is the diaries of a trip that you took in 1978 when you were 23 on what was called “the hippie trail.” When you reread those, what did they evoke in you, with the hindsight of age now?First of all, what kind of 23-year-old would write a 60,000-word journal while on a hippie bus going from Istanbul to Kathmandu? I was not a travel writer. I was a piano teacher. I was writing that for me, and when I read it, it was really insightful, if I might sound immodest. One thing I love as a writer is, you can’t go back to the United States and write it up. You’ve got to write it up right there, in the humid, buggy reality with all the cacophony of culture all around you. That’s where you take your notes and it’s most vivid. And I was doing that on that hippie trail, sitting there, watching the needle bend as it went into my travel partner’s arm at the border so he could get his shot because he didn’t have it on his yellow International Certificate of Vaccination. That’s a vivid moment, to think that you’re stopped on the border between Iran and Afghanistan and glad you don’t have the needle going intoyourarm. Reading this book really brought me back. When I was 23, I went on my own version of the hippie trail. I went to different countries — I went to Asia — but the thing that changed the course of my life happened there. I was in Vietnam, and it was the 20th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, and I was not interested in journalism in any way, shape or form, and I happened to be at this bar called Apocalypse Now.Wow.

Are Childhood Vaccines ‘Overloading’ the Immune System? No.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/health/childhood-vaccines-immunity.html,"Advertisement Supported by Vaccines today are more efficient and contain far fewer stimulants to the immune system than some used decades ago. ByApoorva Mandavilli It’s an idea as popular as it is incorrect: American babies now receive too many vaccines, which overwhelm their immune systems and lead to conditions like autism. This theory has been repeated so often that it has permeated the mainstream, echoed by President-elect Donald J. Trump and his pick to be the nation’s top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “When you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is, like, 38 different vaccines and it looks like it’s been for a horse, not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Kennedy on a call in July. “And then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically — I’ve seen it too many times.” On Sunday, Mr. Trump returned to the theme, saying Mr. Kennedy would investigate whether childhood vaccines caused autism, even though dozens of rigorous studies have already explored and dismissed that theory. “I think somebody has to find out,” Mr. Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” But the idea that today’s vaccines are overtaxing children’s immune systems is fundamentally flawed, experts said. Vaccines today are cleaner and more efficient, and they contain far fewer stimulants to the immune system — by orders of magnitude — than they did decades ago. What’s more, the immune reactions produced by vaccines are “minuscule” compared with those that children experience on a daily basis, said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatrician at Stanford University who advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccines.

This Chef’s Stunning Christmas Spread Is Unexpectedly Effortless,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/dining/how-to-cook-christmas-dinner.html,"HolidayRecipes Anchored by juicy braised duck and finished with an unforgettable family-size crème brûlée, this menu from Clare de Boer will have everyone talking. The chef Clare de Boer sets up her holiday feast as a buffet.Credit...Kate Sears for The New York Times. Supported by ByClare de Boer A feast is only a feast if both effort and bounty are shared. Unfortunately, a communal approach can be at odds with those of us trying to achieve the still-life-grade spreads ofChristmaslore. You may look at the photos printed with this article and scoff: “There’s no way that table was laid in real life.” And you’d be right. There wasn’t a child hanging off my leg or a hovering helper tasting the kale as I pulled it out of the pot. Real life is messy, andChristmas morningis chaos. But with the right preparation and forethought, you can walk into the stocking opening with coffee and two assurances: (1) that 90 percent of the meal is already aced and (2) that you have the right tricks to move swarming nibblers away from your kitchen island when it’s time to pull it all together. Over the past five years, since having the torch of hostingChristmaspassed to me, I’ve learned to share the right work, so that family and guests get involved and everyone’s dinner becomes more satisfying. In the days leading up to Christmas — perhaps during a lull on the 23rd, while the chaos is contained — I get my crew to do basic jobs. We pull out theBananagrams, and I place bowls of garlic, herbs and chestnuts on the table to peel, pick and score. It’s actually useful, especially if there’s someone auditioning for a permanent place in the family: They’ll pick every thyme leaf off every branch. Practiced cooks (and my brother) wouldn’t bother! This year, I’llbraise duck legswith ginger, anise and orange until they barely hold their shape. In the quiet, I’ll be able to hear the duck spit when its fat is rendered and its skin begins to brown — my cue to pay attention. Ahoneyed salad dressingwill take leaf dips, tastes and tweaks until I’m certain it’ll charm chicory-phobes. I’ll bakea family-size custardthat’ll become crème brûlée tomorrow — it’s just cream, sugar, vanilla and eggs cooked to a wobble — but I don’t want anyone around to give second opinions as I perform my dish-shimmying checks to catch it when it’s just set. If your Christmas Eve is already called for, find some time to be at one with the more detailed cooking before the house fills. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

How to Turn Up the Heat on Your Mulled Cocktails,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/dining/drinks/mulled-cocktails.html,"Advertisement Supported by A mulled white wine made with coriander, fennel and elderflower liqueur, a punchy nonalcoholic mulled cider, and mulled beer fortified with Cognac will make the season bright. ByRebekah Peppler Cold weather makes a near universal case for hot drinks. Add in a festive season and mulled wine quickly enters the chat. The heady, warming drink dates to Roman antiquity and remains a seasonal staple. In markets across Europe, steaming mugs have various monikers — “vin chaud” in France, “glogg” in Sweden, “glühwein” in Austria and Germany — frequently made by heating together red wine, a sweetener such as sugar or honey, and spices. Some are fortified with boozier spirits, others dotted with plump dried fruits and nuts, and often the fragrant result smells better than it tastes. To avoid a potpourri-adjacent drink, reconsider what it means to mull in the first place. To resort briefly to a timeworn wedding toast opener: Webster’s New World College Dictionary defines the word “mull” as a transitive verb, meaning “to heat, sweeten and flavor with spices (wine, cider, ale, etc.).” While classic mulling spices — cinnamon sticks, cloves, ginger, allspice, star anise — tend toward the baking set, the act of mulling refers less to a static mix of spices and more to the technique. But a shift toward less-obvious choices opens up a modern world of mulling: Earthy, tart and often relegated to savory applications, whole coriander seeds impart a citrusy, floral flavor and fragrance. A smattering of black peppercorns infuse them with darker fruit notes as well as heat. Bay leaves add an herbal, aromatic flavor. Diaspora Co., a spice company, uses fennel seeds in its chai masala, which lend a warm sweetness. “It’s a nontraditional addition,” said Sana Javeri Kadri, Diaspora’s founder and chief executive, “but we found that when you have that anise-y sweetness you actually end up needing less sugar.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The Under-the-Radar Filipino Island That Evokes 1970s Bali,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/t-magazine/siargao-filipino-island-that-evokes-1970s-bali.html,"Advertisement Newsletter A guide to Siargao, a surf spot turned luxury escape, with insider tips on where to find powdery beaches and coconut slushies.

Have a question? You can always reach us attmagazine@nytimes.com. Spend a few days in Siargao, the fig-shaped Filipino island in the country’s southeast, and locals will tell you, with a mix of anxiety and excitement, that the coconut tree-covered enclave is what Bali was in the 1970s. Or they might say, as the documentarian and trans-rights activist Queenmelo Esguerra told me last month, that laid-back hotels and cafes that’ve opened this decade (likeSiago), “feel inspired by Tulum, no?” What the island, one of more than 7,000 that comprise the Philippines, shares with these busier destinations is a bohemian history, warm hospitality, beautiful jungle and ocean surroundings and an under-the-radar sense of cool that, as some locals rightfully worry, will quickly diminish if the construction seemingly happening everywhere isn’t carefully managed. Two years ago, the main airport began a major expansion — and now there are more than two dozen short flights each week to Siargao from two of the country’s major cities, Manila and Cebu; in recent years, United and Philippine Airlines started direct routes to Manila from New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Some residents fear that cruise ship docks aren’t far-off on the horizon. For now, though, this 169-square-mile landmass still feels very remote. Regular visitors, like the mononymous Singaporean recording artist Linying, often bring up the “curse of Siargao” — the idea that you come here to lose yourself and then, soon after, lose your fidelity to time and to your life back home, deciding instead to extend your trip again and again as you canoe through mangroves, sing karaoke and eat pork lechon in General Luna, the most built-up area for tourists, and learn to surf at nearby Cloud Nine, host to many global competitions and widely considered to have some of the world’s nicest swells. In fact, it was those barrel waves that first drew intrepid travelers in the 1980s, who named Cloud Nine after a popular Filipino chocolate bar and soon set up hippieish dive bars and hostels where they could party and crash. In 2010, Bobby Dekeyser, a German-Belgian businessman who founded the Filipino-made furniture lineDedon,built the discreet, high-end resort now known as Nay Palad Hideaway, which opened others’ eyes to the island’s potential as a luxurious escape. Then, in 2021, Super Typhoon Odette hit the southern Philippines, destroying much of Siargao, after which its 100,000 or so residents rebuilt in ways that improved their own lives (cellphone service has become less spotty and the roads are now better, although occasional power shortages occur and there’s still no full-scale hospital) and made the place, with a certain ambivalence, more welcoming to visitors. Much of the island’s energy is centered on the aptly named Tourism Road, in General Luna, on Siargao’s southeastern edge. But if you want to really explore, hire a motorboat captain to take you to one of the tinier, barely inhabited islands in the Philippine Sea: You might have a pristine beach entirely to yourself. Or have a tuk-tuk driver bring you to the island’s north, where the real-estate developer Alelee Andanar, who lives between Manila and Siargao, recently launched aninternational artists’ residencyand a by-appointment gallery. “Anyone who gets attached to Siargao enjoys a sense of novelty,” says Linying. “That’s my theory as to why it attracts so many creative people, that ‘best-kept secret’ thing, and the north feels like the encapsulation of that.” Here’s how to enjoy the whole island (and a few off its coast), with recommendations and advice from Dekeyser, Esguerra, Linying and the chef Inês Castañeda.

BySam Sifton Good morning. We hitDel Fiorein Rocky Point for late-morning sandwiches, Italian subs from the northeastern reaches of Brookhaven on Long Island, then pushed west along theWashington Spy Trailtoward Port Jefferson, Setauket, Nissequogue, thinking about cooking all the way. This is the way of the weekends now, when daylight’s fleeting, when afternoons pass in what seems like moments. Dinner comes up fast. I want to be prepared. The debate in my head as I drove:mapo ragù(above) orbutter chicken. I learned how to make the first by following the chefs David Chang and Tien Ho, who served it at Momofuku Ssäm Bar on Second Avenue in Manhattan a million years ago. It’s a meat-sauce mashup of Chinese, Korean and Italian cuisine, sweet-salty and fiery all at once, with tangles of braised kale and plenty of chewy rice cakes to absorb the flavors and fat — an ideal wintertime feast. Featured Recipe View Recipe → But that butter chicken’s no slouch on a Saturday night in December. It’s worth considering, too. The recipe is one that Amandeep Sharma, a line cook at the Melbourne restaurant Attica, served as a staff meal: a curry of tomatoes, butter and chicken thighs scented with onions, ginger, garam masala, cumin, turmeric and cinnamon — Delhi on a plate. I eat it alongside a bowl of basmati rice and think about summer there in Ripponlea, with chattering lorikeets flapping around in the garden outside the restaurant, the whole magical vibe of urban Australia.

Waiting for a Test Result Can Be Brutal. Here’s How to Deal.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/well/test-result-anxiety-tips.html,"Advertisement Subscriber-onlyNewsletter Anxious anticipation is natural, but there are things you can do to ease it. ByMaxwell Strachan Jancee Dunn is out this week. I’m Maxwell Strachan, an editor on the Well desk, filling in today. A few months ago, my wife and I visited a fertility doctor in hopes of receiving a little help in our attempt to have a child. Midway through an ultrasound, in a way that suggested he was seeing something unusual, the doctor asked my wife if she’d had the scan before. It turned out he had found an unidentifiable, large mass in her lower abdomen. Specifically, it looked like it was near one of her ovaries. He told us that we needed to schedule an M.R.I., but not to panic. I went against the latter suggestion. In fact, I spent most of my waking hours freaking out. There were many things the mass could have been — a fibroid or, less likely, a cyst — but I fixated on worse scenarios. Two weeks after the ultrasound, we learned that my wife was fine. She had fibroids, one as large as a grapefruit, but a fixable problem nonetheless. With cancer ruled out, I reflected on how anxious I’d felt, and how I’d been down this road before, when waiting for results from my own medical tests. I wished I’d been better equipped to handle the intervening weeks. Waiting for test results is a common, awful part of life. Research has found that it can be ashard or harderthan receiving an unwelcome diagnosis. That anxious feeling is so common that it has a name, at least in the context of cancer: “scanxiety.” Inevitably, I’ll have to wait for another medical test result again one day, as will almost all of us. So I talked to therapists and doctors to find out how I could handle myself better the next time around. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Exploring the Brazil Where Schnapps and Grappa Flow,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/travel/brazil-rio-grande-do-sul-german-italian.html,"A road trip through Brazil’s Rio Grande do Sul state leads to German and Italian cuisine, dialects and a surprising number of music festivals. The author encountered accordion music and other unexpected delights on a meandering five-day tour through villages with names like Garibaldi and Teutônia.Credit...Gabriela Portilho for The New York Times Supported by BySeth Kugel I had intricately planned my road trip exploring the Italian and German heritage of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil’s southernmost state, to maximize immigrant cuisine, unsung wineries and villages with charming timber-frame buildings. I’d visit Antônio Prado, the self-proclaimed “most Italian city in Brazil,” drive along rural roads lined with hydrangeas, and explore Gramado, a town whose center this time of year resembles an Epcot version of an Alpine ski town, decked out with Santa statues and massive candy canes. But while Gramado’s Christmas parade had its charms and Antônio Prado’s nearly 50 landmark buildings were mesmerizing, unexpected encounters would repeatedly steal the show during my five-day adventure. Take the impromptu concert that started when I pulled my car over one day near a meandering river. A roadside event was clearly winding down — a woman wiped down a long table, a few stragglers drank beer by a makeshift bar, and a handful of kids splashed in the water. A friendly man told me I had just missed a party celebratingthe opening of a bridgeto replace the one that had been damaged bytragic floodsin May. As I explained in Portuguese that I wanted to learn “about the immigrant traditions of the region,” a man grabbed an accordion and gathered members of his musical group — Grupo Náni, slogan: “Keeping Italian Cultures Alive” — to belt out “La Bella Polenta,” an immigrant ode to a cornmeal dish with origins in the Italian province of Veneto. The town mayor, one of the dillydallying drinkers, joined in too, and all were singing in Talian, a language that evolved from Venetian and other Italian dialects that their ancestors brought to this region of Brazil more than 100 years ago.

Murray Milon, Panna II and Royal Bangladesh had occupied 93 First Avenue since the 1980s. By 2024, only Panna II was still in business. Supported by Four windows at the bottom of a brick building in the East Village used to entice passers-by, with string lights and glowing chili peppers as far as the eye could see. Competitive hosts would flank the entryways to three restaurants there, calling out to customers. It was part of the charm: Over decades the South Asian restaurants attracted locals, tourists, Instagram influencers and even celebrities. Today, a red rolldown door covers the lower two windows of what was once the restaurant Royal Bangladesh. A curtain has been drawn across another, where Milon stood. On the second floor, to the right side, justone restaurant, Panna II, has kept its lights on. The glowing storefronts were a sign of a once-vibrant South Asian community, centered around a block known asLittle IndiaorCurry Rowwhere there were dozens of Desi restaurants. Starting out as cheap eats — where you could get a plate of chicken curry and a samosa for $5 during lunchtime — they became neighborhood standbys and even social media-famous hot spots with celebrity sightings. Now, decades after they opened, only one of the storefronts remains. Boshir Khan, 49, the Bangladeshi-born owner of Panna II, which sits on First Avenue just around the corner from the old Curry Row, finds it bittersweet to be the last man standing at the vibrant entryway.

Would You Buy a Perfume You Had Never Smelled?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/style/ffern-perfume.html,"A half-million people are on the Ffern wait list hoping to do just that. A half-million people are on the Ffern wait list hoping to do just that. Owen Mears and Emily Cameron, the British siblings behind the cult fragrance line.Credit...Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times Supported by ByMarisa Meltzer “We have this conviction that fine fragrance is like fine wine,” said Owen Mears, the founder of Ffern, a line of perfumes based in London. “Everybody knows it’s just grapes, but you can’t simply recreate it, because there is craft involved.” He was drinking tea at the Nine Orchard hotel next to his sister, Emily Cameron, Ffern’s creative director. “Our starting point was doing things really differently,” Ms. Cameron said. Undeniably, their perfumes are made and sold in a manner far different from a fragrance you might pick out at a department store or at Sephora. Ffern, which Mr. Mears started in 2016, is a subscription service. A space on the ledger, as it’s called, costs $129 per season and signifies that you want a bottle from the next batch. From then on, you’ll get a new scent four times a year, as the seasons change. Each edition is handmade in small batches in the English countryside from ingredients that are 95 percent natural and aged in barrels. Each scent is produced only for that season, never to be made again, incentivizing subscribers to make sure they collect each precious release. That may explain the wait list. The number of spots on the ledger are limited, and once it’s full, you have to wait for a space to open up. According to the company, the wait list has half a million people on it, and 20,000 people add their names each week. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Looking for Friends? Start With Family.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/well/family/in-law-best-friend.html,"Advertisement Supported by How a brother-in-law became my best friend. ByTom Vanderbilt Friends, it is often said, are the family you choose. But sometimes, it goes the other way. I met my brother-in-law, Rob, more than 20 years ago, when I was dating my now-wife and he was engaged to her sister. We were soon bumping into each other at family gatherings, and despite some slight differences, we bonded over a shared set of interests (’80s alternative music, John le Carré novels,soccer) and the fact that we were both outsiders navigating a family that was not our own. Once we were official brothers-in-law, those gatherings became more frequent, and Rob’s presence was always an underlying draw, as we’d escape from the house to shoot hoops after Thanksgiving dinner or Christmas lunch. Our bond deepened when he and his wife, Heather, moved from Boston to the Catskills a few years later to open a restaurant, and my wife and I bought a small house nearby. I found myself helping out with their new business most weekends, evenpitching in to cookwhen he was in a jam. Neither that restaurant, nor that house, proved lasting, but what has endured is our friendship, one that reaches beyond easy familiarity and proximity at holidays. Lately, amid the widespread reports of aloneliness epidemic— particularlyamong men— I’ve been newly grateful for Rob, and reminded of a somewhat overlooked idea: Among your pool of in-laws you may find a new best friend, hiding in plain sight. Out of the research that exists about family relationships, in-laws tend to receive scant attention — and brothers-in-law are practically invisible. (One of the few studies I could find — from Denmark — concluded that having a brother-in-law with a criminal record made one slightly more likely to gain a criminal record as well.) But in-laws are interesting. In a big-picture evolutionary sense, “affines,” as in-laws are called among researchers, don’t seem all that different from blood relations. As one team ofanthropologists noted, “people treat affines as biological kin rather than unrelated friends.” One reason is that despite not being genetically linked, they tend to have, like any family member, “a common genetic interest in future generations.” Gretchen Perry, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Northern British Columbia, said the connection might explain the altruistic bent Rob and I seemed to have toward each other, inside or outside of a restaurant kitchen.

An Easy Holiday Manicure With a Secret Ingredient,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/t-magazine/simple-holiday-manicure.html,"Advertisement Supported by On Beauty The nail artist Mei Kawajiri shares a festive nail design you can recreate at home in just five steps, using products you probably already own. ByNia Decaille “Sometimes I want to take three hours to do a detailed design,” says the New York-based nail artistMei Kawajiri, who has created elaborate custom looks for pop stars such as Tyla, Dua Lipa and Sabrina Carpenter. But while Kawajiri is well known for her 3-D manicures, adorned with everything from miniature teddy bears to dollops of caviar, she also understands the power of what she calls a pared-down “good idea.” Here, she demonstrates how to accomplish a festive version of “aura nails” — which feature gradient color accents against a solid base — using just a handful of products including, perhaps surprisingly, eye shadow. Starting with clean, dry and oil-free hands, apply two coats of a sheer base color to your nails. Kawajiri recommends Manucurist’sGreen natural polishin Hortencia to create “a rosy look.” Let the polish dry forat least five minutes.Then, add one layer of a matte polish; Kawajiri suggests Manucurist’sGreen Perfecting Matte Base Coat. The combination of sheer and matte varnishes will give your manicure an even and primed base against which your design can pop. Let the nails dry completely, which should take five to 10 minutes. You can speed things up with aportable electric fanor an elegant folded option, like Duvelleroy’sSignature Fashion Fan. Simply “sticking your hand out the window” will also suffice, says Kawajiri — just don’t reach for a hair dryer or anything else that uses heat, which can distort the polish. For an unexpected accent, repurpose your favorite eye shadow or blush. Kawajiri recommends a bright shade, and among her favorites are Haus Labs by Lady Gaga’s range ofColor Fuseblushes and those in Isamaya’sIndustrial Color Pigments 2.0 palette; Pat McGrath’sLuminous Legends: Mega Eye Shadowpalettecontains other vibrant options. Rub your pigment of choice into each nail with an applicator in a circular motion, starting in the middle of the nail. Kawajiri encourages trying multiple shimmering or bright shades for an ombré look or adding eye shadow to only the tip of the nail, for a twist on a classic French manicure. For beginners, shimmer shades may be easier to apply than mattes; the borders don’t need to be as precise. Whichever product you choose, you can edit and clean up your design with a Q-Tip dipped in rubbing alcohol. Seal your look with a layer of a topcoat such asDior’sor the more budget-friendly version fromSeche Vite, which Kawajiri recommends. Follow with a swipe of cuticle oil, such as Chanel’sL’Huile Camélia,to add extra shine to the nails.

This is all to say, there will be takeout tonight. As much as I love cooking on a night in — often desperately needed given all of the restaurant going — it’s not always tenable. This month especially, between office holiday parties and cookie swaps and white elephant exchanges, I’m craving being home on my couch and eating food someone else cooked. Get thee to the couch with a throw blanket, tip your delivery person more than the app suggests, and consider these suggestions to accompany the new season of Netflix’s “The Ultimatum.” A delivery order fromBunna Cafein Bushwick comes in what looks like a pizza box adorned with their logo (an illustration of a jebena, the pottery used to brew Arabic coffee), and the thrill of opening it is unmatched.

They’ve gotinstructionson their website to set you up for success: Unroll one of the springy injera, and spoon some of each dish on.

A museum outing here, a dance performance there and a slate of restaurant reservations at the hottest tickets in town — I have none of these on the agenda. What I do have, however, is a list of recipes I want to make with them. The operative word here being “with.” My mom and brother will be my sous-chefs, chopping and stirring, shouting out instructions and gently nosing the dog away from the shredded cheese that has fallen on the floor. Which brings me to my first group project: vegetarian lasagna. Specifically Alexa Weibel’svegetarian lasagna Bolognese, which uses a richvegan Bolognesebuilt on walnuts and mushrooms. I might swap in Ali Slagle’svegetarian Bolognese, though. Her recipe adds cauliflower to the traditional soffritto mix to bulk up the sauce, and I’m on a mission to convince my brother that cauliflower is actually delicious — employing it as the backbone of his favorite sauce in his favorite dish feels like a good way to go. View this recipe. I’ve also promised my mom a hand-pulled noodle night. I’m a big fan ofVivian Chan-Tam’s recipe(withvideo), which produces wonderfully chewy ribbons to coat with your sauce and toppings of choice. Will our noodles turn out picture-perfect? Probably not! But I can say from experience that even the wonkiest, irregular hand-pulled noodles are still delicious, especially when tossed withchile crispand a snowfall of scallions.

How to Make Sense of the Fluoride Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/well/fluoride-water-health-pregnancy-children.html,"Advertisement Supported by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he wants to curb water fluoridation nationwide. Here’s what the science shows about the benefits and the risks. ByMelinda Wenner Moyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s skepticism about fluoride has become a focal point in the debate about whether he’s suitable to run the nation’s health department. Hispledgethat the Trump administration would “advise all U.S. systems to remove fluoride from public water” has sparked outcry among dentists and some public health experts who say that fluoridated water is safe and essential for protecting oral health in children. But other medical experts have raised concerns about the potential negative health effects of high levels of fluoride, particularly for fetuses and young children. This isn’t the first time concerns about fluoride have cropped up: Opposition to fluoride dates back to the 1940s and ’50s. At that time, some people felt that more studies were needed to establish the safety of water fluoridation. In addition, unfounded conspiracy theories — like that fluoridation was a Communist plot to poison Americans — began to spread. Skepticism about fluoride became so associated with fringe worldviews that it became a kind of punchline. But the research shows a more nuanced picture of fluoride’s benefits and risks. Here’s what to know. The greatest benefit of fluoride is that it improves children’s oral health. The mineral prevents cavities bymakingteeth stronger and may also reduce the amount of acid that bacteria on the teeth produce, which can damage enamel and make them more susceptible to cavities.

Supromesade que el gobierno de Trump “aconsejaría a todos los sistemas estadounidenses que eliminaran el flúor del agua pública” ha desatado la indignación entre los dentistas y algunos expertos en salud pública que afirman que el agua fluorada es segura y esencial para proteger la salud bucodental de los niños. Pero otros expertos médicos han expresado su preocupación por los posibles efectos negativos para la salud de los altos niveles de flúor, en particular para los fetos y los niños pequeños. No es la primera vez que surgen dudas sobre el flúor: su oposición se remonta a las décadas de 1940 y 1950. En aquella época, algunas personas consideraban que se necesitaban más estudios para establecer la seguridad de la fluoración del agua. Además, empezaron a extenderse teorías conspirativas infundadas, como que la fluoración era un complot comunista para envenenar a los estadounidenses.

Perfect Instant Ramen,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/dining/perfect-instant-ramen.html,"Advertisement Newsletter That’s what you get when you add an egg, a pat of butter and a slice or two of American cheese to a bowl of steaming noodles. ByMia Leimkuhler In 2021, I asked a bunch of chefs and food personalities abouttheir favorite instant ramenfor New York Magazine’s The Strategist. Lucas Kwan Peterson, the former food columnist for The Los Angeles Times, astutely pointed out that “there’s usually (but not always) a direct correlation between the number of sachets of different things — oils, sauces, powders, dried veggies — included in a package and how good it is. The more, the better!” But what if the instant ramen you have is basic — just noodles and a powdered seasoning packet? You can still haveperfect instant ramen, thanks to this recipe of the same name by Roy Choi, adapted by Jeff Gordinier. “Slide an egg into the hot broth, then some butter,” Jeff writes. “Crown the steaming noodles with slices of American cheese. Scatter a bunch of toasted sesame seeds and chopped scallions across the top, if you want to.” The butter, egg and cheese, he explains, coat the curly noodles and boost the umami levels of the dish. (The “slide an egg in” move was mentioned several times in my article as a favorite way to doctor up a bowl of instant noodles. Leave your go-to tricks in the comments!)

I have Yasmin Fahr’sskillet ginger chicken with apricotson my to-cook list, and while the recipe as written sounds pretty perfect, I’m intrigued by her suggestion to try dried figs or prunes in place of the dried apricots. I would also add even more baby spinach, because it always reduces down to practically nothing and I could use a little extra greenage. Maybe it’s a reaction to the Main Dish Moment thrust upon us by Thanksgiving, but I find myself gravitating toward fun, star-billing vegetable dishes to serve with simple proteins.Yotam Ottolenghi’s new saladtakes full advantage of the in-season (and inexpensive) cabbage and mandarin oranges that are crowding my corner grocer.

Either recipe would be really nice with a pan ofseared salmon. Lastly, one thing that always invites cheffy tinkering is a bunch of overripe bananas. Will they becomebanana bread?Banana pancakes? Or maybe Samantha Seneviratne’schocolate banana muffinsare in order, seeing as they can pull double duty for breakfast and dessert. “For an extra special treat, warm halved muffins in a skillet with a pat of butter and sprinkle with a bit of kosher salt,” Sam suggests. “A swipe of cream cheese wouldn’t hurt either.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ByEric Asimov I’ve had the privilege of drinking some wonderful wines this year, including a few rare, breathtakingly gorgeous old bottles. Those are often the ones that stick in the memory, the experiences that you carry around as benchmarks of beauty. But I drank a lot of memorable wines that were not so rare, old or hard to find. This year, as I considered which bottles to include in myyear-endlist, I decided to focus on 12 younger, more accessible bottles along with a couple of middle-aged examples.

From the outside, the new exclusive-use, three-bedroom property opening Dec. 15 looks more like a gondola station than it does a luxury chalet. The geometric fortress of concrete, galvanized steel, chimneys and solar panels sits solitary on a rocky ridge atop the ancient Tortin Glacier at an elevation of 9,500 feet. Its cantilevered glass windows reflect the surrounding pink alpenglow and bluebird skies that the 4 Vallées Ski area — Switzerland’s largest, including Verbier — is known for. Inside, the mind-clearing Scandinavian minimalism of the Norwegian architect Snorre Stinessen focuses on the elements with a blond wood grain ceiling, sauna and log fireplace. The ski-in, ski-out accessibility is off-piste, ensuring discreet and quick getaways.

Fukasawa-designed fashion accessories, home décor of all kinds, appliances and technology are on view alongside working sketches and models. One of his newest designs is a casing that transforms an Apple watch into a tabletop clock resembling his boxy first-generation mobile phone, also on view, from 2003. In another display, juice boxes conjure not just the colors but also the textures of the fruits inside. And his Pao lamps, created for the Danish housewares company Hay, take their shape and name from the dwellings of nomadic groups in Central Asia (paois Japanese for “yurt”). Fukasawa, born in 1956, is also the director of Tokyo’s folk craft museum known asthe Mingeikanand a co-founder of21_21 Design Sight, Japan’s first design museum. The curator Colin Fanning has organized the show thematically according to the designer’s guiding principles, which include longevity, accessibility, humility, sustainability, friendliness and subtle humor. Speaking from his studio in Tokyo, Fukasawa highlighted another key attribute: While he’s known as “the detail king,” he says, he aims for his designs to “function without thinking” as if there were “a hidden communication happening.”“Naoto Fukasawa: Things in Themselves” is on view from Dec. 13 through April 20, 2025;philamuseum.org. See This ByJuan A. Ramírez The artist Patrick Quarm considers himself a social archaeologist. Since moving from Ghana to Texas in 2015 for his master’s degree, he has learned to navigate various cultural spaces, and his eye for fitting into — or sticking out of — his surroundings informs his latest show at the Albertz Benda gallery in New York. The exhibit, titled “Phantoms in Familiar Terrains,” is a collection of mixed-media, highly fragmented portraits. Some, like his “Specimen” works (2024), show their subjects unraveling, threads emerging from painted canvas that’s framed within wooden vitrines. Other pieces obscure aspects of what’s shown: in “Echoes of Then and Now” (2024), the silhouettes of figures are depicted only as colorful gradients, with a few key features, like faces or hands, rendered on smaller canvases jutting out of the main painting. Quarm references his home country through his materials, using African wax fabrics sourced from local Ghanaian markets to dress his characters and placing them in inviting tropical hangouts. The artist splits his time between his hometown, Takoradi, and New Haven, Conn., and draws on the friends and family that he’s photographed between the two countries for his paintings. “I’m constantly looking for individuals living within that cultural third space, or that have a hybrid identity going on within them,” Quarm says. “Phantoms in Familiar Terrains” is on view from Dec. 12 through Feb. 1,albertzbenda.com.

How to Talk to Your Teen About Pornography,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/health/pornography-adolescents-internet.html,"Advertisement Supported by Odds are your adolescent has already encountered online pornography. Your role is to openly address it, scholars say. ByMatt Richtel The average American first sees online pornography at age 12, and nearly three-quarters of all teenagers have encountered it, according toa 2023 survey of adolescents by Common Sense. It’s enough to make most any parent squirm, but Brian Willoughby, a social scientist at Brigham Young University who studies the pornography habits of adolescents and the impact on relationships, has some advice: “Don’t panic.” Instead, he says, help your child understand that “this is a normal and acceptable topic, even if you’re stressed out.” Here are some suggestions for how to broach the subject: First, try to take some of the intense emotion — yours and your child’s — out of the conversation. “Start with helping them feel calm and validated,” Dr. Willoughby said. “They can’t have a conversation with you if they are feeling strong emotions.” Then, he said, “assess their reaction to porn — were they excited, disgusted, attracted, disinterested? — and make them feel safe sharing this with you.” That shared trust forms the basis for a next step, he said: “Tie your own values into the conversation. Share what your view of porn is and why.” He noted that adolescents crave a clear explanation, not merely a pronouncement that pornography is “wrong.” Dr. Willoughby suggested that parents “talk through some of the details of porn to point out problems with expectations and intimate behaviors” and then “tie these thoughts and views to your overall hopes and values about sexual intimacy.” Numerous phone and computer apps offer help blocking pornographic content. These can “potentially buy a few years of protection” if loaded on a child’s phone and other devices, said Melea Stephens, a family therapist in Alabama who speaks to universities, legislators and church groups about the harm that exposure to pornography can present to children and teenagers. Despite such barriers, studies indicate that most young people will stumble across the content or find their way to it. At that point, Ms. Stephens said, parents should take their adolescent aside and “explain the difference between a real, loving, mutually respectful romantic relationship and the destructive dynamics and meta-messages being depicted in pornography.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Leer en español,https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/12/12/espanol/estilos-de-vida/hablar-de-pornografia-hijo-adolescente.html,"The New YorkTimes en Español Advertisement Supported by Lo más probable es que tu hijo ya haya visto pornografía en internet. Tu papel es abordarla abiertamente, dicen los expertos. PorMatt Richtel El estadounidense promedio ve pornografía en internet por primera vez a los 12 años, y casi tres cuartas partes de todos los adolescentes se han topado con ella, según una encuesta realizada a adolescentes en2023 por Common Sense. Es suficiente para hacer que cualquier padre se escandalice, pero Brian Willoughby, un científico social de la Universidad Brigham Young que estudia los hábitos pornográficos de los adolescentes y su impacto en las relaciones, tiene algunos consejos: “Que no cunda el pánico”. En lugar de eso, dice, ayuda a tu hijo a entender que “es un tema normal y aceptable, aunque tú estés estresado”. He aquí algunas sugerencias para abordar el tema. En primer lugar, intenta eliminar parte de la intensa emoción —tuya y de tu hijo— de la conversación. “Empieza por ayudarles a sentirse tranquilos y validados”, dijo Willoughby. “No pueden mantener una conversación contigo si están sintiendo emociones fuertes”. A continuación, dijo, “evalúa su reacción ante el porno: ¿les excitó, les disgustó, les atrajo, les desinteresó?, y haz que se sientan seguros compartiéndolo contigo”. Esa confianza compartida constituye la base para el siguiente paso, dijo: “Incorpora tus propios valores a la conversación. Comparte cuál es tu opinión sobre el porno y por qué”. Señaló que los adolescentes ansían una explicación clara, no una mera declaración de que la pornografía está “mal”. Willoughby sugirió que los padres “hablen de algunos de los detalles de la pornografía para señalar los problemas con las expectativas y los comportamientos íntimos” y luego “vinculen estos pensamientos y puntos de vista a sus esperanzas y valores generales sobre la intimidad sexual”. Numerosas aplicaciones para teléfonos y computadoras ofrecen ayuda para bloquear contenidos pornográficos. Estas pueden “comprar potencialmente unos cuantos años de protección” si se cargan en el teléfono y otros dispositivos de un niño, dijo Melea Stephens, una terapeuta familiar de Alabama que habla con universidades, legisladores y grupos eclesiásticos sobre el daño que la exposición a la pornografía puede representar para niños y adolescentes. A pesar de estas barreras, los estudios indican que la mayoría de los jóvenes tropiezan con el contenido o encuentran el camino hacia él. En ese momento, dijo Stephens, los padres deberían llevar a su hijo adolescente aparte y “explicarle la diferencia entre una relación romántica real, amorosa y mutuamente respetuosa y la dinámica destructiva y los metamensajes que se muestran en la pornografía”. Una de las principales preocupaciones de los expertos es que ver pornografía dé a los espectadores más jóvenes ideas erróneas de lo que pueden esperar de las relaciones sexuales. Los niños y los adolescentes pueden no reconocer que lo que están viendo no es una guía, un documental o una visión realista del sexo y la intimidad.

"It’s Time to Talk About Pornography, Scholars Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/science/pornography-adolescents-teenagers.html,"Advertisement Supported by More adolescents than ever are watching it. What’s needed, researchers say, are frank conversations and “porn literacy.” ByMatt Richtel Brian Willoughby knows he’s doing a good job when parents become uncomfortable. That’s because part of his job involves telling them that their teenagers are looking at pornography — hard-core, explicit, often violent. Sometimes, the conversation is with a church group. Dr. Willoughby is a social scientist at Brigham Young University, where he studies the pornography habits of adolescents and the impact this has on relationships. When he goes into the community to explain what the modern world is like, he speaks plainly. “I always have to be careful to couch things by saying, ‘I’m not saying porn is good — but I am saying it’s a reality,’” he said. “You can stick your head in the sand and pretend it doesn’t exist, and say this is bad and pray harder, or use addiction language, but you have to have a realistic understanding of what’s happening.” In the past, many parents have tried to ignore the watching of pornography by their children, forbid its use or wish it away. But scholars who study the adolescent use of online pornography say that the behavior is so commonplace and impossible to prevent that a more pragmatic approach is required. When it comes to pornography, they want us to talk about it. The aim: to teach adolescents that the explicit content they encounter is unrealistic, misleading about many sexual relations and, as a result, potentially harmful. The approach does not condone the content or encourage its use, Dr. Willoughby emphasized, but acknowledges its ubiquity and unrealistic, hard-core nature. Long gone are the days of nude magazines that left much to the imagination. “That was nudity, sexualized,” Dr. Willoughby said of the pornography of yesteryear. “A lot of parents still think that porn is Playboy.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Lo que hace falta, dicen quienes investigan sobre el tema, son conversaciones francas y “alfabetización pornográfica”. PorMatt Richtel Brian Willoughby sabe que está haciendo un buen trabajo cuando los padres se sienten incómodos. Eso se debe a que parte de su trabajo consiste en decirles que sus hijos adolescentes miran pornografía, dura, explícita y a menudo violenta. A veces, la conversación es con un grupo de la iglesia. Willoughby es científico social en la Universidad Brigham Young, donde estudia los hábitos pornográficos de los adolescentes y el impacto que esto tiene en las relaciones. Cuando va a la comunidad para explicar cómo es el mundo moderno, habla sin rodeos. “Siempre tengo que tener cuidado de expresar las cosas diciendo: ‘No digo que la pornografía sea buena, pero sí que es una realidad’”, dijo. “Puedes meter la cabeza en la arena y hacer como si no existiera, y decir que esto es malo y rezar más, o utilizar el lenguaje de la adicción, pero tienes que tener una comprensión realista de lo que está ocurriendo”. En el pasado, muchos padres han intentado ignorar que sus hijos ven pornografía, prohibir su uso o desear que desaparezca. Pero los eruditos que estudian el uso adolescente de la pornografía en internet afirman que el comportamiento es tan habitual e imposible de prevenir que se requiere un enfoque más pragmático. Cuando se trata de pornografía, quieren que hablemos de ella. El objetivo: enseñar a los adolescentes que el contenido explícito que encuentran es poco realista, engañoso sobre muchas relaciones sexuales y, en consecuencia, potencialmente perjudicial. El planteamiento no aprueba el contenido ni fomenta su utilización, subrayó Willoughby, sino que reconoce su ubicuidad y su naturaleza irreal y dura.

The Pistachio Martini Is Beloved. And Baffling.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/dining/drinks/pistachio-martini.html,"Advertisement Supported by The creamy, pastel green drink is an enigma, but that doesn’t stop bartenders across the country from adding it to their menus. ByKorsha Wilson AtCaffé Vittoriain the North End of Boston, a drink arrives in a conical glass, a scoop of pistachio ice cream melting into the light green liquid. Served with a demitasse spoon, its taste falls somewhere between dessert and a boozy cocktail. It’s the pistachio martini, beloved in this part of the city, where chalkboard signs spill onto the street announcing its presence on menus. But scratch below its frothy surface and what emerges are more questions than answers — not to mention a healthy dose of skepticism from cocktail snobs. What is a pistachio martini? Why are there so many versions? And why is something that effectively tastes like melted ice cream so popular? In the North End, bartenders are quick to credit the drink’s popularity in the heavily Italian American neighborhood to its connection to Italy. But pistachios aren’t Italian. They actually originate in the Middle East, and, although it’s a popular flavor in Italy and Sicilian pistachios arehighly prized,Italy isn’t one of the nut’s top growers: Iran, Turkey and the United States all produce more.

Could Cats Become a Carrier of Bird Flu?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/health/bird-flu-h5n1-cats.html,"Bird Flu Advertisement Supported by A new study highlights the need for public health officials to ramp up bird flu surveillance in our feline companions. ByEmily AnthesandApoorva Mandavilli Domestic cats could provide an unexpected new route for the bird flu virus H5N1 to evolve into a more dangerous form, according toa new studypublished on Monday. In the year since the virus began circulating in dairy cattle, it has killed many cats, primarily on farms with affected herds. It has also sickened at least 60 people, most of whom had close contact with infected dairy cows or poultry. So far, H5N1 does not spread easily among people, although studies have suggested that justone or two key mutationscould allow the virus to make that leap. There is no evidence that cats have spread H5N1 to people and they may not represent a major avenue for the evolution of bird flu, experts said. Still, if a cat were simultaneously infected with H5N1 and a seasonal flu virus, the H5N1 virus could potentially acquire the mutations it needed to spread efficiently among people. The new study highlights the need for public health officials to ramp up bird flu surveillance in cats, which tend to have frequent contact with both wild animals and people, said Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, a veterinary microbiologist at the University of Pittsburgh and an author of the paper. For months,the testing of cows and people for H5N1has been limited, leaving experts in the dark about the true scale of the dairy outbreak. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that it would begintesting the national milk supplyto help identify infected herds. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Sticky Toffee Pudding Is the Best Low-Stress Holiday Dessert,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/magazine/sticky-toffee-pudding-holiday-dessert-recipe.html,"Holiday Season Advertisement Supported by Time is precious. Let this treat do some of the work. ByYotam Ottolenghi Remaining festive over the festive season can require a game plan. Contrary to what rom-coms might suggest, making the good times roll isnotalways a lark. The expectations of kids to be surprised, the traditions of extended family and their need to be delighted, the pressures of the season more generally: Accommodating all these can be alot. I read a brilliant book this year called “Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals.” The author, Oliver Burkeman, says a lot of useful things, but — beyond the mind-focusing fact that, assuming that we live to be 80, then 4,000 weeks is what we’ve got — I had one key takeaway. As important as deciding what you aregoing to do with your time — your day, your week, your year, your life — is deciding what you are not going to do. Because once you’ve decided what you’re notgoing to do, there’s no point berating yourself for the consequences of not doing it. As the end of the year gets packed, we all have different things we’re not going to do. We might decide not to see every single person we know and love, or we might decide that we don’t need to be the last person standing at every party we attend. There is no point feeling guilty or worrying about not being part of the crazy fun thing that happened, for example, if you choose to lie low. It’s like the opposite of a New Year’s resolution — and decidedly more doable as a result. And so to festive food. It is no surprise that I am generally expected, whether as host or guest, to actually make the dishes I’m serving or taking somewhere — “make” as in start with eggs and flour and butter and sugar, when the end result is to be cake. I’m generally a very happy baker, but this can feel like pressure. I’ve always admired the French custom of proudly, unapologetically picking up patisserie from a shop when entertaining or contributing to a meal. Why get the kitchen counter covered in a sheet of flour when the alternative is a perfectly wonderful gâteau from a clean cardboard box (and the most precious gift of all: some bonus free time)? At this time of the year, many in France will be strutting down the street with their bûche de Noël, the traditional Yule log, in hand. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Ultraprocessed Foods Are Everywhere. Our 5-Day Challenge Will Help You Spot Them.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/well/eat/ultraprocessed-food-challenge-signup.html,"Advertisement Supported by Try these simple steps for a healthier 2025. ByJancee Dunn Close your eyes and imagine a shopping cart full of ultraprocessed foods. Yes, it probably contains items like potato chips and hot dogs. But ultraprocessed foods is a wide-ranging category that also includes foods you might associate with nutritious eating, like many whole grain breads, breakfast cereals and flavored yogurts. This can make recognizing them confusing. Ultraprocessed foods are commonly defined as any foods or drinks made with ingredients you wouldn’t typically find in a home kitchen. These include artificial flavors, synthetic food dyes, hydrogenated oils, and emulsifiers that help blend ingredients that don’t normally mix (like oil and water). About58 percent of the American dietis ultraprocessed. And scientists have found associations between ultraprocessed foods anda number of health conditions, including heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and mental health issues like anxiety and depression. So are ultraprocessed foods worth eliminating from your diet? Let us help you figure it out. On Jan. 6, 2025, we’ll kick off a week of evidence-based tips and that will help you understand more about ultraprocessed foods: What’s in them? How can you identify them?

Frog Club Ends Life as It Began: Strangely,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/dining/frog-club-nyc-closes.html,"Advertisement Supported by The lurid collapse of its chef’s previous project fueled a fascination that made the New York restaurant impossible to get into. Or so it seemed for a while. ByPete Wells Froggy, we hardly knew ye. Frog Club, the West Village restaurant known for its ban on photography, its $1,000 “kiss the chef” menu special and other eccentricities, announced Monday on Instagram that it would cease operations this weekend after 10 months in our dimension. Though its life was brief, the questions it raised will last. Years from now, when people who ate at Frog Club happen to meet, they will ask one another, “What was that all about?” For a few weeks after it went into business in February, the restaurant was the only topic anybody I knew wanted to talk about. Its internet game was superb. By way of an opening announcement, it simply posteda deadpan parodyof the “Great Chefs” series that ran on PBS in the 1980s, with a solemn narrator proclaiming that Frog Club’s chef, Liz Johnson, was “one of the early principals in the New Nostalgia craze.” The restaurant’swebsitegave almost nothing away. Aside from a photograph of the front door at 86 Bedford Street with what seemed to be an animated frog peeping out from behind a barred opening, the only information offered was an email address for reservations. Less than a month later, the address disappeared. Early dinersreportedthat a doorman on the sidewalk wearing a watch coat and green ascot would turn anyone away who didn’t have a reservation. If you were on the list, Frog Club stickers were pasted over the lens of your phone. Inside was a flickering gas fireplace, amphibian murals by the illustratorNormandie Sykenin a sort-of-Sorel styleand a hand-cranked press that spat out souvenir pennies. The menu, echoing the old Walter Winchell line about the Stork Club, said, “Frog Club is the New Yorkiest room in New York.” One of the cocktails was a pulpy green Bloody Mary called the Dirty Kermit. This goofing around was in marked contrast to the serious charges and countercharges that attended the demise of Ms. Johnson’s last restaurant, Horses.The New York Times reportedin 2023 that she had accused Will Aghajanian, her estranged husband and business partner, “of assaulting her, visiting prostitutes and torturing a number of pet kittens to death.” For his part, Mr. Aghajanian “accused her of threatening to kill him and deliberately burning him with kitchen implements.” Each denied the other’s claims, which werefirst reportedin The Los Angeles Times.

Health Panel Endorses New Option for Cervical Cancer Screening,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/health/cervical-cancer-screening.html,"Advertisement Supported by Starting at 30, women can collect their own vaginal samples for HPV testing at a doctor’s office. ByRoni Caryn Rabin Doctors routinely advise that women undergoing screening for cervical cancer receive Pap smears every three years beginning at age 21. Now, beginning at 30, women have a new option. Instead of undergoing a pelvic exam, these patients may go to a doctor’s office and collect their own vaginal sample to be tested for human papillomavirus, the infection that causes most cases of cervical cancer, according tonew guidelinesissued on Tuesday by a national health services panel. Self-collection of the sample was approved in May by the Food and Drug Administration. The HPV test should be repeated every five years from age 30 until 65, when most women can stop screening, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said. Other screening options for those 30 and older include continuing with Pap tests every three years, or a combined Pap smear and HPV test every five years, the task force said. But an HPV test every five years is the ideal screening method, providing the best balance of risks to benefits. The new recommendations apply to women and anyone who was assigned female at birth and still has a cervix, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated against HPV. The advice was issued amid growing concern about a falloff in cancer screenings, and confusion resulting from changes over time in screening regimens and tests used for early detection and prevention of cervical cancer.

Michael White Returns With Santi in a Familiar Space,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html,"Advertisement Supported by Off the Menu Chez Fifi serves tastes of Spain by way of Paris, Fleur brings Shanghainese to Park Slope and more restaurant news. ByFlorence Fabricant The chef Michael White’s influence remained on several restaurants for years after he left New York to pursue opportunities in Florida, the Bahamas and elsewhere with his BBianco Hospitality Group. Now he’s back in the same location as Alto, his former flagship. Italy is his focus in a space with several dining areas done in neutral tones. Pastas like busiate with saffron and uni, and garganelli with Nantucket bay scallops; crudos, including one with Montauk red shrimp; and plates of pan-roasted squab, monkfish with speck, and a veal chop that pays homage to his years at San Domenico, in Italy, highlight the menu. (Opens Thursday) 520 Madison Avenue (53rd Street),santinyc.com. Occupying an Upper East Side townhouse, this French restaurant is no casual bistro. The intimate dining room, finished in polished mahogany, mirrors and drapery, has an à la carte menu by the executive chef Zack Zeidman, who worked with Ignacio Mattos. Inspired by Paris, he also offers tastes of Spain. Escargots, foie gras terrine and Basque txangurro baked crab are starter options to follow with Dover sole à la plancha, roast chicken or filet mignon au poivre. The second floor lounge, Salon de Fifi, is for small bites and drinks. The restaurateurs and brothers Joshua and David Foulquier, a chef who also works on the menu, who are honoring their mother with this restaurant. They also own the Michelin two-star Sushi Noz nearby. 140 East 74th Street,chezfifinyc.com. This elaborate restaurant is inspired by Epang Palace, a Qin Dynasty behemoth that was started in 212 B.C.E. near Xian, never finished, destroyed, rebuilt in the 20th century and destroyed again. Though more modest in size, with 4,200 square feet on two floors and 180 seats, Upon the Palace also strives for imperial opulence. The executive chef, Xueliang Yu, brings a contemporary outlook to his extensive menu of Chinese dishes with king salmon tartare; whole lobster with ginger and scallions; scallops with foie gras; and sushi, along with a routine list of dim sum, dan dan noodles, beef with broccoli, and sweet and sour pork. 317 Greenwich Street (Reade Street), 646-454-1755,uponthepalace.com. Old Shanghai drives the décor here, and a mix of old and new governs the food from the executive chef, Qingkui Feng, who comes from a family of that city’s chefs. Soup dumplings, braised pork belly and Shanghai style noodles are to be expected, but less common are stir-fried shredded eel, crispy anchovies and Shanghai smoked fish. Vintage posters cover the walls and crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling. Hupo, a Sichuan spot in Long Island City, has the same owners. 392 Fifth Avenue (Sixth Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn, 718-534-0110,fleur.cafe. Like the Office of Mr. Moto in the East Village, this sibling also honors a 19th century fictional traveler who went to Japan. Vintage artifacts decorate the various dining areas and butler bells are poised to summon waiters. The executive chef and partner, Tomo Kubo, who is also responsible for the Office and Tabe Tomo among others, is working with the chef Ryan Nitzkowski to serve kaisen-don, a seafood bowl that has a 60-hour broth chaser that’s made like anexquisite corpse. Other bowls, sushi, chawanmushi, miso cod and bonito tataki are also options; there’s a varied array of drinks. 186 Grand Street (Bedford Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn,residenceofmrmoto.com.

The 16 Best Cookbooks of 2024,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/dining/best-cookbooks.html,"Best of 2024 Advertisement Supported by Encyclopedic approaches to plant-based cooking and to cookies, a TikToker’s debut and more, as tested by New York Times Cooking and the Food desk. ByTanya Sichynsky When so much of modern living forces us to peer down at a screen, there’s a lot to be said for a cookbook. It won’t blast you with blue light or exacerbate your tech neck; it won’t inundate you with notifications or unskippable ads. If you let it, it will feed you and whomever you choose, and the best ones do so with vibrant photography, clear instructions and an extra serving of whimsy. We want to help you find those best ones, so members of our Food and Cooking staff read and cooked from dozens of cookbooks published this year. Below are 16 titles that deserve to be toted home from your favorite bookstore — gifts, if you’re feeling generous — to be earmarked, sauce-splattered and used again and again. Kiano Moju’s debut cookbook, “AfriCali” (Simon Element), beams with the generosity of someone who loves cooking for others and the confidence of a multicultural cook who knows how to make just a few ingredients taste phenomenal. That same confidence makes her a comforting guide through the well-spiced, lusciously sauced recipes, which celebrate a Californian approach to modern African cooking. With each recipe, I learned something new or saw something familiar in a different light. Have you ever braised short ribs with berbere, the Ethiopian spice blend? Or infused ghee, the clarified butter, with green cardamom pods and dried oregano? It’ll change your life.ERIC KIM What we made: Roast Chicken With Poussin Sauce (Page 116); Spiced Ghee (Page 235) Paola Velez, a pastry chef and Milk Bar veteran, has put together a vibrant and straight-up fun cookbook featuring desserts influenced by the Afro-Caribbean cuisines of her Bronx childhood. “Bodega Bakes” (Union Square & Co.) is packed with clever mash-ups like plantain sticky buns, sorrel snickerdoodles, guava lemon bars and coquito cheesecake, a big hit in an office of cooking editors. With its eye-popping colors and design, Ms. Velez’s book might look like yet another pretty edition bound for the coffee table. But her recipes are clear and concise, and they work, making it a great find for bakers of any level.MARGAUX LASKEY What we made: OG Chocolate Chip Thick ’Ems (Page 33), Dominican Cake (Page 131), Coquito Cheesecake (Page 159) We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

At Penny, Pete Wells writes, “some of the smartest seafood cooking in the city takes place behind the long counter of this skinny room.”Credit...Colin Clark for The New York Times Supported by ByPete WellsMelissa ClarkandPriya Krishna Stop me if you’ve heard this one: Three critics walk into a restaurant … I know. The chef didn’t think it was funny, either. But it took three of us to stay on top ofNew York City’s dining scenein 2024. Since August, when Ibowed out as restaurant criticto spend some quality time with my blood-pressure cuff, Melissa Clark and Priya Krishna have been serving as interim critics. Each of us had a hand in this roundup of the year’s best restaurants. Most of these places have been reviewed by one of us, although there are a few that nobody has gotten around to just yet. All have opened since last fall, except for one that’s been frying chicken wings and whole snappers on Staten Island since 2021. I’ll take the blame for being so slow to get to Shaw-naé’s House, but I wouldn’t have missed it for anything. I imagine Melissa and Priya feel the same way about the choices, listed here in alphabetical order, along with the star ratings we assigned in our reviews. They run the gamut of prices and sizes and seating arrangements. One has freshly ironed table linens. Another has upturned paint buckets on the floor. We’ll tell you all about it. Just pull up a chair or three.PETE WELLS Not yet reviewed The first foray into Manhattan for Andrew Tarlow, a restaurateur best known for his roster of uber-cool Brooklyn places (Diner, Marlow & Sons, Roman’s), Borgo seems like a leap from his signature bare-brick rusticity. But its posh elegance has sacrificed none of the accessible soulfulness of those beloved establishments. The stiff white cloths on Borgo’s tables are softened by flickering candlelight in a room that feels both grown-up and buzzy. And the trattoria-style menu includes the kinds of certified crowd-pleasers Mr. Tarlow’s restaurants do best, like an irresistible disk of cheese-topped focaccia, savory fried delicata squash rings and a bronze-skinned roast chicken with Marsala — along with earthier, more complex fare, such as plump sweetbreads, and a leg of lamb with puntarelle and prunes. Pair these with a bottle from Lee Campbell’s thoughtful, natural-leaning wine list, and raise a toast to Mr. Tarlow’s nimble hop across the East River.MELISSA CLARK 124 East 27th Street (Lexington Avenue), Midtown South; 646-360-2404;borgonyc.com We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Striking doctors. A $2,200 Dior bag. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, may have sealed his political fate on Dec. 3, when he declared martial law, triggeringpublic outrage. And on Saturday, the National Assembly voted to impeach Mr. Yoon, who was then suspended from office. But even before Mr. Yoon's brief imposition of military rule, voters were furious with a series of scandals and unpopular decisions since he took office. Amid growing inequality, rising prices and escalating threats from North Korea, his controversial leadership had left him with some of the lowest approval ratings in South Korea's history.

Within days, he announced a controversial plan to relocate the Defense Ministry so his office could move into its compound, at a cost to taxpayers of about $41 million. May Weeks into Mr. Yoon’s term, two of his cabinet nominees withdrew after being accused of nepotism. Three more would resign within months. September A media outlet published a recording of Mr. Yoon apparently using an expletive to refer to U.S. lawmakers after a meeting with President Biden. Mr. Yoon called the report “fake news,” and members of his party tried to enter the broadcaster’s offices.

The Taliban war hero scans the crowd, searching. From the back, he snatches a man with a flop of dusty hair and a face marred by shrapnel. The man’s head is bowed, and he is missing an arm and an eye. Something has happened to him, something awful. “This,” the Taliban commander says, shaking the man a bit too hard, “was the last ally of the Americans here.” In this remote province, the commander carried out one of the deadliest attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan, a pitched battle that sounded an early warning of a conflict terribly off course and altered the history of the war. Now, years after the Americans abandoned this valley, and Afghanistan altogether, the commander jerks the man from the crowd to explain how the United States lost both. Clutching the empty arm of his jacket, the commander spins him around like a marionette. The man’s sheared limb and ragged scars tell only half the story: His family was killed next to him, massacred as they fled the Taliban. 50 miles HINDU KUSH Mountains Nuristan Waygal waygal valley Want AH76 Kabul AFGHANISTAN PAKISTAN TURKMEN.

Pero para el presidente de Rusia podría ser solo un revés temporal en su búsqueda de un premio geopolítico mayor: Ucrania. PorAnatoly Kurmanaev Reportando desde Berlín La caída del presidente de Siria, Bashar al Asad, ha humillado a su principal patrocinador, Rusia, y ha puesto de manifiesto los límites del poder militar y la influencia mundial del Kremlin. Sin embargo, para el presidente de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, la pérdida de su aliado más cercano en Medio Oriente puede ser solo un revés temporal en su búsqueda de un premio geopolítico mucho mayor: el triunfo en Ucrania. Analistas militares y políticos dijeron que ganar la guerra en Ucrania se ha convertido en un objetivo integral para Putin. Ese resultado, dijeron, justificaría para el líder ruso las tremendas pérdidashumanasyeconómicasdel conflicto, salvaguardaría la condición de Estado de Rusia y su estatura global y compensaría los fracasos estratégicos en otras partes, como en Siria. “La apuesta de Putin en la guerra de Ucrania es tan alta que una victoria allí reportaría a Rusia un pago de proporciones históricas: es todo o nada”, escribió Aleksandr Baunov, analista político del grupo de investigaciónCarnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “Si cree que el destino del mundo se está decidiendo en el Donbás, entonces el futuro de Siria también se decidirá allí”. A corto plazo, mientras Moscúmaniobra para mantenersus bases militares en Siria, Putin podría intensificar su costosa ofensiva en Ucrania pararecuperar algo de prestigio. Los comentaristas rusos que apoyan la guerra han pedido a Putin que haga precisamente eso, al tiempo que exigen condiciones de paz más duras en Ucrania para evitar el tipo de alto al fuego inconcluso que en última instancia condujo a la caída de Al Asad.

They say they aren’t going away. ByJohn Yoon Photographs and Video byChang W. Lee Reporting from Seoul Lee Suyoon, a 20-year-old student, was at home just outside of Seoul on Dec. 3, sharing late-night fried chicken dinner with her mother when her phone started buzzing. A flurry of messages from her friends alerted her that martial law had been declared in South Korea and soldiers were breaking into the National Assembly. Ms. Lee, who like others her age entered adulthood largely detached from politics, dismissed the notion that there could really be a military dictatorship, and she went to bed. Everything changed the next day. As her Yonsei University classmates talked nonstop about what had happened, they shared videos of soldiers clashing with lawmakers, and news articles aboutmilitary generals testifyingbefore Parliament. After seeing that other campuses were galvanizing protesters, she felt compelled to act. By Saturday, Ms. Lee had persuaded four friends to join her andtens of thousandsof others to demand President Yoon Suk Yeol’s removaloutside the National Assembly, while a vote on animpeachment motionwas underway inside. “The martial law declaration has forced me to realize that democracy is important,” she said after the protest, and that it is also fragile. “The laws and procedures that we have set up can be destroyed in an instant.” Lee Suyoon We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"In a Rudderless Europe, Italy Has Its Moment",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/europe-italy-meloni-stability.html,"Advertisement Supported by With Germany and France mired in crisis, the government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni looks like a haven of stability, turning the continent’s usual pattern on its head. ByEmma Bubola Reporting from Rome The European Union’s biggest economies are in turmoil. France’sgovernment felllast week. Germany is facing a snap election after afragile coalition collapsed. Financial markets are nervous and E.U. authorities are worried. Amid the chaos, an unlikely haven of relative tranquillity has emerged in a country that was long considered among Europe’s most ungovernable: Italy. The government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has proved durable and stable, and the Italian economy has shown relative resilience. Many in Italy feel that Europe’s political tables have turned. “Welcome to Italian chaos!” Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister of Italy, said in an interview. “After being mocked for years for the instability of our governments,” he added, “we exported not only Parmesan, pasta and wine but also instability and coalition problems.” It seems to be a propitious moment for Ms. Meloni, who has the political winds at her back as kindred right-wing forces gain momentum in other major countries in Europe, and now also in the United States withthe election of Donald J. Trump. At a time of uncertainty in France and Germany, her supporters hope that the combination of circumstances could bolster her position, and Italy’s, on the international stage.

His Daughter Went Missing in 1999. He Couldn’t Let It Go.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/asia/south-korea-missing-person-fliers.html,"Advertisement Supported by A father’s 25-year search for his missing daughter in South Korea made him a tragic national symbol of unwavering parental devotion. ByJohn Yoon Reporting from Seoul The blue-and-yellow banners fluttering across South Korea showed a 17-year-old girl with gentle eyes and a neat bob, her smile frozen in time. The red letters beside her portrait cried out with an urgency that never dimmed for a quarter century. “Please help me find Song Hye-hee!” After she vanished on a winter night in 1999, her father, Song Gil-yong, made looking for her his life’s work. As he traveled the country putting up banners and replacing ones that had faded in the sun and rain, his face became deeply creased and tanned. The banners, each roughly the length of a car, stretched across sidewalks as office workers hurried past. After dark, they caught the glow of streetlights and neon signs. “He was always hopeful that she was out there somewhere,” said Na Joo-bong, 67, the chairman of a national organization for missing children in South Korea and one of Mr. Song’s closest confidants. “He had one wish: to hold her hand one day.” The banners made Mr. Song a symbol of parental devotion in his country. But he paid enormous personal costs. His wife took her own life. His relationship with his eldest daughter splintered. His savings dwindled with each new banner he bought and each mile he drove in his small white truck. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

PorJohn Yoon Reportando desde Seúl Las pancartas azules y amarillas que ondeaban por toda Corea del Sur mostraban a una joven de 17 años de ojos dulces y un cuidado corte de cabello bob, con una sonrisa congelada en el tiempo. Las letras rojas junto a su retrato gritaban con una urgencia que nunca se apagó en un cuarto de siglo: “¡Por favor, ayúdenme a encontrar a Song Hye-hee!”. Tras su desaparición en una noche de invierno de 1999, su padre, Song Gil-yong, hizo de su búsqueda el trabajo de su vida. Mientras viajaba por el país colocando pancartas y sustituyendo las que se habían descolorido con el sol y la lluvia, su rostro se fue arrugando y curtiendo. Las pancartas, cada una aproximadamente del tamaño del largo de un automóvil, se extendían por las aceras mientras los trabajadores de oficinas pasaban por su lado. Al anochecer, captaban el reflejo de las farolas y los letreros de neón. “Siempre tuvo la esperanza de que estuviera allá afuera, en alguna parte”, dijo Na Joo-bong, de 67 años, presidente de una organización nacional para niños desaparecidos en Corea del Sur y uno de los confidentes más cercanos de Song. “Tenía un deseo: tomarla de la mano algún día”.

Rights Groups See a Chance to Seek Justice for Syrian Regime’s Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/syria-assad-regime-crimes.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement It seems unlikely that deposed President Bashar al-Assad, who fled to Russia, will be forced to stand trial. That is not deterring activists who have worked for years to document his government’s crimes. ByMatthew Mpoke Bigg The fall of Syria’s government has breathed new life into a long push for justice overcrimes committed by the Assad regime. Now, at last, there is a chance for human rights groups to inspect prison sites, freely interview witnesses and quickly build legal cases for prosecution. Yet there is also frustration because the ultimate goal of the effort would be to see the deposed president, Bashar al-Assad, stand trial, according to rights activists who spoke this week about their work on Syria. With Mr. al-Assad in Russia,according to officials in Moscow, that prospect appears out of reach. Activists, many of whom have devoted years to the effort, remain undeterred. “We are targeting the system,” said Fadel Abdul Ghany, director of the Syrian Network for Human Rights. “The Assad regime is not just the man himself. We need to target the security forces and the army and the tools Assad used to commit those crimes.” The war in Syria has been a watershed for human rights work, in part because of the scale of the abuses committed. In addition to the more than 200,000 civilians reported to have been killed in the war, at least 15,000 people are believed to have died from torture or to have been killed inthe regime’s prison system, and some 130,000 are still missing, according to Mr. Abdul Ghany’s group. Organizations including the Commission for International Justice and Accountability and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have worked to document abuses and crimes to lay the groundwork for future prosecutions.

ByNatasha Frost The rebels who seized control of Syriamust strike a balancebetween obtaining justice for the victims of atrocities committed under the ousted Assad regime and preventing the newly liberated country from descending into unchecked vengeance. Syria’s new leaders have promised amnesty for conscripted soldiers who served under the former president, Bashar al-Assad, but Ahmed al-Shara, the leader of the rebel force that toppled him, has stressed that those who helped al-Assad brutalize or slaughter others would be held accountable. “We call on nations to hand over to us whoever of those criminals has escaped to them to subject them to justice,” he said in a post on Telegram. In Aleppo, the many monuments of the Assad regime that once dotted the city have beentoppled, torn or burned. Excitement and frenzy were on full display in some places — yet the city was still gripped by uncertainty and grim reminders of the 13-year civil war. For more: For over a decade, tens of thousands of people in Syria were tortured and killed in al-Assad’s vast network of prisons.

ByMatina Stevis-GridneffIan AustenandVjosa Isai Matina Stevis-Gridneff and Vjosa Isai reported from Toronto, and Ian Austen reported from Ottawa. Canada is working on a broad plan, including drones and police dogs, to address concerns raised by President-elect Donald J. Trump about the shared border between the two nations, underscoring the urgency of avoidingthreatened tariffsthat would send its economy into meltdown. Mr. Trump has made it clear that he expects America’s neighbors to keep undocumented migrants and drugs from entering the United States. In a closely watched meeting between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and the leaders of the country’s provinces on Wednesday, Mr. Trudeau and senior members of his government said that they would come up with measures to fortify the border. The Canadian government will flesh out details, figure out a price tag, establish a timeline and then present the plan to the incoming Trump administration before Mr. Trump’s inauguration next month, according to two officials with knowledge of the discussions, who asked not to be identified describing internal deliberations. Details of the costs of these measures will be shared on Monday, when the country’s finance minister announces an interim budget, the officials said. The measures under consideration include better controlling border crossings by deploying drones and canine units and reducing unnecessary foot traffic between the two countries, according to the two officials, who listened in on the virtual government meeting.

Live Updates: Syria’s New Leader Calls on Countries to Drop Terror Designation,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/16/world/syria-assad-rebels-news?source=nyt_sports,"Syria’sCivil War Damascus, SyriaDec. 16, 7:40 p.m. Bashar al-Assad purportedly issued an account of his flight to Russia in a statement posted to social media. The rebel alliance that drove him from power was trying to build international recognition. Vivian YeeandMatthew Mpoke Bigg Maneuvering for the future of Syria intensified on Monday after its new leaders met with foreign diplomats, and its ousted former president, Bashar al-Assad, said in what appeared to be his first public remarks since fleeing the country that he had wanted to stay and fight. In thestatement, issued Monday on social media accounts he used while in office, Mr. al-Assad said he had been evacuated to Russia after rebel forces infiltrated Damascus, the capital, just over a week ago. He also criticized the rebel alliance that has formed the country’s new leadership, as the Kremlin acknowledged that the fate of the critical Russian bases in Syria was uncertain. Tass, the Russian state news agency, also reported Mr. al-Assad’s statement, which said it had been issued from Moscow. The statement later appeared to have been removed from one of the social media accounts of the former Syrian presidency. Here’s what else to know: Assad statement:Mr. al-Assadsaid in the statementthat he did not “consider stepping down or seeking refuge” as the rebels advanced, and that he had remained in Damascus, until Dec. 8, when, he said, fighters moved in. Coordinating with “our Russian allies,” Mr. al-Assad said he then headed to the coastal city of Latakia, near where Russia operates a military base. Syria diplomacy:As the world reckons with the rise to power of a conservative Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, long designated a terrorist organization, the group’s leader, Ahmed al-Shara,met on Sundaywith the U.N. special envoy to Syria, Geir O. Pedersen. The new government was also expected to meet with leaders from across Europe and the Middle East. Many international powers have said they want to see a stable, unified Syria with an inclusive government that respects the rights of Syria’s minorities, and they now have the leverage to coax the new leadership toward that notion. Israeli strikes:Israel carried out another heavy wave of airstrikes overnight on Syria’s coastal region, a war monitorsaidon Monday, as the Israeli military continued to pound Syria in a bid to destroy the country’s military assets after the rebel alliance seized power. Israel has said it aims to keep military equipment away from extremists. Netanyahu and Trump:Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a statement on Sunday that he had shared a “very friendly, warm and important”telephone conversationover the weekend with President-elect Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump did not immediately comment on the call.  Alex Pena and Neil Collier As speculation mounts over Russia’s future in Syria, we observed a convoy of Russian military vehicles — including armored personnel carriers, supply trucks and mobile surface-to-air systems — traveling northbound between Tartus and Latakia on Monday. Russian military activity hasincreasedin western Syria in the past few days. The region is home to several key sites used by Russia's military, including a naval base in Tartus and an airbase near Latakia. Euan Ward The Kurdish-led administration in northeast Syria called on Monday for unity with the new authorities in Damascus and an end to all military operations inside the country. Amid an offensive by Turkish-backed fighters, there are fears among Syria’s Kurds that Assad’s downfall could unravel hard-fought gains made during the civil war, including limited autonomy. Advertisement Matthew Mpoke Bigg In the statementreleased on Monday, al-Assad at times appeared to refer to himself in the third person as he defends his record during the country’s brutal civil war and the last days of his presidency. He lamented that Syria had fallen into the “hands of terrorism,” but said his bond with the Syrian people remained “unshaken.” Anton Troianovski Syria went unmentioned in an hourlong televised meeting that President Vladimir V. Putin held with the Russian military’s top brass on Monday. Putin has yet to comment on Syria since his ally Bashar al-Assad’s fall, and his continued silence is a sign that the Kremlin is still struggling to determine what its future military presence in Syria will be. Anton Troianovski Earlier Monday, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said there had been “no final decisions” on the future of Russia’s two military bases in Syria. He added that Russia was “in contact” with the new Syrian authorities. Matthew Mpoke Bigg Syria’s former leader, Bashar al-Assad, said he was evacuated from Syria by Russian forces after a rebel alliance seized the capital but had wanted to stay and fight, according to a statement that was posted on Monday to social media accounts he used while in office and reported by Russian state news media. The statement, which said it had been issued from Moscow, contained what appeared to be the first public comments from Mr. al-Assad since his government was overthrown just over a week ago. In it, he defended his record during the country’s long and brutal civil war, criticized the country’s new leadership and gave details of his flight from Syria. The Russian state news agency, Tass, reported news of the statement on its website on Monday. Mr. al-Assad said that he had not planned to leave the country, and said he did not “consider stepping down or seeking refuge” as the rebels advanced. He said he had remained in Damascus, the capital, “carrying out my duties” until early on Dec. 8, when, he said, rebels began to infiltrate the city. At that point, he moved “in coordination with our Russian allies” to the Syrian coastal city of Latakia, and later arrived at Russia’s Hmeimim air base nearby, he said. “As the field situation in the area continued to deteriorate, the Russian military base itself came under intensified attack by drone strikes. With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base’s command arrange an immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday Dec. 8,” Mr. al-Assad said in the statement, which was published in English. This account of the episode could not be independently confirmed. The Kremlin has said that Mr. al-Assad made the “personal decision” to leave office and that President Vladimir V. Putin had offered exile to him and his family. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, has saidMoscow will not disclose detailsof Mr. al-Assad’s location in Russia, which has been a staunch ally of Mr. al-Assad. The Assad family ruled Syria with unrelenting force for more than 60 years. Since the rebel coalitionoverthrew Mr. al-Assad’s governmentover a week ago, Syrians have begun to reckon with thenetwork of prisons, police stations and torture chambers that were central to his family’s brutal rule, and the abuses of the past 13 years, after the failed rebel uprising and subsequent civil war.Death tollestimates from the conflict are as high as 620,000, in a country with a prewar population of 22 million. Mr. al-Assad’s arrival in Russia has effectively put him out of the reach ofinternational justice, human rights advocates have said. In the statement, Mr. Assad offered a defense of his record in office, saying he had “refused to barter the salvation of his nation for personal gain.” Mr. al-Assad, who at times in the one-page statement referred to himself in the third person, also did not mention any plans for his future, and said that his bond with Syria and its people remained “unshaken.” “When the state falls into the hands of terrorism and the ability to make a meaningful contribution is lost any position becomes void of purpose,” he said, in an apparent attempt to provide a larger explanation for his departure. There was no immediate public response to the statement from Syria’s new transitional government. Advertisement Vivian Yee Reporting from Cairo A little more than a week after overthrowing the longtime Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, the rebel alliance that took power in Syria was making rapid progress toward international recognition of its legitimacy as its officials began to receive diplomats from the United Nations, the Middle East and Europe. The leader of therebel coalition, Ahmed al-Shara, met on Sunday with the United Nations special envoy to Syria, Geir O. Pedersen, and they discussed the unfolding political transition, according to a message on Telegram posted by the coalition. Mr. al-Shara, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, “stressed the importance of rapid and effective cooperation” to rebuild Syria, develop its economy and maintain Syria as a unified territory, the Telegram post said. Speaking to reporters on his arrival in the Syrian capital, Damascus, Mr. Pedersensaidmany challenges lay ahead for Syria and called for increased aid to assist with the country’s humanitarian crisis. Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign policy chief,told reporterson Monday that she had sent the “European top diplomat in Syria” to meet with the new government in Damascus. The European Union is the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to Syria through U.N. agencies, making the relationship with Brussels a crucial one. France’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that a team of diplomats would travel to Syria on Tuesday. And Turkey and Qatar, which were in contact with the rebels well before the surprise offensive that rocketed them from obscurity in Syria’s northwest to control of nearly the entire country, were both reopening their embassies in Damascus. Since Mr. al-Assad fled the advancing rebels on Dec. 8, the rest of the world has had to reckon with a sudden new reality in Syria: A country where nearly 14 years of civil war had left Mr. al-Assad in seemingly firm control was now in the hands of a conservative Islamist group,Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, that the United Nations, the United States, Turkey and many other countries had long designated as a terrorist organization for its early ties to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Arab countries had for years been moving towardnormalizing relationswith Mr. al-Assad, despite his brutal treatment of his people, and Western countries, while hitting him with heavy sanctions, had grudgingly come to accept that he was there to stay. His overthrow scrambled that calculus, forcing foreign powers to decide how to deal with a largely unknown quantity that many of them had shunned as extremists for years. Many of those powers, including the United States, European countries and Turkey, say they want to see a stable, unified Syria with an inclusive government that respects the rights of Syria’s minorities, including Shiite Muslims, Druse, Christians of various sects and Alawites, the Shiite offshoot sect that the Assad family and many of its strongest supporters belongs to. Foreign countries have the leverage to push Syria’s new leadership toward that vision. To unlock greater flows of humanitarian aid, get suffocating economic sanctions lifted and earn international legitimacy — all required for a crippled, impoverished Syria to stabilize and rebuild — Hayat Tahrir al-Sham will need other countries to remove its designation as a terrorist group. Ms. Kallas hassaidthat the European Union will not lift sanctions on Syria until its new leadership shows it will protect minorities and women’s rights and disavow extremism. On Monday, she told reporters that European foreign ministers meeting in Brussels would discuss “how we engage with the new leadership of Syria and on what level we engage the leadership and, of course, what more steps are we willing to take if we see that Syria goes to the right direction.” Individual European countries were also gradually reaching out to Damascus. Italy, which has maintained a diplomatic presence in the Syrian capital since 2018, was the first to engage on the ground. Its ambassador was the only European representative in a meeting the Syrian transitional administration held last week with several Arab ambassadors, according to Italy’s foreign ministry. Jean-Noël Barrot, France’s foreign minister,told France Inter radioon Sunday that a team of four French diplomats would head to Syria on Tuesday for the first time since 2012, when France and many other countries broke with Mr. al-Assad over the bloody crackdown on peaceful antigovernment protesters that instigated the civil war. Mr. Barrot said the main goals were to establish first contact with the Syrian authorities there and to evaluate the needs of the Syrian population. “But also to verify whether or not the initial statements made by this new authority — which were rather encouraging, which called for calm, which apparently did not commit any abuses — are actually being followed up on the ground,” Mr. Barrot added. The quickening diplomatic engagement reflected the winners and losers in the new Syria. Russia, a key ally of Mr. al-Assad, said over the weekend that it had evacuated some staff members from its embassy in Damascus, though the embassy confirmed that its ambassador was staying. But Turkey, which has long hadtacit linksto Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and has emerged as an important go-between for the group and other foreign governments, raised its flag over its embassy in Damascus on Saturday for the first time in 12 years. And Qatar, which like Turkey has maintained a relationship with the group and supports Islamist groups around the Middle East, likewise sent a diplomatic delegation to Syria to reopen its embassy there, its foreign ministry said in aposton X on Sunday evening. Mr. al-Shara, who has long craved international legitimacy for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, appears attuned to concerns about whether his group is ready to lead. According to the Telegram post announcing his meeting with Mr. Pedersen, he said it would be important to secure economic and political support for creating a safe environment for the millions of Syrian refugees in the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere to return. “Leader al-Shara pointed out the need to implement these steps with great care and high precision without haste and under the supervision of specialized teams, so that they are achieved in the best possible way,” it said.

Euan Ward Israel carried out a heavy wave of airstrikes overnight on Syria’s coastal region, a war monitor said early on Monday, as the Israeli military continued to pound Syria in a bid to destroy the country’s military assets after rebels seized power. The overnight strikestargetedformer Syrian Army positions including air defense sites and missile warehouses, according to the war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organization based in Britain that has long tracked the conflict in Syria. Earlier in the day, an Israeli airstrike also targeted radars in Deir al-Zour’s military airport in the country’s east, the Observatorysaid. The “successive strikes” along the Syrian coast —home to Russian naval bases— amounted to “the most violent strikes in the area” since 2012, according to the Observatory. It said there were 18 airstrikes, which were particularly powerful because they were consecutive and detonated missiles in warehouses, leading to secondary explosions. The Israeli military declined to comment on the strikes. Israeli officials have previously said that the campaign in Syria is an effort to keep military equipment out of the hands of “extremists,” after an alliance of rebel groups ousted the Assad regime earlier this month. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the latest strikes, the Observatory said. Israel has struck Syria more than 450 times since the collapse of the Assad government, according to the Observatory,destroying Syria’s navyand dozens of air bases, ammunition depots and other military equipment. Israel’s militaryhas also seizedand occupied an expanse of territory in Syria over the de facto border between the two countries, including on the Syrian side of the strategic Mt. Hermon. Israel has given no timeline for its departure, apart from saying thatit would stayuntil its security demands were met. On Sunday, the Israeli government unanimously approved plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to expand settlements in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, part of an $11 million scheme to double the population in the area. The move was necessary, the prime minister’s office said, because a “new front” had opened up on Israel’s border with Syria after the fall of the Assad government. Israel seized the Golan Heights during the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and it is considered illegally occupied under international law. The head of the group leading the rebel coalition that now governs Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, said in an interview on Saturday with Syria TV, a pro-opposition channel, that Israel was using pretexts to justify “unwarranted” territorial seizures in Syria. Still, he said, Syria could not afford any further conflict and was instead focused on diplomatic solutions. “Syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations,” Mr. al-Shara said. “The priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not being drawn into disputes that could lead to further destruction.” Gabby SobelmanandVivian Yeecontributed reporting.

But the peril is not over for Syria’s Kurdish minority. A number ofarmed factions are still jostling for controlafter the collapse of the Assad regime. They include the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which have allied with the United States to combat the extremist Islamic State, and the Syrian National Army, a militia backed by Turkey, which is hostile to the Kurdish forces. For more than a decade, the Kurdish-led soldiers have been America’s most reliablepartner in Syria, liberating cities seized by the extremist group and detaining around 9,000 of its fighters. But Turkey, which shares a border with Syria, has long considered the Kurdish group to be its enemy. The Turkish government believes the Kurdish fighters in Syria are allied with the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., which has fought the Turkish state for decades. PresidentRecep Tayyip Erdoganof Turkey, who backs the rebel groups that toppled the Assad regime, appears eager to seize the opportunity created by the momentous political shift in Syria to pursue his own agenda against the Kurdish fighters. The shape of the new Syrian government, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is still being determined. But American officials and Middle East analysts agree:Turkey will have an outsized influence. That means Kurdish groups’ foothold in the northeast looks increasingly “tenuous,” said Wa’el Alzayat, a Syria expert and former American diplomat. Turkey “will have the biggest leverage in what’s happening, and will happen, in Syria for the foreseeable future,” he said. As Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its allies seized control from President Bashar al-Assad, “they brought with them a tide of Turkish power and influence over the future of Syria,” said Nicholas Heras, a senior analyst at the New Lines Institute. The high stakes for the Kurds, and for Western forces determined to prevent a renewed ISIS threat, were illuminated earlier this past week. Even as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its allies took over,Turkish-backed rebels attacked the Syrian Democratic Forces, supported by Turkish airstrikes and artillery fire. The commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Gen.Mazloum Abdi, told The New York Timeshe had to divert fighters who were defending the prisons that house accused ISIS members to fight off the Turkish-backed militants. Now, Mr. Heras predicted, Arabs who had joined the Syrian Democratic Forces to fight the Islamic State could disband or defect to other rebel groups, under pressure from Turkey and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. That would further weaken the Kurdish forces. A best-case scenario for the Kurds, officials and experts said, might see them receive enough support from the United States to secure the territory they hold in northeast Syria. That could give them leverage with the new government in Damascus to pursue a fully autonomous state, something minority Kurds in Syria have long sought. At worst, the Kurds could face an inflamed conflict with Turkish-backed fighters, be forced to cede control of at least some of their oil-rich territory and, if President-elect Donald J. Trump decides to withdraw U.S. troops, lose vital help on the ground. “There really needs to be some kind of cease-fire/peace agreement between the Turks and the Kurds that both sides can agree with,” said Natasha Hall, a Syria expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The Biden administration is racing to negotiate just that before it leaves office next month. Following meetings in Turkey last week, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Saturday that “making sure that ISIS was in a box” remained an urgent priority in Syria. He said the Kurdish fighters were “playing a critical role in pursuing that mission.” But the diplomatic balancing act he faced was clear: His meetings in Turkey included talks with the foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, who earlier last week said that “any P.K.K. extension in Syria cannot be considered a legitimate partner.” And on Friday, Mr. Fidan pointedly cited the P.K.K. as he described efforts to keep terrorist organizations from exploiting the political chaos in Syria. Yet there are signs that American diplomacy is having an impact. Last week, an American commander, Gen. Michael E. Kurilla,visited northeast Syria, where 900 American troops are stationed. Hours later, a cease-fire between the Kurdish forces and a Turkish-backed rebel group known as the Syrian National Army was announced in the northern city of Manbij, where the two sides have frequently clashed. General Abdi, the Kurdish commander,said on Xthat the cease-fire was brokered with American help. Under the agreement, he said, Kurdish forces would withdraw from Manbij, a majority Arab city which they seized from the Islamic State in 2016 but that hassince become a flashpointamong battling factions for control. But he and other Syrian ethnic Kurds are increasingly worried that their retreat from Manbij is just the beginning. Last Tuesday, a senior Hayat Tahrir al-Sham officer said thatlocal tribes allied with his grouphad wrested control of the eastern city of Deir al-Zour from Kurdish fighters who had taken over asMr. al-Assad’s forces collapsedjust days earlier. And in the days since, the Turkish-backed rebels have repeatedly battled with Kurdish forces in the region around the Euphrates River. Mr. Heras, the New Lines analyst, said he thought those skirmishes could be military preparations for an invasion of Kobani, a majority Kurdish city. The city, just south of the Turkish border, holds deep emotional significance for the Kurdish forces, who fought with American troops toreclaim itafter a four-month Islamic State siege that began in late 2015. General Abdi now appears to bebracing for a possible invasionby Turkey’s allied fighters. Mr. Heras said residents were fleeing Kobani by the thousands despite a shaky truce agreement this past week that aimed to buy time for negotiations. “Turkey is taking advantage of the crisis in Syria to destabilize the region and seize our land, while claiming they are fighting terrorists,” said Sinam Sherkany Mohamad, the head of the Kurdish fighters’ political wing in Washington, in a statement. “But we are not terrorists, we are democratic U.S. allies.” James F. Jeffrey, a former American ambassador to Turkey who was a chief Syria envoy during Mr. Trump’s first administration, said any invasion of Kobani would violate a 2019 agreement that the U.S. negotiated for a détente, “and whether by the Turks, or Syrian forces associated with the Turks, it makes no difference.” In the meantime, General Abdi has sought to shore up the Kurdish fighters’ relationship with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, sayinghe is seeking direct relationswith the group’s leaders. Officials and experts said Turkey may wait until its interests are locked in with the new Syrian government before deciding whether to launch a full-bore military offensive against the Kurdish forces. It may also watch to see whether Mr. Trump withdraws American troops, and how his administration deals with Mr. Erdogan, a like-minded strongman whose relationship with the United States hasoften been tempestuous. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, warned in astatementon social media that he was prepared to push for economic sanctions against Turkey if it attacked the Kurdish forces, which he said would “set in motion an ISIS jailbreak.” He added: “If Turkey takes military action against Kurdish forces in Syria, it will jeopardize America’s interests dramatically.” Safak Timurcontributed reporting from Istanbul.

German Government Collapses at a Perilous Time for Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/europe/germany-confidence-vote-scholz-snap-election.html,"Advertisement Supported by Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote, deepening the political turbulence in one of the continent’s most powerful economies. ByChristopher F. SchuetzeandJim Tankersley Christopher F. Schuetze reported from Berlin, and Jim Tankersley from Washington. The German government collapsed on Monday as Chancellor Olaf Scholz losta confidence votein Parliament, deepeninga crisis of leadership across Europeat a time of mounting economic and security challenges. The war in Ukraine has escalated. President-elect Donald J. Trump is set to take office in the United States, raising new questions over Europeans’ trade relations and military defense. AndFrance’s government fellthis month. Now, Europe’s largest economy is in the hands of a caretaker government, ahead of elections early next year. German lawmakers voted to dissolve the existing government by a vote of 394 to 207, with 116 abstaining. The collapse of the government, just nine months before parliamentary elections had been scheduled, was an extraordinary moment for Germany. The elections, now expected on Feb. 23, will be only the fourth snap election in the 75 years since the modern state was founded, reflecting a new era of more fractious and unstable politics in a country long known for durable coalitions built on plodding consensus. Mr. Scholz had little choice but to take the unusual step of calling for the confidence vote after histhree-party coalitionsplintered in November, ending months of bitter internal squabbling and leaving him without a parliamentary majority to pass laws or a budget.

Hundreds Feared Dead After Cyclone Hits French Territory of Mayotte,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/africa/mayotte-cyclone-chido-deaths.html,"Advertisement Supported by Officials on the archipelago off the eastern coast of Africa said the number of people killed by Tropical Cyclone Chido could be much higher than the 14 now confirmed dead. ByAurelien BreedenAmelia NierenbergandIsabella Kwai Emergency workers and families on Monday desperately searched for victims after astorm devastatedthe French territory of Mayotte, off the eastern coast of Africa. Officials fear that hundreds or even thousands could be dead, far higher than the current confirmed toll of 14. Tropical Storm Chido, which hit over the weekend, destroyed homes, schools and businesses on the tiny archipelago, with wind gusts of up to 124 miles per hour. Forecasters said that it was the worst storm in 90 years to hit the territory. Mohamed Abdallah, the father of a family of seven, said that they had “lost everything.” As he picked up pieces of iron on the streets to rebuild a shelter on Monday, he said, “It will take us a while to even be safe.” France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, led an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday evening to coordinate the government’s response. France has startedaid flightsfrom Réunion, another French territory in the region. “I think that there will be several hundred” deaths, François-Xavier Bieuville, France’s top-ranking representative on Mayotte,tolda local news channel. “Maybe we will be closer to a thousand, maybe several thousand.” The interior ministry cautioned that officials would likely be unable to count all the victims. About a third of the territory’s 320,000 people are undocumented immigrants, the ministry said, which could complicate official tallies.

Why America’s Kurdish Allies Are Under Threat in a New Syria,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/middleeast/kurdish-forces-syria-turkey-isis-america.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Supported by The Kurds helped the United States contain the Islamic State. Now they fear a resurgent Turkey that has long considered them an adversary. Here’s a guide. ByLara Jakes Lara Jakes writes about global conflicts and diplomacy. The 13-year civil war between Syria’s government and rebel fighters has ended. But the peril is not over for Syria’s Kurdish minority. A number ofarmed factions are still jostling for controlafter the collapse of the Assad regime. They include the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which have allied with the United States to combat the extremist Islamic State, and the Syrian National Army, a militia backed by Turkey, which is hostile to the Kurdish forces. For more than a decade, the Kurdish-led soldiers have been America’s most reliablepartner in Syria, liberating cities seized by the extremist group and detaining around 9,000 of its fighters. But Turkey, which shares a border with Syria, has long considered the Kurdish group to be its enemy. The Turkish government believes the Kurdish fighters in Syria are allied with the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., which has fought the Turkish state for decades. PresidentRecep Tayyip Erdoganof Turkey, who backs the rebel groups that toppled the Assad regime, appears eager to seize the opportunity created by the momentous political shift in Syria to pursue his own agenda against the Kurdish fighters.

Myanmar’s War Has Forced Doctors and Nurses Into Prostitution,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/asia/myanmar-war-women-prostitution.html,"Advertisement Supported by Nearly four years into a grinding civil conflict, the economy is in ruins, and people — even professionals with degrees — are desperate. BySui-Lee Wee After seven years of medical school in Myanmar, May finally achieved her goal of becoming a doctor. But a month after she graduated and found a job, her dreams started unraveling. In February 2021, Myanmar’s military seized power in a coup, and the country’s economy, already hammered by the pandemic, started to buckle. Prices soared and May’s paycheck, the equivalent of $415 a month, evaporated even faster. With her father suffering from kidney disease, she grew more and more desperate. Then she met “date girls,” who were making twice as much as her. The money was enticing — even if it involved sex with men. “It’s difficult to accept that, despite all my years of study to become a doctor, I’m now doing this kind of work just to make ends meet,” said May, 26, who has been working as a prostitute for over a year in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city. She, like others who spoke for this article, asked not to be identified by her full name because her family does not know how she earns money and prostitution is illegal in Myanmar. Thecoup and ensuing civil warhaveravaged Myanmar’s economy. Inflation soared to 26 percent this year as power shortages crippled factories, unseasonal rain flooded farms and fighting in areas near China and Thailand decimated cross-border trade. The currency, the kyat, has lost two-fifths of its value against the dollar this year. Nearly half of Myanmar’s people now live in poverty, according to the World Bank. This calamity has forced a new cadre of women in Myanmar into sex work: doctors, teachers, nurses and other educated professionals. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Resigns, in Blow to Trudeau’s Hold on Power",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/canada/chrystia-freeland-resigns-canada-finance-minister.html,"Advertisement Supported by The departure of Chrystia Freeland, who had been helping lead Canada’s response to the incoming Trump administration, threatens Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s hold on power. ByMatina Stevis-GridneffandIan Austen Matina Stevis-Gridneff reported from Toronto, and Ian Austen from Ottawa Chrystia Freeland, the deputy prime minister who led Canada’s response to the first Trump administration, resigned abruptly on Monday from the cabinet in a stinging rebuke to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, marking the first open dissent from any cabinet member and raising questions about his hold on power. The revelation, in a letter of resignation, came hours before Ms. Freeland, who had been the finance minister, was scheduled to outline the government’s commitments to improve border security with the United States as part of an interim budget. Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet, which was meeting in Ottawa soon after the letter was made public, seemed stunned by the development. “Chrystia Freeland is a good friend, someone I work with very, very closely,” Anita Anand, the transport minister told reporters in Ottawa. “This news has hit me really hard.” Mr. Trudeau’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comments. On Monday, another senior cabinet member and rising star within Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal Party, Sean Fraser, the housing minister, announced he would resign, compounding the sense that the prime minister’s lieutenants were abandoning him. Ms. Freeland’s high-profile departure comes at a treacherous moment for Canada: President-elect Donald J. Trump has warned that he will impose 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries do more to curb the flow of undocumented migrants and drugs into the United States.

"Ex-Bangladeshi Leader Orchestrated Mass Disappearances, Inquiry Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/asia/bangladesh-disappearances-sheikh-hasina.html,"Advertisement Supported by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and top officials are implicated in a centralized program that abducted dissidents and held them in secret prisons, an official commission’s preliminary report said. BySaif HasnatandMujib Mashal Saif Hasnat reported from Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Mujib Mashal from New Delhi. Bangladesh’s ousted prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and senior officials orchestrated a centralized program of enforced disappearances with thousands of likely victims, a commission set up by the country’s interim government said in a preliminary report. The full extent of the practice during Ms. Hasina’s 15-year rule started becoming apparent after she was toppled this summer and fled to India amid widespread protests against her increasing authoritarian turn. In the chaotic vacuum after her fall, families of the disappeared camped outside government offices and military barracks seeking news of their loved ones. Victims who had spent years in underground cells without seeing daylight came out to share their stories, including indetailed accounts in The New York Times. Members of the commission, led by a retired judge, Mainul Islam Chowdhury, said they had received more than 1,600 reports of enforced disappearances since they began their work in late August, but they estimated the actual number of victims, mostly political opponents and dissenting voices, at two or three times that. The report said that the practice had a “central command structure” and “was systematically designed over 15 years to remain undetectable.” It operated in a top-down manner, implicating Ms. Hasina and her closest lieutenants, most of whom have fled the country. The commission identified at least eight secret facilities where detainees had been held, and relays accounts of what it described as institutionalized torture.

Five ‘Bali Nine’ Drug Smugglers Return to Australia After Two Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/australia/bali-nine-ring-indonesia-return.html,"Advertisement Supported by The men were the last Australians still imprisoned in Indonesia for trying to smuggle heroin in 2005, in a case that became a diplomatic flashpoint between the countries. ByVictoria Kim Reporting from Sydney, Australia The last five members of the so-called Bali Nine, a group of Australians who were convicted of smuggling heroin nearly two decades ago, have been released from prison in Indonesia and are back in Australia, according to the authorities in both countries. The men’s repatriation ends a long saga that captivated the Australian public, involving young people who in 2005 tried to board a flight in Bali, the Indonesian island that is a popular tourist destination, with heroin strapped to their bodies. The case was a diplomatic sore spot between the nations for years. The five men, Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen and Michael Czugaj, arrived in Australia on Sunday afternoon, officials said. Of their four co-defendants, two, who were considered ringleaders, wereexecuted by firing squadin 2015. Another died in prison, of cancer, in 2018, and one was released due to good behavior in 2018. Australia‘s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, called the five men’s return an “act of compassion” on the part of Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto. Mr. Prabowo, afeared former generalwho was once barred from entering the United States because of his human rights record, was elected president this year and has been trying to recast himself as adiplomatically savvy statesman. Yusril Ihza Mahendra, an Indonesian minister who oversees law and penitentiary affairs, said the men had not been granted pardons and were being transferred as prisoners,according to Antara, a government-run news agency. Mr. Mahendra said their repatriation was based on reciprocity and that Australia would give similar considerations in return, the agency reported. Mr. Albanese said in a statement that the men “will now have the opportunity to continue their personal rehabilitation and reintegration here in Australia.” The government gave few details about their arrival, but Australian news outlets reported that because the countries have no prisoner transfer agreement, the men will be free to live their lives.

Letby’s Lawyers Seek Appeal After Lead Expert ‘Changed Mind’ on Murders,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/europe/letby-murders-appeal.html,"LucyLetby Case Advertisement Supported by Lawyers for Lucy Letby, a British nurse found guilty of murdering seven babies, said that the prosecution’s expert witness was not reliable after he changed his mind about why three infants died. ByMegan Specia Reporting from London The defense team forLucy Letby, a British nurse found guilty of murdering babies in her care, said on Monday that it will ask the Court of Appeal to review all of her convictions, because the lead prosecution expert has changed his mind about how three of the babies died. The development shines a critical spotlight onto Ms. Letby’s convictions for the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of seven others at a hospital in northern England between 2015 and 2016. The case shocked Britain but has increasingly been viewed by some experts as a possible miscarriage of justice. Dr. Dewi Evans, a retired pediatrician, was the prosecution’s lead expert witness and had testified in court that air had been injected down the nasal gastric tube of three babies in Ms. Letby’s care, leading to their deaths. “Remarkably, Dr. Evans has now changed his mind on the cause of death of three of the babies,” Mark McDonald, a defense attorney for Ms. Letby said during a news briefing in London on Monday. “I have never known in 26 years of being a barrister an expert to change their mind a year after the convictions on the cause of death in what they said to the jury,” Mr. McDonald later added. “That is astonishing.” He said that Dr. Evans had given a new report to the police a few months ago, in which he said that he had revised his opinion on the death of one of the babies, known as Baby C. Dr. Evans has also given public statements since the trial, in which he offered differing accounts of the deaths of two other babies. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

​Impeachment in South Korea Has Cost Washington a Staunch Ally,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/asia/south-korea-us-diplomacy.html,"SouthKorea Turmoil Advertisement Supported by President Yoon Suk Yeol shifted his country closer to Washington and stood up to Beijing. But that foreign policy could be recalibrated in the future. ByChoe Sang-Hun Reporting from Seoul President Yoon Suk Yeol has changed the course of South Korea’s diplomacy like no leader before him. He put his country in lock step with the United States by countering North Korea with sanctions and joint military drills. He wonWashington’s plauditswhen he overcame acentury of historical grievancesKoreans held against Japan​ and helped lay the ground fortrilateral cooperationto deter China. He sang the praises of Western values such as freedom. He credited the alliance with ​Washington for making South Korea’s ​ascent as a global economic and cultural powerhouse possible. He moved South Korea ​more assertively onto the global stage, criticizing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “a violation of international law” and sellingweapons​ andammunitionto countries that supported Ukraine. And he stood up against China, ​which South Korea ​had long feared as a bully but needs as a trading partner, by opposing its “unlawful maritime claims” in the Indo-Pacific region. Now​, as he is locked out of power followinghis impeachment,his foreign policy — and ​Washington’s painstaking alliance-building in Northeast Asia —​ faces the prospect of unraveling. Mr. Yoon was not impeached for his foreign policy. But his diplomatic agenda​ — his greatest legacy​ — could be one of the biggest casualties of his downfall. Mr. Yoon is suspended from office, and the Constitutional Court began preliminary deliberations on Monday as to whether to reinstate him or formally remove him. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo,a nonelected officialwith no popular mandate, has stepped in as an interim leader as stipulated by the Constitution. “Washington couldn’t have asked for a better ally and partner than the Yoon government,” said Duyeon Kim, a fellow with the Center for a New American Security. “Until we know who South Korea’s president is, the U.S. just lost a key partner at the leader level whose personal conviction aligns with Washington’s values and approach to regional and global issues, particularly when dealing with authoritarian states.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"As Ambassador, Rahm Emanuel Says His Impatience Nudged Japan Forward",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/asia/rahm-emanuel-ambassador-japan.html,"Advertisement Supported by In a society used to quiet consensus-building, Tokyo has made bold changes to its defense policy. “Did I contribute to that?” Mr. Emanuel asked. “Uh, yeah.” ByMotoko Rich Reporting from Tokyo Patience, Rahm Emanuel likes to say, is a waste of time. The former congressman, chief of staff to President Barack Obama and mayor of Chicago is brash, a touch cocky and frequently profane. Above all, he wants to get things done. Yesterday. As the United States ambassador to Japan, a country where change typically follows a long process of quiet consensus-building referred to as “nemawashi,” Mr. Emanuel, 65, was initially seen as an unorthodox appointment. But maybe, he suggests, he was just what Japan needed. “I think on a lot of things, Japan was ready to go,” said Mr. Emanuel, referring to a recent cascade of bold revisions to the country’s defense policy. In the past three years, Japan hasdoubled the amountearmarked for military spending,acquired Tomahawk missilesfrom the United States and, in a reversal of postwar restrictions on weapons exports, agreed tomanufacture American-designed Patriot missilesto sell to the U.S. government. Although he acknowledged the groundwork was laid before he arrived, Mr. Emanuel said these changes didn’t simply coincide with his term as American envoy to Tokyo. “While I was here, they did more, went faster and farther and deeper than I think they themselves originally thought,” he said during an interview late last month in the library of his residence in Tokyo. “Did I contribute to that?” Mr. Emanuel said. “Uh, yeah.” Just how much credit should go to Mr. Emanuel is a matter of perspective. “Ambassador Emanuel shared various ideas with me and offered advice,” the former prime minister,Fumio Kishida, who left office in early October, said in an interview late last month in his parliamentary office in Tokyo.

How Will the Rebels Rule Syria? Their Past Offers Clues.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/middleeast/rebels-syria-governing-style-idlib.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Supported by The Islamist rebels who ousted Syria’s dictator ran a pragmatic and disciplined administration in the territory they controlled. They also jailed their critics. ByNeil MacFarquharandJustin Scheck Every fall, when farmers across the rolling, red dirt hills of Idlib Province in northern Syria harvest their olive crops, they routinely find at least one representative of the local tax authoritystationedat any oil press. The tax collector takes at least 5 percent of the oil, and farmers grouse that there are no exceptions, even in lean harvest years. The collectors work for the civilian government established under Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel movement that just spearheaded the swift overthrow of the 54-year Assad dynasty. The Islamist group has administered much of opposition-held Idlib Province since 2017. Measures like the olive oil tax, introduced in 2019, have prompted protests and even occasional armed clashes and arrests. Yet the Syrian Salvation Government, as the Idlib administration was known, persisted. It taxed goods entering its territory and generated revenue by selling fuel and running a telecom company. It also controlled the local economy through licensing regulation programs that looked a lot like a conventional government’s and proved that it was fairly adept at managing those finances to build up its military operations and provide civil services. The portrait of the rebel group detailed in this article was gleaned from interviews with experts, representatives of humanitarian or other organizations working in the territory under its control, local residents and reports bythe United Nationsorthink tanks.

Supported by ByCarlotta Gall Photographs byDavid Guttenfelder Reporting from Tel Rifaat in northwestern Syria The skies were quiet the other night in the northwestern town of Tel Rifaat, Syria, and relief was palpable among fighters and civilians who have lived for years under the constant threat of bombardment. A man named Ali, 48, guarded the northern entrance to town, sitting in a chair on the road next to a wood stove at an old police post. He gave only his first name for security reasons. But there was no danger of attack, he said, and no bombing. As night fell in the courtyard of a primary school, Syrian rebel fighters from the town — who helped recapture it from government-allied forces less than two weeks ago — knelt for the evening Muslim prayer. They were still elated by their victory, which ended their own lives of displacement, spent in tents, and those of many families from the town, who were already coming home. “The people of Tel Rifaat really wanted to return to their town,” said Firas Alito al-Ageid, 40, commander of the rebel unit. “This was the most important thing.

ByIsabel Kershner Reporting from Jerusalem Israel announced on Sunday that it was closing its embassy in Dublin in light of what it described as “the extreme anti-Israel policies of the Irish government.” The decision came days after Ireland announced that it would file an intervention in support of South Africa’s case against Israel in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, a charge Israel vehemently rejects. Israeli officials said shuttering the embassy in Ireland did not mean that Israel was severing diplomatic relations with Ireland. Officials from both countries noted that Ireland’s embassy in Tel Aviv will continue to function. But the move indicated a more muscular diplomatic policy led by Gideon Saar, Israel’s conservative foreign minister who wasappointed to the post last month, as Israel faces mounting international criticism of the conduct of its war in the Gaza Strip. “Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel,” Mr. Saar said in a statement on Sunday, adding: “Israel will invest its resources in advancing bilateral relations with countries worldwide according to priorities that also take into account the attitudes and actions of these states toward Israel.” Illustrating his policy of rewarding countries considered friendly toward Israel, Mr. Saar also announced on Sunday that Israel would be opening a new embassy in Moldova, a country that already maintains an embassy in Israel.

While some Syrians havewandered through his luxurious palace, many more have combed through the vast network of detention centers whose repression helped keep him in power. An untold number of Syrians disappeared into the maw of that security apparatus over the decades. As the rebels broke into prisons and freed prisoners over the last few weeks, many Syrians hoped that their missing relatives would soon return home.

Every two years, the Dakar Biennale draws in wealthy collectors and stylish art aficionados, who show up at exhibitions in Senegal’s capital with sunglasses they’re too cool to take off. But this year, a new kind of art lover is making what is already Africa’s hottest art show trendier still. Increasingly, it’s Senegalese teenagers and young adults who are thronging Dakar’s Old Courthouse, the biennale’s main exhibition center. They show up with dates or with friends after classes. In flip-flops or shiny leather shoes. In a neatly ironed linen shirt or a faded soccer jersey. Wearing a flashy head scarf or tight leather pants. For many of them, this year’s biennale represents their first contact with contemporary art, or at least the kind aimed at global connoisseurs. “It’s fun, it’s free, it’s beautiful and it’ssoInstagrammable,” said Sokna Mbene Thiam, a 17-year-old high school student who came on a recent afternoon with two classmates.

"On the Outskirts of Beirut, a Crowd Watches the War, and Waits for Its End",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/world/middleeast/lebanon-dahiya-hezbollah-israel-airstrikes.html,"Middle EastCrisis Advertisement Supported by Lebanon dispatch Every night, dozens gather at the hillside to watch airstrikes rain down on the city’s southern suburbs. The ritual offers a window into the war — and proof that the once unimaginable is really happening. ByChristina Goldbaum Reporting from Baabda, Lebanon The crowds gather every evening on a scenic hillside on the outskirts of Beirut. Young men, old couples and local journalists, all drawn by the unobstructed view of the Dahiya, the cluster of neighborhoods south of Beirut that has been pummeled by Israeli airstrikes over the past two months. As dusk settles, people seated on motorcycles and atop cement barriers anxiously wait for the war to unfold in front of them. When there is a thunderous boom of an Israeli airstrike, they quickly scan the skyline for a plume of white smoke curling into the air — the first clue as to what may have been hit. “Look, look at the balcony, there. Do you see it?” Osama Assaf, 43, said one recent evening, pointing into the distance. “Where? By the highway?” a young man standing beside him replied. As the war between Hezbollah and Israel has escalated, the gathering at the escarpment has become a nightly ritual in Baabda, a mountainous suburb on the southeastern outskirts of Beirut, Lebanon’s capital. In peacetime, the area is a picnic spot, where old friends and young lovers smoke fruit-flavored tobacco through water pipes and watch a deep red sun melt into the Mediterranean Sea. These days, the hillside offers a window into the war that has decimated the enclave south of the city in the Dahiya. A cramped patch of high-rise apartments, office buildings and narrow one-way roads, the Dahiya is home mostly to Shiite Muslims and is effectively governed by Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group and Shiite political movement in Lebanon. Airstrikes that Israeli officials say are targeting Hezbollah military facilities in the Dahiya have transformed the area into a bombed-out ghost town coated in gray ash and littered with rubble. The hillside overlooking the Dahiya first drew local TV reporters who offered grim updates about the war. Soon, Dahiya residents who had fled the area began converging there as well. Some are desperate to know firsthand if their neighborhood will survive another day. Others are bored, their usually busy lives upended by the war. Occasionally, young Christian men who live nearby come to cheer on the destruction of the mostly Shiite neighborhoods — a glimpse of the sectarian tensions always simmering Lebanon.

Bathing in Oil at a Climate Summit? It Leaves a Stain.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/europe/cop29-azerbaijan-oil-baths.html,"Advertisement Supported by Azerbaijan Dispatch In Azerbaijan, site of the COP29 climate talks and a petrostate, people aren’t only proud of their oil. They swear by its health benefits and visit resorts to soak in it. ByAnton Troianovski Reporting from Naftalan, Azerbaijan I bathed in oil during the U.N. climate summit. It was crude oil from a half-mile underground, pumped into a bathtub at a hotel in Azerbaijan. It crept into every crevice of my submerged body and every fold of my skin. It smothered the hair on my limbs, making me look a little like an animal stuck in an oil spill. Then came an attendant to scrape it all off. Just a day earlier, I had been covering the United Nations’ annual climate conference, COP29, which is being held this month in Baku, Azerbaijan, a place that helpedgive rise to the modern oil industrymore than a century ago, enabling and endangering our civilization. Much has been made of the incongruity of those fighting to reduce fossil-fuel emissions gathering in a petrostate, but Azerbaijanis are proud of their oil, whatever conference attendees might think of it. For instance, it fueled the Soviet defeat of the Nazis in World War II. Another point of pride lies beneath the dusty, shrub-dotted hills of Naftalan, a city a four-hour drive from Baku. The chocolate-colored oil extracted there doesn’t burn. Instead, the locals and Azerbaijani scientists say, it heals. If you bathe in it. But this oil, like all oil, is a finite resource. Naftalan’s recoverable deposits of “medical” oil were already halfway gone as of 2022. So the photographer Emile Ducke and I traveled there for an intimate encounter with the dwindling substance.

‘No Use for Hatred’: A Village Seeks to Move On From a U.S. Massacre,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/world/asia/my-lai-massacre-vietman-museum.html,"Advertisement Supported by Vietnam Dispatch The hamlet of My Lai is infamous for American war crimes, but now it holds lessons in resilience and how to let go of anger. ByDamien Cave Damien Cave reported from the village of Son My, the site of the My Lai massacre. The strawberry ice cream for sale by the ticket booth seemed out of place at the museum to the My Lai massacre, one of America’s most ghastly crimes of war. The parking lot held a single car. Only a wide sign near the entrance explained the significance of the location. It showed a map of the area as it looked on the morning of March 16, 1968, when a company of American soldiers showed up and killed more than 500 women, children and older men, raping girls, mutilating bodies and burning homes with families still inside. One of the massacre’s survivors, Nguyen Hong Mang, would tell me later that he had met the soldiers with a smile, shouting, “Welcome, Americans!” He was 14. Minutes later, he and his family and neighbors were being lined up and shot, crumpling into a pile of the dead and nearly dead. Retelling such horrors, to visiting strangers and with a museum right where you live, takes a special kind of courage. Most war memorials in Vietnam focus on revolutionary heroes. My Lai is pure tragedy. And the way the affected hamlets deal with one of the war’s worst atrocities says a lot about how to honor trauma without becoming defined by its scars.

Three years ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked Mélanie Joly to become foreign affairs minister, among the most prestigious and highest profile portfolios in Canada’s cabinet. But Ms. Joly, who at the time held a significantly less influential ministerial role, turned him down flat. Her refusal wasn’t because of the fact that she lacked foreign policy experience. She said no because she feared that the travel involved in the globe-trotting job would force her to abandon her yearslong quest to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization. But Canada’s leader refused to give up. Mr. Trudeau offered to make whatever arrangements necessary to maintain Ms. Joly’s treatment anywhere in the world. “‘If you become pregnant,’” she remembers him telling her, “‘it would be a fantastic message you would send to the world.’” After consulting her husband, parents and siblings, Ms. Joly relented, becoming Canada’s top diplomat.

"As Russia Advances in Ukraine, a Cop Has to Flee City After City",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/europe/ukraine-donbas-wartime-policing.html,"Russia-UkraineWar Advertisement Supported by The Global Profile For Volodymyr Nikulin, being a wartime police officer means aiding evacuees, surviving a shrapnel wound and tackling looters. It also means quickly switching cities when one falls to the invaders. ByConstant Méheut Constant Méheut followed Volodymyr Nikulin for two days in the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. The belongings of Volodymyr Nikulin, a Ukrainian police officer stationed near the country’s eastern front line, boil down to this: a shrapnel-riddled car, a small sack stuffed with sweaters and pants, and two plastic bags filled with basic food and medicine. Keeping it simple is essential for Mr. Nikulin, who has had to leave three cities to escape the advance of Russian forces in the country’s eastern Donbas region, losing his home each time. So he has learned to live with little, and to be ready to pack up on short notice. He has barely bothered to settle into the friend’s apartment he currently occupies in Sloviansk, a city 15 miles from the combat zone, leaving the bedroom untouched and sleeping instead in a small office. The distant rumble of Russian bombing regularly echoes through the walls, a reminder he may soon have to leave everything behind, again. “Who knows where I’ll be in a few months?” Mr. Nikulin said on a recent morning last month in Sloviansk, acknowledging thatRussian forces in the area were creeping closer. He joked that he could at least count on his damaged car, recalling how it had helped him escape several Russian attacks. “It’s my lucky car,” Mr. Nikulin, a 53-year-old police lieutenant colonel, said with a thin smile. Mr. Nikulin’s story of fleeing city after city under assault —Donetsk in 2014, when Russian-backed separatists took control of the city; and then, after Russia’s full-scale invasion began,Mariupol in 2022andMyrnohrad this summer— is emblematic of the plight of millions of Ukrainians displaced by the war. Like many, he has left beloved towns, watched his homes be destroyed or occupied, and mourned neighbors killed in the fighting. As a police officer evacuating besieged cities, he has also braved ordeals, including helping journalists escape Mariupol so they could revealharrowing images of the Russian onslaught there.

"Once China’s ‘Worst Nightmare,’ Labor Activist Refuses to Back Down",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/asia/china-labor-rights-han-dongfang.html,"Advertisement Supported by The Global Profile Neither jail nor exile to Hong Kong has stopped Han Dongfang, a former Tiananmen Square protest leader, from championing workers’ rights. “If you’re born stubborn, you go everywhere stubborn.” ByAlexandra Stevenson Reporting from Hong Kong Han Dongfang was just another dot in a sea of agitated university students during the mass protests in Tiananmen Square 35 years ago when he suddenly jumped onto a monument to speak. “Democracy is about who decides our salaries,” Mr. Han, now 61, recalled shouting out to the crowd from the Monument to the People’s Heroes in Beijing. “Workers should be able to take part in the decision.” It was one of the first times during the protests that anyone had mentioned workers. And it marked the beginning of Mr. Han’s three-decade fight for their rights in China, a struggle that was almost brought to an immediate halt. On June 4, 1989, just weeks after Mr. Han began his speeches, the People’s Liberation Army fired on pro-democracy protesters in the square, putting a bloody end to the democracy movement and free speech in China. The crushing response also disbanded the labor union he had helped to create during the protests — the first and only independent union since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. After Mr. Han was placed on a “most wanted” list, he turned himself in to face prison, where he served 22 months. Today, Mr. Han is one of China’s last remaining labor rights activists not in hiding. Stripped of his Chinese passport and kicked out of mainland China in 1993, he does his work from Hong Kong. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Pero para Sheynnis Palacios, lo que se suponía que iba a ser un gozoso logro se ha convertido en un camino delicado. PorJames Wagner Fotografías porKirsten Luce Reportando desde Nueva York y Ciudad de México A principios de este año, a Sheynnis Palacios le tomaban las medidas en una tienda de confección personalizada de Manhattan. Después de todo, Miss Universo siempre necesita ropa nueva. Para el interior de su chaqueta hecha a la medida, pidió que le cosieran el dibujo de un ratón, en homenaje a un apodo que le puso su bisabuelo fallecido porque le encantaba tomar queso del refrigerador a escondidas. También quería que el traje tuviera flecos azules y blancos. “Es por mi país”, le dijo a Ksenia Konovalova, la modista. “La bandera”. Mientras las dos mujeres charlaban sobre diferentes estilos de chaquetas, Konovalova preguntó a Palacios si seguía viviendo en Nicaragua. La sala se quedó en un incómodo silencio. Finalmente, un asistente de Miss Universo intervino para decir que Palacios vivía en Nueva York como parte de sus obligaciones. Normalmente, una corona de Miss Universo es motivo de celebración en un país. Cuando Palacios la obtuvo, era la primera vez que una concursante de Nicaragua, un país de siete millones de habitantes, se alzaba con la corona. Al instante, la joven de 24 años de origen humilde se convirtió en una heroína en su país, donde la gente la celebró en las calles de Nicaragua, cantando el himno nacional y ondeando la bandera del país.

She Was the First Nicaraguan to Be Crowned Miss Universe. Can She Ever Go Home?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/world/americas/miss-universe-nicaragua.html,"Advertisement Supported by The Global Profile After Sheynnis Palacios won the Miss Universe title, her country’s government arrested the family members of the Miss Nicaragua contest director, and she hasn’t returned home since. ByJames Wagner Photographs byKirsten Luce Reporting from New York and Mexico City At a custom clothing shop in Manhattan earlier this year, Sheynnis Palacios was getting measured for new clothes. Miss Universe, after all, always needs fresh outfits. For the inside of her bespoke jacket, she asked for a sewed sketch of a mouse — a tribute to a nickname given to her by her late great-grandfather because she loved sneaking cheese from the refrigerator. She also wanted the suit to have blue and white fringe. “It’s for my country,” she told Ksenia Konovalova, the clothier. “The flag.” As the two women chatted about different styles of jackets, Ms. Konovalova asked Ms. Palacios if she was still based in Nicaragua. The room fell awkwardly silent. Finally, a Miss Universe assistant stepped in to say that Ms. Palacios lived in New York as part of her duties. Normally, a Miss Universe crown is a cause for celebration in a country. When Ms. Palacios won, it was the first time a contestant from Nicaragua, a country of seven million people, had claimed the crown. Instantly, the 24-year-old from humble beginnings became a hero in her homeland as people celebrated her in Nicaragua’s streets, singing the national anthem and waving the country’s flag. But things quickly got complicated.

FIFA Bends Own Rules to Give Saudi Arabia Coveted 2034 World Cup,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/saudi-world-cup-human-rights.html,"Advertisement Supported by Critics objected to the bidding process, and human rights groups raised concerns about workplace safety for the migrants who will build the stadiums needed to host the event. ByTariq Panja Reporting from Zurich Under its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia has unleashed a spending spree on global sports, turning the kingdom into a contender for the biggest events. On Wednesday, soccer’s governing body delivered Saudi Arabia the biggest prize of all: the men’s World Cup in 2034. No other competition on the planet attracts as many eyeballs as the century-old quadrennial, a national team competition that thrusts host nations into center stage in a way only the Summer Olympics can match. But human rights groups objected to the Saudi bid, saying the country’s human rights record raises risks for the thousands of migrant workers from some of the poorest parts of the earth who will likely be brought in to build the infrastructure — stadiums, airports, roads and hotels, and even a new city — to stage the tournament. Other critics, including fan groups, said FIFA — the soccer global body that almost collapsed a decade ago after many of its top leaders were indicted on corruption charges by the U.S. Department of Justice — had rigged the vote for the Saudis by changing the rules for bidding. Under FIFA’s rules, the organization’s 211 member nations are supposed to select one tournament host during a single vote, and usually there are multiple contenders. This year, though, FIFA’s members picked hosts at the same time for two tournaments: the World Cup in 2030 and 2034. And they were asked to make their selection in a package deal, essentially approving the bids for both tournaments, or for neither. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

I Tried to Teach My Son Soccer. Here’s What He Taught Me.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/europe/rory-smith-soccer-coaching.html,"Advertisement Supported by After decades reporting on soccer, three months helping to coach a team of children under age 7 came as a revelation. ByRory Smith Rory Smith has been watching soccer for 40 years and reporting on it for 20, eight of them at The New York Times. A few weeks ago, the soccer team that occupies rather more of my thoughts than is healthy had a problem. Well, strictly speaking, it had several. One was that all of the players, including my son, were under the age of 7, which it turns out is something of a tactical limitation. Another was that I had been roped into being one of the coaches. More urgently, though, we kept conceding goals. Avoidable goals. Silly goals. Goals wrapped up in gift paper and presented to the opposition, accompanied by a heartfelt card. Technically, when children start playing formal soccer in England — at the age of 6 — the games are not competitive. There is no league table. The results are not even recorded. That arrangement is not quite the same, though, as nobody knowing what the results are. And it was apparent, to anyone who could count, that our results were not good. It was at this point that I hatched a plan to limit the damage. It seemed to me quite a good plan. We had spent two years encouraging the children to play soccer the way it is meant to be played. They pass out from the back. They take a touch. They rely on their technique to avert danger. They express themselves. But it had become very clear, very quickly that this approach had not survived contact with reality. We were conceding goals in great bucket loads because we kept creating problems for ourselves: dribbling across our own box, passing aimlessly into the middle of a congested field, turning not into space but into trouble. We kept losing games. And while winning or losing was not supposed to matter, we worried that, sooner or later, the children would start losing enthusiasm.

‘Change the Game’: Saudi Arabia Takes a Stride Into Women’s Tennis,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-womens-tennis-association.html,"Advertisement Supported by The kingdom, which has been accused of trying to “sportswash” its human rights record, hosted the WTA Finals, part of its unstoppable advance into the world of sports. ByIsmaeel NaarandVivian Yee Ismaeel Naar attended the WTA singles final in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, on Saturday night. Vivian Yee reported from Cairo. The sellout crowd was bathed in purple light and the screens ringing the stadium flashed a countdown to a clubby beat. The latest conquest in Saudi Arabia’s unstoppable advance into the world of sports — soccer, golf, boxing, car racing, now tennis — was about to begin. The Women’s Tennis Association Finals had come to Riyadh. For one night, the capital of an authoritarian, conservative kingdom where progress onwomen’s rightsis still stop-and-go was about to be home to one of the most prestigious events in women’s tennis. “Change the game,” an announcer intoned just before the players in the singles final, Coco Gauff of the United States and Zheng Qinwen of China, emerged onto the court to huge cheers from the crowd, which included many Saudi women. “Redefine power.” In another place, those words might have come off as little more than a girl-power slogan for women’s sports. But in Saudi Arabia on Saturday night, it was the host country redefining who held power in women’s tennis and beyond. For years now, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler, has used Saudi oil riches to remake his staid kingdom into a global player with glitz to match, pairing tectonic social changes withintensifying repression. Sports are amajor partof the crown prince’s transformationalpush. Saudi Arabiamuscled into professional golfby pouring $2 billion into an upstart competitor to the PGA Tour, which disdained the Saudi league before eventually deciding to partner with it. The country burst onto the international soccer scene by purchasing the English Premier League team Newcastle United, luring some of the biggest names in soccer to the Saudi Pro League and winning a bid to host the 2034 World Cup.

ByHisako UenoandJohn Yoon Hisako Ueno reported from Tokyo, and John Yoon from Seoul. Jun Mizuno’s bar in Toyama, Japan, used to open at 5 p.m. But after Shohei Ohtani began his first season with the Los Angeles Dodgers this year, Mizuno started opening at 8 a.m. so his customers could cheer for the national baseball hero over whiskey highballs and lemon soju sodas.

Mizuno turned on the TV in his bar, Otoko Bar Mizuno Sake Store, and his regulars watched Ohtani win his first World Series, asthe Dodgers beat the Yankees, 7-6, in Game 5. “The entire country is thrilled,” Mizuno said, as a banner of Ohtani as tall as his bar hung outside the entrance.

Eagles Players Feared Crime in Brazil. Have They Considered Philadelphia?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/world/americas/eagles-packers-nfl-game-brazil-crime.html,"Advertisement Supported by Some N.F.L. players called Brazil dangerous ahead of the league’s first game in South America on Friday. Statistics show their home city is deadlier. ByJack NicasandSara Ruberg Jack Nicas reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Sara Ruberg from New York. “I do not want to go to Brazil.” To National Football League executives, who haveworked for yearsto bring Friday night’s opening-weekend game to Brazil, the comment from Philadelphia Eagles player Darius Slay on his podcast last week had already gotten off to a bad start. Then it got worse. “They already told us not to leave the hotel,”he continued. “The crime rate is crazy. You know what I’m saying? I’m like, N.F.L., why do you all want to send us somewhere with a crime rate this high?” He had told his family to stay home, he added, and hoped he would make it home safely. Because “boy, they’re talking about it is crazy down there.” Slay was not the only Eagles player concerned. AJ Brown, a wide receiver,told reportershe planned to stay in his hotel room after the team had given players a long list of “don’t do’s” for Brazil. The list included “a lot, honestly,” he said. “Even as simple as just walking down the street with your phone in your hand.” What the Eagles staff apparently did not mention: Philadelphia is far deadlier than São Paulo. Last year, São Paulo registered 4.2 murders per 100,000 people, one of the lowest rates in Brazil. In Philadelphia, the murder rate was six times as high, at 26.1 per 100,000 people, even surpassing the murder rate of 23.1 across Brazil, according to theHomicide Monitor, a database of government statistics from the Igarapé Institute, a research institute that studies security.

"Bashar al Asad no planeaba irse de Siria, según un comunicado",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/12/16/espanol/mundo/bashar-al-asad-siria-rusia.html,"The New YorkTimes en Español Advertisement Supported by El exdirigente sirio dijo que fue evacuado por las fuerzas rusas después de que una alianza rebelde tomara la capital, pero que había querido quedarse y luchar, según una publicación del lunes en redes sociales. PorMatthew Mpoke Bigg El exdirigente sirio, Bashar al Asad, dijo que fue evacuado de Siria por las fuerzas rusas después de que una alianza rebelde tomara la capital, pero que había querido quedarse y luchar, según una declaración publicada el lunes en las cuentas de redes sociales que utilizaba mientras ocupaba el cargo y difundida por los medios de comunicación estatales rusos. La declaración, que decía haber sido emitida desde Moscú, contenía lo que parecían ser los primeros comentarios públicos de Al Asad desde el derrocamiento de su gobierno hace poco más de una semana. En él, defiende su historial durante la larga y brutal guerra civil del país, critica a sus nuevos dirigentes y da detalles de su huida de Siria. La agencia estatal rusa de noticias, Tass, publicó el lunes en su sitio web una parte de la declaración. Al Asad dijo que no había planeado abandonar el país, y afirmó que no “consideraba dimitir ni buscar refugio”. Dijo que había permanecido en Damasco “cumpliendo con mis obligaciones” hasta la madrugada del 8 de diciembre, cuando, según dijo, los rebeldes empezaron a infiltrarse en la capital. En ese momento, se trasladó “en coordinación con nuestros aliados rusos” a la ciudad costera siria de Latakia, a las afueras de la cual Rusia tiene una base militar, dijo. “A medida que la situación sobre el terreno seguía deteriorándose en la zona, la propia base militar rusa se vio sometida a un ataque intensificado mediante drones. Sin medios viables para abandonar la base, Moscú pidió que el mando de la base organizara una evacuación inmediata a Rusia la noche del domingo 8 de diciembre”, dijo Al Asad en el comunicado, publicado en inglés. Este relato del episodio no ha podido ser confirmado de forma independiente. El Kremlin dijo que Al Asad había tomado la “decisión personal” de abandonar el cargo y que el presidente Vladimir Putin le había ofrecido el exilio a él y a su familia. Dmitry S. Peskov, portavoz del Kremlin, ha dicho queMoscú no revelará detallessobre el paradero de Al Asad en Rusia.

La guerra de Birmania ha obligado a médicas y enfermeras a prostituirse,https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/12/16/espanol/mundo/birmania-guerra-prostitucion.html,"The New YorkTimes en Español Advertisement Supported by Tras casi cuatro años de conflicto civil, la economía está en ruinas y la población está desesperada. PorSui-Lee Wee Tras siete años de estudios de medicina en Birmania, May consiguió por fin su objetivo de convertirse en médica. Pero un mes después de graduarse y encontrar trabajo, sus sueños empezaron a desvanecerse. En febrero de 2021, los militares de Birmania dieron un golpe de Estado y la economía del país, ya afectada por la pandemia, empezó a tambalearse. Los precios se dispararon y el sueldo de May, el equivalente a 415 dólares al mes, se evaporó aún más rápido. Con su padre enfermo del riñón, se desesperaba cada vez más. Entonces conoció a las “chicas de las citas”, quienes ganaban el doble que ella. El dinero era tentador, aunque implicara sexo con hombres. “Es difícil aceptar que, a pesar de todos mis años de estudio para convertirme en médica, ahora haga este tipo de trabajo solo para llegar a fin de mes”, dijo May, de 26 años, que lleva más de un año trabajando como prostituta en Mandalay, la segunda ciudad más grande de Birmania. Ella, como otras personas que hablaron para este artículo, pidió no ser identificada por su nombre completo porque su familia no sabe cómo gana dinero y la prostitución es ilegal en Birmania. Elgolpe de Estado y la guerra civil que le siguióhandevastado la economía de Birmania. La inflación se disparó hasta el 26 por ciento este año, ya que la escasez de energía paralizó las fábricas, las lluvias inusuales inundaron las granjas y los combates en zonas próximas a China y Tailandia diezmaron el comercio transfronterizo. La moneda, el kyat, ha perdido dos quintas partes de su valor frente al dólar este año. Casi la mitad de la población de Birmania vive ahora en la pobreza, según el Banco Mundial.

"Lisonjas, súplicas y halagos: Ucrania presenta su caso a Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/12/15/espanol/mundo/ucrania-trump-ayuda-rusia.html,"The New YorkTimes en Español Advertisement Supported by Los funcionarios ucranianos, incluyendo el presidente Volodímir Zelenski, están haciendo todo lo posible para atraer al presidente electo Donald Trump a su bando. PorConstant MéheutKim BarkeryMaria Varenikova Reportando desde Kiev, Ucrania Desde intentos desesperados de diplomacia hasta extravagantes expresiones de adulación, los funcionarios ucranianos están haciendo todo lo posible para atraer al presidente electo Donald Trump a su bando, mientras intentan reforzar su posición en la guerra contra Rusia. El presidente de Ucrania, Volodímir Zelenski, viajó casi 2500 kilómetros el pasado fin de semana con la esperanza de poder reunirse con Trump en París. (Se reunieron). Los dirigentes ucranianos han retrasado la firma de un importante acuerdo de cooperación en materia de minerales con Estados Unidos, con la intención de dejar que Trump se atribuya el mérito tras asumir el cargo. (En lugar del presidente Biden). Un legislador ucraniano incluso propuso a Trump para el Premio Nobel de la Paz. “El destino de Ucrania depende de Trump”, dijo el legislador, Oleksandr Merezhko. Dijo que había propuesto espontáneamente a Trump para el premio el mes pasado por su promesa de llevar la paz a Ucrania y su decisión de vender al paísmisiles antitanque Javelindurante su primer mandato. “Deberíamos apreciar lo que ha hecho por nosotros. Deberíamos estarle agradecidos”. Desde las elecciones de noviembre, los ucranianos han intentado repetidamente presionar al presidente electo, conocido por su escepticismo sobre el apoyo estadounidense al esfuerzo bélico de Ucrania e incluso sobre el propio Zelenski. Trump declaró recientemente a larevista francesa Paris Matchque poner fin a la guerra en Ucrania sería su principal prioridad en política exterior tras su toma de posesión el mes próximo. Ha prometido intentar iniciar conversaciones de paz en cuanto asuma el cargo. Con su ejército perdiendo terreno en el este de Ucrania, los mensajes públicos de Zelenski han cambiado desde la elección de Trump. Presenta a Ucrania como un país abierto a negociaciones que podrían implicar concesiones, incluida la cesión del territorio ocupado por Rusia en el este y su posterior recuperación mediante la diplomacia. Esto pretende ser una señal para el equipo de política exterior de Trump de que el dirigente ucraniano es razonable en comparación conel chocar de espadas con carácter nucleardel presidente de Rusia, Vladimir Putin.

Supported by PorChristina Goldbaum Fotografías porDaniel Berehulak Reportando desde Damasco, Siria, y sus alrededores Miles de personas acudieron al día siguiente de la llegada de los rebeldes a Damasco, corriendo por el antaño desolado tramo de carretera, subiendo por un sendero irregular excavado en la ladera de piedra caliza y atravesando las imponentes puertas metálicas de la prisión más tristemente célebre de Siria. Inundaron los pasillos repletos de celdas, en busca de seres queridos que habían desaparecido en el agujero negro de las prisiones de tortura bajo el gobierno de Bashar al Asad. Algunos revolvieron las oficinas dela prisión, Sednaya, en busca de mapas del edificio y registros de presos. Una mujer ponía frente a otras personas que pasaban por allí una fotografía de su hijo desaparecido, con la esperanza de que alguien lo hubiera encontrado. “¿Lo reconoces?”, suplicaba. “Por favor, por favor, ¿lo has visto?”. En el vestíbulo de una sección, decenas de hombres con mazos y picos destrozaban el suelo, convencidos de que había celdas secretas con más prisioneros bajo tierra.

Tice’s Mother Asks Netanyahu for Pause in Syria Strikes to Search for Journalist,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/middleeast/austin-tice-mother-netanyahu-israel.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Debra Tice wrote to the Israeli prime minister that her family had “credible information” that Austin Tice may be held in a prison outside Damascus, in an area where Israel had been conducting military operations. ByAdam Entous Reporting from Washington The mother of the missing American journalist Austin Tice has told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in a letter that her family has “credible information” that Mr. Tice may be held in a prison outside the Syrian capital, Damascus, and urged the Israelis to pause military strikes in the area to allow rescuers to search the site. Mr. Tice’s mother, Debra Tice, said in the letter, dated Dec. 14 and addressed to Mr. Netanyahu, that the prison was under a Syrian military museum in the mountainous Mount Qasioun area and had a tunnel that was connected to a neighborhood and a government palace. “We are aware that your military has an active campaign in the area, preventing rescuers from approaching and accessing the prison facility,” Ms. Tice wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. “We have no way of knowing if the prisoners there have food and water. We urgently request you pause strikes on this area and deploy Israeli assets to search for Austin Tice and other prisoners. Time is of the essence.” Mr. Netanyahu’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Israeli military has been bombing weapons depots and air defenses in Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based organization that tracks the conflict in Syria. Israel has said it wants to keep military equipment away from extremists. Mr. Tice was abducted in 2012 outside Damascus as the country descended into civil war. The United States has said it believes he was being held by the government of Bashar al-Assad.The Assad regime had long maintainedthat it was not holding Mr. Tice and had no information about him. Mr. Tice’s family and the United States government havestepped up effortsto locate him since Dec. 8, when rebel groups seized Damascus after overrunning several other major cities, and Mr. al-Assad fled to Russia.

12 Die at Georgian Ski Resort From Suspected Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/europe/georgia-ski-resort-carbon-monoxide-poisoning.html,"Advertisement Supported by The police say the bodies were found in a room above an Indian restaurant not long after a generator had been plugged in nearby. ByAli Watkins Twelve people were found dead of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning in Gudauri, a ski area in the Caucasus Mountains in Georgia, the country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs said. The people were found on Friday in a resting area above an Indian restaurant, where all of the victims were employed. Officials reported no evidence of violence, but found a power generator nearby. The device had been plugged in the previous day and left inside, probably after the restaurant lost power, the police said. One of the 12 who died was a Georgian national, and the other 11 were from other countries, the police said. The deaths are being investigated as negligent homicides, officials said in a statement. Gudauri, near the Russian border, is the largest and highest resort in the country, making it a popular destination for skiing and paragliding. Power generators are supposed to be run only outdoors because of the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. In the United States, portable generators are some of thedeadliest household products, in large part because of their carbon monoxide emissions and the tendency to run them indoors.

Syria’s New Leadership Takes Early Steps Toward Recognition,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-alliance.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement A little over a week after taking power, the rebel alliance that led the overthrow of the Assad regime has begun to receive diplomats in the Syrian capital, Damascus. ByVivian Yee Reporting from Cairo A little more than a week after overthrowing the longtime Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, the rebel alliance that took power in Syria was making rapid progress toward international legitimacy as its officials began to receive diplomats from the United Nations, the Middle East and Europe. The leader of therebel coalition, Ahmed al-Shara, met on Sunday with the United Nations special envoy to Syria, Geir O. Pedersen, and they discussed the unfolding political transition, according to a message on Telegram posted by the coalition. Mr. al-Shara, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, “stressed the importance of rapid and effective cooperation” to rebuild Syria, develop its economy and maintain Syria as a unified territory, the Telegram post said. Speaking to reporters on his arrival in the Syrian capital, Damascus, Mr. Pedersensaidmany challenges lay ahead for Syria and called for increased aid to assist with the country’s humanitarian crisis. Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign policy chief,told reporterson Monday that she had sent the “European top diplomat in Syria” to meet with the new government in Damascus. The European Union is the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to Syria through U.N. agencies, making the relationship with Brussels a crucial one. France’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that a team of diplomats would travel to Syria on Tuesday. And Turkey and Qatar, which were in contact with the rebels well before the surprise offensive that rocketed them from obscurity in Syria’s northwest to control of nearly the entire country, were both reopening their embassies in Damascus. Since Mr. al-Assad fled the advancing rebels on Dec. 8, the rest of the world has had to reckon with a sudden new reality in Syria: A country where nearly 14 years of civil war had left Mr. al-Assad in seemingly firm control was now in the hands of a conservative Islamist group,Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, that the United Nations, the United States, Turkey and many other countries had long designated as a terrorist organization for its early ties to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.

The overnight strikestargetedformer Syrian Army positions including air defense sites and missile warehouses, according to the war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organization based in Britain that has long tracked the conflict in Syria. Earlier in the day, an Israeli airstrike also targeted radars in Deir al-Zour’s military airport in the country’s east, the Observatorysaid. The “successive strikes” along the Syrian coast —home to Russian naval bases— amounted to “the most violent strikes in the area” since 2012, according to the Observatory. It said there were 18 airstrikes, which were particularly powerful because they were consecutive and detonated missiles in warehouses, leading to secondary explosions. The Israeli military declined to comment on the strikes. Israeli officials have previously said that the campaign in Syria is an effort to keep military equipment out of the hands of “extremists,” after an alliance of rebel groups ousted the Assad regime earlier this month. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the latest strikes, the Observatory said. Israel has struck Syria more than 450 times since the collapse of the Assad government, according to the Observatory,destroying Syria’s navyand dozens of air bases, ammunition depots and other military equipment. Israel’s militaryhas also seizedand occupied an expanse of territory in Syria over the de facto border between the two countries, including on the Syrian side of the strategic Mt. Hermon. Israel has given no timeline for its departure, apart from saying thatit would stayuntil its security demands were met. On Sunday, the Israeli government unanimously approved plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to expand settlements in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, part of an $11 million scheme to double the population in the area. The move was necessary, the prime minister’s office said, because a “new front” had opened up on Israel’s border with Syria after the fall of the Assad government. Israel seized the Golan Heights during the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and it is considered illegally occupied under international law. The head of the group leading the rebel coalition that now governs Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, said in an interview on Saturday with Syria TV, a pro-opposition channel, that Israel was using pretexts to justify “unwarranted” territorial seizures in Syria. Still, he said, Syria could not afford any further conflict and was instead focused on diplomatic solutions. “Syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations,” Mr. al-Shara said. “The priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not being drawn into disputes that could lead to further destruction.” Gabby SobelmanandVivian Yeecontributed reporting.

ByNatasha Frost Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist rebel movement that just spearheaded the overthrow of the Assad dynasty in Syria, has roots in the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. But since around 2016, the group has modified and moderated its own jihadist orientation. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has run much of the opposition-held province of Idlib since 2017, accomplishing a certain level of stability and discipline. It maintained a robust internal security force to confront other military factions and domestic critics, prompting regular protests against harsh jail conditions and what were seen as authoritarian methods. The primary question is whether these rebels, who are now trying to form a national government, can scale up what they achieved in Idlib, which is poor and agrarian with a relatively small population.Read more about what we know about their approach to governance.

The National Assembly is expected to name three justices, and to ask Han to formally appoint them. The court’s deliberations could take up to six months.

The actions followed days of deadly attacks across the territory. ByHiba Yazbek Reporting from Jerusalem Israel’s military said it carried out strikes and raids in northern Gaza on Sunday after days of deadly bombardments across the territory. The military said in a statement that it had targeted a “terrorist meeting point” in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, among other actions. Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency, reported that Israeli forces had raided a school building in the town and forced displaced families sheltering there to evacuate in unsafe conditions, killing and wounding several amid bombardment and gunfire. Israel’s military did not directly address the report but said it had struck dozens of terrorists from the air and ground, and seized additional terrorists. In central Gaza, one Israeli strike killed a Palestinian cameraman who worked for Al Jazeera and other media outlets,Al Jazeera reportedon Sunday. The cameraman, Ahmad Baker al-Louh, was killed in a strike in the Nuseirat refugee camp, the news agency said, along with five members of the Palestinian Civil Defense. Al Jazeera Media Network in a statement on Sunday condemned the strike and said Mr. al-Louh had been covering the civil defense forces’ “rescue operations of a family that was severely injured in an earlier bombing.” In its own statement, the Israeli military said that its air force had “conducted a precise strike on Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who were operating in a command and control center embedded in the offices of the ‘Civil Defense’ organization in Nuseirat.” It said that the center had been used to “plan and carry out an imminent terror attack” against Israeli troops, and that “numerous steps” had been taken to mitigate harm to civilians.

Weeks of Upheaval Have Paralyzed This South American Nation. Here’s Why.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/americas/bolivia-protests-arce-morales-mas.html,"Advertisement Supported by Protests in Bolivia triggered by a feud between the president and a political rival have caused turmoil. One fallout: fuel shortages that have left drivers lining up for gas for days. ByGenevieve GlatskyandMaría Silvia Trigo Genevieve reported from Bogotá, Colombia, and María Silvia from Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Demonstrations have rocked Bolivia for more than two months. A longstanding political rivalry has boiled over, with supporters of the president and his chief opponentclashing in the streets. Protests have blocked the movement of goods, exacerbating fuel shortages. Some Bolivianslined up for daysto buy gas. The upheaval is part of a broad level of unrest across the Andean region of Latin America. Ecuador, Peru and Colombia — Bolivia’s neighbors to the west and north — are all facing significant levels of political turmoil, causing intense anger among their populations. Behind the discontent in Bolivia is a rupture within the Movement for Socialism, or MAS, a leftist party that has dominated the country’s political landscape for two decades. Bolivia’s president, Luis Arce, and his onetime mentor, former president Evo Morales, are fighting over the party’s leadership — and both insist that they will be the party’s candidate in next year’s presidential elections. The turbulence reflects a steep decline in influence for both the leftist party and Mr. Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president and a monumental figure in the country. He held office for 14 years — longer than any other leader. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Security Strategy of Recruiting Cheap Militiamen Backfires in Africa,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/world/africa/africa-burkina-faso-militia-violence.html,"Advertisement Supported by By arming civilians who are poorly trained and have little to no respect for human rights, the military in Burkina Faso has brought the West African nation to the brink of civil war. ByElian Peltier Photographs byArlette Bashizi Elian Peltier and Arlette Bashizi traveled across northern Ivory Coast to document the violence faced by civilians who fled neighboring Burkina Faso. They were falling asleep on a thin mat that they had been sharing since they were married five years ago. Suddenly, the roar of motorcycles woke them up. Armed men then dragged Rainatou Diallo and her husband, Adama Diallo, out of bed and into their courtyard. Without a word, the men shot Mr. Diallo dead. As Ms. Diallo fled the village, one of many engulfed by violence in Burkina Faso, she recognized her husband’s masked killers: They were neighbors. Burkina Faso, a nation that once prided itself on tolerance and peaceful interethnic relations, is now home to one of the deadliest conflicts in West Africa. Since the current military leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traoré,seized power in a coup in 2022, he has escalated a war against Islamist insurgents that has now killed tens of thousands of people and displaced nearly three million others. To beef up the ranks of his embattled military, Captain Traoré’s governmentrecruited tens of thousands of meninto a civilian militia, known as the Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland. The militia was created by a previous leader to protect communities against the insurgents. But under Captain Traoré, it has spread unchecked violence and pitted local populations against each other, with minority ethic groups being brutally targeted in what some analysts fear will lead to a civil war. Acts of violence against local populations involving militiamen have more than doubled since Captain Traoré’s coup, according to data compiled by theArmed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. The militiamen have carried out executions, forced disappearances or looting every six days on average, the data shows. 100 miles MALI BURKINA FASO GHANA Ouangolodougou GUINEA IVORY COAST AFRICA LIBERIA Detail area Gulf of Guinea By The New York Times We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByAlan YuhasandDayana Iwaza The leader of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah acknowledged on Saturday that its supply route through Syria had been cut off by rebels who toppled the government last weekend, dealing another blow to Hezbollah and its patron, Iran. Before its collapse, the Syrian government had provided a land corridor for Iran to supply weapons and materiel to Hezbollah in Lebanon, bolstering the militant group’s power and Iran’s influence as its main backer. “Hezbollah has lost the supply route coming through Syria at the current stage, but this is a small detail and may change with time,” the Hezbollah leader, Naim Qassem, said Saturday in a televised speech. He added that Hezbollah — which recentlyagreed to a cease-fire with Israelafter months of war — would look for alternate means of getting supplies or see if its Syria route could be re-established under “a new regime.” He did not specifically mention the coalition of rebel forces thatswept into Damascus, the Syrian capital, last weekend, or Syria’s deposed president, Bashar al-Assad, who had for years relied on help from Hezbollah and Iran in his country’s civil war. Hezbollah’s loss of its supply route through Syria, which remains fractured, is another setback for the militant group after a year of conflict with Israel and several months of all-out warfare. In a string of blows from September until late last month, when the cease-fire took effect in Lebanon, Israeldetonated the group’s wireless devices, bombarded it withintense air raids, attacked its positions witha ground invasionand killed many of its commanders.

But the troubles for him and his country are far from over. ByChoe Sang-Hun Reporting from Seoul President Yoon Suk Yeol’sshort-lived declarationof martial law has created South Korea’s biggest constitutional crisis since the country democratized in the late 1980s. On Saturday, Mr. Yoon was impeached by the National Assembly, making him the third South Korean president to be suspended from power through such a vote. But the uncertainty over the country’s political future is far from resolved. The fate of Mr. Yoon, a deeply unpopular leader, now rests in the hands of the Constitutional Court, which will decide within the next six months whether to reinstate or formally remove him. In addition to impeachment, Mr. Yoon faces a criminal inquiry, the first ever to target a sitting South Korean president.

"Argentina’s President Receives Italian Citizenship, Angering Law’s Critics",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/europe/argentina-president-milei-italy-citizenship.html,"Advertisement Supported by Javier Milei is proud of his Italian ancestry and has tried to bolster ties with Italy’s conservative prime minister. But his new passport angered critics of Italy’s rules on citizenship. ByEmma Bubola Reporting from Giorgia Meloni’s party festival in Rome. When President Javier Milei of Argentina stepped onto the grounds of Giorgia Meloni’s party festival at Rome’s Circus Maximus, a conservative fair that mixed holiday and Italy-First energy, he found a skating rink, a Christmas tree and an upbeat, anti-woke crowd. But with the visit, he got something more than recordings of Mariah Carey and meetings with Ms. Meloni, the prime minister of Italy and a conservative ally. He also received Italian citizenship. “More than among friends, I feel like I am with family,” Mr. Milei said onstage at the event. Mr. Milei, whose grandparents emigrated from Italy to Argentina, received the citizenship because of his bloodline, Italy’s foreign ministry said this week. The announcement sparked some anger among critics of the government in Italy, who have long opposed Italy’s citizenship law for allowing people with distant Italian ancestry to get an Italian passport, but not granting citizenship to children of immigrants born in Italy. “Granting the Italian citizenship to President Milei is yet another slap in the face to boys and girls who were born here or live here permanently and have been waiting for citizenship for years and years, sometimes without any result,” Riccardo Magi, a liberal opposition lawmaker,wrote on X. Unlike the United States, Italy does not automatically grant citizenship to children born in its borders, whether or not the child’s parents are in the country legally. Liberal forces have proposed a referendum to change the law, but Ms. Meloni’s government has resisted alterations that would relax it. Instead, the Italian authorities have recently updated their interpretation of the citizenship law based on decisions by Italy’s supreme court, making it harder to obtain it through bloodlines.

Walter Braga Netto was Jair Bolsonaro’s running mate. The arrest was for meddling in an investigation into a plot to stage a coup, the police said. ByAna Ionova Reporting from Rio de Janeiro Brazilian police on Saturday arrested Gen. Walter Braga Netto, a close ally of former President Jair Bolsonaro and his running mate in 2022, according to a police official, accusing him of meddling in their investigation into a plot to stage a coup after Mr. Bolsonaro lost the election. The federal police said in a statement that they had carried out an arrest and two search warrants against people for “hindering the free production of evidence during the criminal proceedings.” The police official confirmed that General Braga Netto was the target of the arrest, which the police said in the statement was “to prevent the repetition of illegal actions.” The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the matter. The targets of the search warrants were not identified. General Braga Netto served as Mr. Bolsonaro’s chief of staff and, later, as defense minister in his administration. His arrest brings a sprawling investigation, which has already deeply implicated Mr. Bolsonaro, even closer to the former president. Last month, the federalpolice urged federal prosecutors to chargeMr. Bolsonaro, General Braga Netto and three dozen others, including members of Mr. Bolsonaro’s inner circle, for the crimes of “violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, coup d’état and criminal organization.” But the prosecutors have not yet decided whether to pursue the charges. The accusations were the culmination of a sweeping two-year investigation into what police have described as a vast, detailed and coordinated plot that sought to subvert democracy and keep Mr. Bolsonaro in power after he lost the 2022 presidential election. The plan, which police believe wasoverseen by Mr. Bolsonaro, included sowing unfounded doubts about the electoral system, drafting a decree aimed at overturning the election results, pressuring top military officers to go along with the plan and inciting Mr. Bolsonaro’s followers to storm of the nation’s capital. Mr. Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and has called the investigation political persecution. The plot also includedplans to poisonPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva just weeks before he was to take office, according to the police. In an 884-page police report of their findings delivered to prosecutors last month, investigators concluded that Mr. Bolsonaro had “full knowledge” of the assassination plan. Lawyers for General Braga Netto could not immediately be reached for comment. He has previously denied the accusations of participating in the coup plot, and his defense team hassaidthere “was never a coup, much less a plan to assassinate someone,” adding, “He has always strived for ethical and moral correctness in the search for legal and constitutional solutions.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Georgian Lawmakers Hand Presidency to Far-Right Former Soccer Star,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/europe/georgia-president-election-russia.html,"Advertisement Supported by The vote, boycotted by opposition parties in Parliament, sets up a standoff with the sitting president and deepens turmoil in the country after protests and a disputed election. ByValerie Hopkins Georgia’s governing lawmakers handed the presidency to a former soccer star turned far-right politician on Saturday, setting up a standoff with the sitting president and deepening the country’s political turmoil after weeks of protests and a disputed parliamentary election. Mikheil Kavelashvili, 53, a former striker for the Manchester City football team, was the sole candidate for the post, and the first to be chosen by an electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections seven years ago. A coalition of opposition parties boycotted the vote, because they say the parliamentary elections in late October weremarred by allegationsof vote buying, intimidation and violence. But Mr. Kavelashvili was backed by the conservative Georgian Dream party, which has held a majority in Parliament for over a decade and steered the small Caucasus nation away from the European Union and closer to Russia and China. The vote sets up a standoff between Mr. Kavelashvili, who is to assume office in 15 days, and the departing president, Salome Zourabichvili, who has sided with the opposition and vowed to stay in office until new elections are held. In apost on X, she called the result a “mockery of democracy,” comparing it to the way Georgia’s leaders were chosen when the country was part of the Soviet Union. It is unclear what she could do to prevent Mr. Kavelashvili from taking his seat. On Nov. 30, she insisted that “there will be no inauguration and my mandate continues.” But on Dec. 3, Georgia’s constitutional court rejected a challenge to the elections filed by Ms. Zourabichvili and opposition groups. Ms. Zourabichvili, who waselected by Georgia’s final popular votefor president, is pro-Western, while Mr. Kavelashvili espouses strongly anti-Western views. He claimed several times this year that Western intelligence agencies were conspiring to push Georgia into conflict with Moscow, which ruled Georgia as part of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union, until 1991.

ByChoe Sang-HunJin Yu YoungandVictoria Kim Reporting from Seoul Eleven days ago, President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea made a bold power grab, putting the country under military rule for the first time in 45 years, citing frustration at the opposition for obstructing his agenda in Parliament.

Street protests turned to celebrations outside the Assembly when news broke that the impeachment bill had passed. Mr. Yoon’s popularity has plummeted during his two and a half years in office, a term marked by deepeningpolitical polarization,scandalsinvolving his wife and anear-constant clashbetween his government and the opposition-dominated Parliament.

PorChoe Sang-HunJin Yu YoungyVictoria Kim Reportando desde Seúl Hace once días, el presidente de Corea del Sur, Yoon Suk Yeol, hizo un audaz intento de aumentar su poder, poniendo al país bajo mandato militar por primera vez en 45 años, alegando frustración ante la oposición por obstruir su agenda en el Parlamento.

Joy and Celebrations in Seoul for Protesters as Yoon Is Impeached,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/asia/celebrations-protesters-impeached.html,"SouthKorea Turmoil Advertisement “Long live South Korea!” demonstrators chanted, describing a wave of relief after days of anger over the president’s surprise declaration of martial law. ByJin Yu Young Jin Yu Young reported from outside the National Assembly in Seoul, where thousands of protesters had massed to call for impeachment. Braving the cold, the protesters seeking President Yoon Suk Yeol’s ouster had gathered in the thousands on Saturday outside South Korea’s National Assembly, where lawmakers were to decide whether to impeach the leader. The crowd was boisterous in its insistence: “Impeach Yoon!” When voting started, the protesters grew silent, their eyes glued to large screens that were livestreaming the meeting. Protest organizers, trying to keep the mood upbeat, played music as the votes were being counted. Then came the announcement by the speaker of the National Assembly: The vote had passed. The crowd roared, waving their flags and banners triumphantly in the air. Protesters jumped up and down, hugged one another, and looked to the sky, some with tears in their eyes. Balloons were released into the air. “Long live South Korea!” they shouted. For many protesters, the outcome was a relief from the uncertainty set off by Mr. Yoon’s surprise declaration of martial law on Dec. 3. His decision, which he said was to counter an opposition that was “trying to overthrow the free democracy,” was the first time a South Korean president had declared martial law since the country’s military dictatorship ended in the late 1980s. That move set off a political crisis and proved to be broadly unpopular. “This is the happiest moment of my life,” said Kim Myoung-sook, a 60-year-old Seoul resident. “Martial law is a declaration of war on the people, and I was so depressed over the past week.” Park Sun-woo, 54, of Seoul said he had come out to join the protests in recent days and was moved to see people participating from across society. “No matter the gender or age, the people came together,” he said. “Thank you to the young people who turned out. Our sons and daughters. You have grown up so well.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

U.S. in Direct Contact With Rebels Who Took Over Syria,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/middleeast/blinken-jordan-syria-transition.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Supported by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the United States was communicating directly with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the dominant rebel faction, despite its designation as a terrorist group. ByMichael CrowleyMatthew Mpoke BiggandSteven Erlanger Michael Crowley reported from Aqaba, Jordan, Matthew Mpoke Bigg from London and Steven Erlanger from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The United States has been in direct contact with the Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which overthrew the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad a week ago, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Saturday. His remarks were the first official confirmation that Washington is communicating with a group that it designated a terrorist organization several years ago but whose behavior Washington hopes to influence now that the group controls Syria’s interim government. “We’ve been in contact with H.T.S. and with other parties” in Syria, Mr. Blinken said, referring to the rebel group, after a meeting with Arab ministers in Aqaba, Jordan, to discuss how to assist Syria’s political transition. He said that the United States had communicated a set of governing principles that it is urging Hayat Tahrir al-Sham to adopt, including respect for human rights and rejecting extremism. The United States has also stressed the importance of finding and returning Austin Tice, a freelance American journalist kidnapped in Syria seven years ago. Mr. Blinken spoke at the end of a three-nation tour through the region, scheduled hastily in response to the sudden change of power in Syria. The trip, which also featured stops in Ankara, the Turkish capital, and Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, ended with the meeting in Aqaba. The abrupt demise of the Assad government in Syria has prompted celebrations but also uncertainty over how the new interim administration there can manage a transition in a country shattered by 13 years of civil war and decades of repression.

Palestinian Authority Deploys Security Forces Against Militants in West Bank,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/middleeast/palestinian-authority-west-bank-israel.html,"Middle EastCrisis Advertisement Supported by The authority, which has struggled to crack down on powerful armed groups in the territory, is under pressure from the United States to escalate law-and-order operations. ByAaron BoxermanandFatima AbdulKarim Aaron Boxerman reported from Jerusalem, and Fatima AbdulKarim from Ramallah, West Bank. The Palestinian Authority announced an unusually public crackdown on militants in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Saturday, sending armored vehicles through a city’s streets and engaging in gun battles with armed groups. Palestinian security forces began deploying in the city, Jenin, to “put an end to sedition and chaos,” said Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, a spokesman for the authority’s security services. The authority administers some West Bank areas under Israeli occupation. The forces killed a local militant leader in a neighborhood founded by Palestinian refugees, according to General Rajab and residents. “This situation cannot be allowed to continue. It is unfortunate that we now need to deploy security forces to impose order,” said Mohammad Mustafa, the Palestinian prime minister. “But we will not watch our country destroyed and be silent.” Violence in the West Bank has sharply escalated since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza. The growing power of militants in West Bank cities like Jenin and Tulkarm has prompteda deadly cycle of Israeli raids and drone strikes, which have devastated Palestinian neighborhoods. In an attempt to break the cycle of violence, U.S. officials recently urged the Palestinian Authority to escalate its own law-and-order operations in the West Bank, according to two Western diplomats and a Palestinian security official familiar with the matter.

Sweet Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/briefing/sweet-season.html,"Advertisement Newsletter The holidays are upon us. It’s time to start baking. ByVaughn Vreeland Cookie hive, assemble. Why? Because it’s the most wonderful time of the year. I’m Vaughn! You may remember me fromlast year, but if not, I’m the emcee of this tradition my colleagues and I at New York Times Cooking call Cookie Week. It’s a larger-than-life celebration of one of those little things that make the holidays so sweet — cookies! This year we rolled out seven cookies,along with fun video tutorials, from all-stars like Sohla El-Waylly, Melissa Clark and Eric Kim. I might be in there, too — you never know. A big part of our process is thinking about how to modernize the classics: colorful takes on classic shortbread, interesting yet festive flavor combinations, shapes beyond your classic circle. Cookie Week is as much a visual experience as it is a taste experience, and this year we wanted our collection of recipes to have something for everyone. In July, when we started planning this year’s cookies, we leaned heavily into nostalgia for inspiration. Yule logs, rocky road and hot buttered rum all came to us like visions of sugarplums. After months of planning, testing, filming, photographing, designing and eating (I live for quality control), our cookies finally made their debut last week. They go together like Elphaba and Glinda, and much like our favorite witches of Oz, I have been changed for good by this year’s lineup. I don’t play favorites, but I have found myself gravitating to Sohla’sholiday rocky road, a no-bake confection that’s essentially marshmallows, nuts and other fun things enrobed in chocolate and sliced into bars. She adds cookie butter to the melted chocolate so that it slices more like fudge, giving it a hint of spice and a lovely melt-in-your-mouth quality. It’s also beautiful — bejeweled with gumdrops and adorned with fun sprinkles — and comes together in minutes, making it perfect for gifting and even better for snacking.

A Rare Cross-Canada Political Consensus Forms Against Trump’s Border Threat,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/canada/canada-consensus-trump-border.html,"Global Economy Advertisement Supported by Canadian leaders agreed to tighten the border, but not on how to respond if President-elect Donald J. Trump follows through on 25 percent tariffs. ByIan Austen On Monday, Chrystia Freeland, the finance minister and deputy prime minister, will present her much-delayed fall economic statement just in time for the holidays. And the government has promised that it will address the issue that preoccupied politicians this week: how to respond to President-electDonald J. Trump’s threatto impose potentially devastating 25 percent tariffs on exports to the United States from Canada and Mexico unless the two nations tighten their borders. In pushing for the tariffs, Mr. Trump has pointed to an “Invasion” of migrants and large quantities of fentanyl from Canada. Though that claim is not supported by federal data, Canadian leaders quickly agreed that calling his bluff would be unwise. Danielle Smith, the premier of Alberta, told me this week that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “understands that with this president, he means what he says. And so when he says that the border is an issue — do something about it, we’ve got to take it a lot more seriously.” Mr. Trudeau and members of his cabinet gathered the premiers for a virtual meeting this week to lay out the federal government’s plans for the border. [Read:Drones, Dogs, Drug Labs: Canada’s Plan to Avoid Trump’s Tariffs Takes Shape] They include drones and dogs along the border, technologies to detect fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it, expanded cooperation with provincial and municipal law enforcement agencies and improved intelligence sharing with the United States. Ms. Smith, who is otherwise not given to praising Mr. Trudeau’s government, called it a “pretty robust approach.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Supported by ByChristina Goldbaum Photographs byDaniel Berehulak Reporting from Damascus, Syria, and its outskirts People came by the thousands the day after the rebels arrived in Damascus, racing down the once desolate stretch of road, up a jagged footpath cut into the limestone hillside and through the towering metal gates of Syria’s most notorious prison. They flooded the halls lined with cells, searching for loved ones who had disappeared into the black hole of torture prisons under Bashar al-Assad’s government. Some tore through the offices ofthe prison, Sednaya, looking for maps of the building and prisoner logs. One woman shoved a photograph of her missing son toward others walking by, hoping someone had found him. “Do you recognize him?” she pleaded. “Please, please, did you see him?” In the entrance hall of one section, dozens of men with sledgehammers and pickaxes tore up the floors, convinced there were secret cells with more prisoners deep underground. Crowds swelled around them as people clambered to see what they found, pausing only when Israeli airstrikes landed close enough to shake the prison’s walls. “Move back, move back!” one man, Ahmad Hajani, 23, yelled. “Let them work!” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Cajole, Plead and Flatter: Ukraine Makes Its Case to Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/europe/trump-ukraine-russia.html,"Russia-UkraineWar Advertisement Supported by Using diplomacy, flattery and the occasional shot in the dark, Ukraine is doing everything it can to win over President-elect Donald J. Trump to its side. ByConstant MéheutKim BarkerandMaria Varenikova Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine From desperate stabs at diplomacy to fanciful expressions of flattery, Ukrainian officials are doing everything they can to bring President-elect Donald J. Trump into their corner as they try to strengthen their position in the war against Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine traveled almost 1,500 miles last weekend on the off chance he could meet with Mr. Trump in Paris. (He did.) Ukrainian leaders have delayed signing a critical minerals cooperation agreement with the United States, with an eye toward letting Mr. Trump claim credit after taking office. (Rather than President Biden.) One Ukrainian lawmaker even nominated Mr. Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. “The fate of Ukraine depends on Trump,” said the lawmaker, Oleksandr Merezhko. He said he spontaneously nominated Mr. Trump for the prize last month because of his promise to bring peace to Ukraine and his decision to sell the countryanti-tank Javelin missilesduring his first term. “We should appreciate what he’s done for us. We should be thankful.” Since the election in November, Ukrainians have repeatedly tried to press their case with the president-elect, known for his skepticism about American support for Ukraine’s war effort and even about Mr. Zelensky himself. Mr. Trump recently told theFrench magazine Paris Matchthat ending the war in Ukraine would be his main foreign policy priority after his inauguration next month. He has vowed to try to start peace talks as soon as taking office. With his military losing ground in Ukraine’s east, Mr. Zelensky’s public messaging has shifted since Mr. Trump’s election. He is portraying Ukraine as being open to negotiations that could involve concessions, including ceding Russian-occupied territory in the east and regaining it later through diplomacy. That is meant as a signal to Mr. Trump’s foreign policy team that the Ukrainian leader is reasonable compared with thenuclear saber-rattlingof Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. “They want to secure their place on the new U.S. administration’s radar,” said Alyona Getmanchuk, the head of a Kyiv-based think tank, New Europe Center. “They’re trying to establish contacts, build bridges.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

After nearly a month without mail, Steven MacKinnon, the federal labor minister, said Friday that he had asked the independent Canada Industrial Relations Board to order strikers back to work if it determines the two sides are at an impasse. “Canadians are rightly fed up,” he told reporters, adding that service might return as early as next week. A wide swath of Canadian residents and businesses has been affected. But the hardest hit have been those in remote communities like Ms. Teasdale’s town of Inverness, where Canada Post is the only delivery option. Even Amazon relies on it. “We can use our sense of humor, call it a piece of our new reality,” Ms. Teasdale said. “We got around Covid and will get around this. It is what it is, I guess.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

She lost to Gwyneth Paltrow, and Brazil never got over what it considered a snub.

Millions of viewers are packing theaters to watch “I’m Still Here,” a quiet drama starring Ms. Torres about a family torn apart by a military junta that ruled Brazil, by fear and force, for over two decades.

ByJohn Yoon Reporting from Seoul While calling for President Yoon Suk Yeol’s removal, tens of thousands of South Korean protesters have danced to traditional percussion, sung a pop genre called trot and blasted “Whiplash,” a hit by the girl group Aespa. They’ve also left rallies with the melody of “Feliz Navidad” stuck in their heads. The adaptation’s repeated opening verse: “Impeachment is the answer.” The day after Mr. Yoon’s short-liveddeclaration of martial lawlast week, the protest anthem’s creator, Baek Jae Gil, performed it for thousands outside the National Assembly in Seoul. Arecordinghas received nine million views on X, and the song has spread on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. On the Chinese app WeChat, it has been translated into Chinese, he said. “If Yoon Suk Yeol gets lost, it’s a Merry Christmas,” the crowd sang along to the tune of the 1970 Christmas classic. Mr. Baek, 52, a professional musician known as Baekja, has been protesting for decades. He has seen demonstrations become more peaceful and the mood lighten since his first rally in 1989.

ByBen HubbardandRaja Abdulrahim Ben Hubbard reported from Damascus, Syria, and Raja Abdulrahim from Idlib, Syria. Jubilant crowds gathered in cities across Syria for the first Friday Prayers since rebels toppled President Bashar al-Assad, including at the historic Umayyad Mosque in the capital, where civilians and fighters worshiped side by side and joyful chants erupted over the collapse of a long authoritarian dynasty. People waved revolutionary flags, posed for photographs with friends and shouted, “God is great!” as one of the largest crowds in memory filled the marble courtyard of the mosque, where the Assad security forces had long suppressed antigovernment demonstrations with brutal violence. Not all the chants were religious, reflecting the country’s newfound sense of liberty, as some outside the mosque sang, “Hold your head high, you are a free Syrian!” Fighters in military uniforms — members of the rebel force that ousted Mr. al-Assad over the weekend — joined others at the mosque, their guns beside them or leaning against pillars nearby. The towering prayer hall was so crowded that some men could not touch their foreheads to the carpet. Instead, they touched them to the backs of the people in front of them. In a sermon delivered from the pulpit, the newly appointed prime minister of Syria’s rebel government,Mohammed al-Bashir, praised the rebellion’s victories, mourned those who had been killed during the war and called on Syrians to build a new state based on freedom, dignity and justice. “The chains of humiliation have been broken,” Mr. al-Bashir said, his voice cracking at times with emotion. He also condemned the oppression of the Assad regime and spoke of revenge against the “criminals” who had been part of it. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"What Is Captagon, the Illegal Stimulant That Made al-Assad’s Syria a Narcostate?",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/world/middleeast/captagon-stimulant-assad-syria.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement The illegal amphetamine, used across the Middle East, became Syria’s biggest export during its 13-year civil war. ByAryn Baker Rebel fighters in Syria said on Friday that they had found vast stockpiles of an illegal amphetamine called captagon in a Damascus warehouse. Captagon was the cornerstone of anarcotics-trafficking ringthat was run by relatives and associates of the deposed President Bashar al-Assad, eclipsing Syria’s legal exports and turning the country into a narcostate. But what is captagon, and how did Syria become the hub for its manufacture and distribution? Captagon is the former trade name forfenethylline, a synthetic stimulantcreated in Germanyin the early 1960s to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and narcolepsy. Most countries banned it in the 1980s because it was found to be highly addictive, with dangerous side effects that include psychosis, severe anxiety and suicidal tendencies. The illicit version sold today, often referred to as “captagon” with a lowercase c, usually contains a mix of amphetamines, caffeine and various fillers that are easier and cheaper to obtain. Produced for pennies a pill in Syria, captagon can sell for anywhere from $3 to $20 a pop on the street. It is not widely used in the most of the world but is ubiquitous in the Middle East, where it is known as ‘Abu Hilalain,’ or ‘father of the two crescents’ for the logo of two interlocking Cs stamped on each pill.

PorAryn Baker Los combatientes rebeldes de Siria dijeron el viernes que habían encontrado grandes reservas de una anfetamina ilegal llamada captagon en un almacén de Damasco. El captagon fue la piedra angular de unared de narcotráficodirigida por familiares y asociados del depuesto presidente Bashar al Asad, que eclipsó las exportaciones legales de Siria y convirtió el país en un narco-Estado. Pero, ¿qué es el captagon y cómo se convirtió Siria en el centro de su fabricación y distribución?

Critics Complain That Italy’s Government Is Interfering in the Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/world/europe/futurism-exhibition-rome.html,"Advertisement Supported by Italy’s culture ministry dismissed experts preparing an exhibition on Futurism and put in its own appointees, who created a show that seems to glorify the Mussolini years. ByElisabetta Povoledo Reporting from Rome Earlier this month, hundreds thronged to Rome’s National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art for the highly anticipated opening ofa major exhibition on Futurism, arguably Italy’s most notable contribution to 20th-century art. Coming on the heels of cubism, Futurist art broke with the past to capture the movement and dynamism of the modern age. Yet with its nationalistic and warmongering rhetoric, Futurism is also intertwined, in part, with Mussolini’s Fascist regime. Conspicuously absent at the inauguration were some of the Futurism scholars and critics who had spent the better part of the past year preparing the show. They were dismissed by culture ministry officials this summer and replaced with an organizing committee including an architect, an archaeologist and an expert in Medieval art. “I was told, ‘arrivederci’ — you never existed” said Massimo Duranti, one of the ousted experts. “The exhibition became about exalting Futurism during the period of the regime.” Massimo Osanna, the director of Italy’s state museums, denied that the changes to the committee were ideologically motivated. Duranti and others had never been formally appointed, he said, and the new panel had worked to present “an extraordinary era from many points of view.” A show about Futurism had been high on the wish list of Gennaro Sangiuliano, whose turn as Italy’s culture minister wascut short last Augustafter it emerged that he’d had an affair with a consultant in his department. Sangiuliano, a right-wing journalist and politician, had been handpicked for the ministerial post by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the hard-right leader of a party descended from post-Fascist roots.

Russia Hits Ukraine’s Energy Infrastructure in a Renewed Assault,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/world/europe/russia-ukraine-attack-energy.html,"Russia-UkraineWar Advertisement Supported by Military analysts had speculated that Moscow could escalate such attacks as a show of force after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, its ally. ByMaria Varenikova Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine Russia launched a missile attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure early Friday, in an assault that President Volodymyr Zelensky described as “one of the largest strikes” on his country’s power facilities. The attack consisted of 93 missiles and 200 drones, Mr. Zelenskysaid on social media, “including at least one North Korean missile.” Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko,said on Facebook, “Once again, the energy sector across Ukraine is under massive attack.” Of the 81 missiles that Ukraine managed to shoot down, 11 were intercepted by F16 fighter jets provided by allies, Mr. Zelensky said. He once again urged Ukraine’s partners to respond, saying, “The world can stop this madness.” The International Atomic Energy Agency had made a renewed call on Thursday for Russia to stop targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure: The agency’s board of governors signed a resolution addressing the threats that the attacks pose to nuclear safety. “The international community must increase pressure on Russia for its deliberate attempts to create a radiation disaster on the continent,” the resolution said. The agencysaid after Friday’s attackthat five of Ukraine’s nine operating nuclear reactors had to reduce their power output because of Russia’s “renewed attacks on energy infrastructure.” The first reports of damage after the assault came from western Ukraine. The Lviv and Ternopil regions reported power outages, and Svitlana Onyshchuk, the head of the Ivano-Frankivsk military administration, said on social media that her region had experienced “the most massive attack since the start of the full-scale war.” Russia launches exploding drones at Ukraine nightly. The larger waves, which combine various types of missiles along with the drones, have come every few weeks and are typically aimed at electrical infrastructure such as power plants, in a long-running campaign to black out the country. Military analysts had speculated this week thatPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia could try to escalate these attacksas a show of force after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Russia’s ally. Some analysts have said, however, that Russia is at the limits of its capacity for launching missiles, having depleted its stockpiles and firing as many missiles as its industry can produce. On Wednesday, Sabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokeswoman,said it was possiblethat Russia could fire another of a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, in the coming days. Russiafired an Oreshnik missileat a rocket factory in Dnipro in November after Ukraine began using American-provided missiles to hit targets in Russia. Anastasia Kuznietsovacontributed reporting.

Turkey Emerges as a Big Winner in the Wake of al-Assad’s Ouster,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/world/middleeast/turkey-syria-rebels-erdogan.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had long worked with the rebels who overtook Damascus. His influence over Syria is now likely to grow. ByCarlotta Gall Carlotta Gall reported from Istanbul and Antakya in Turkey. A senior international correspondent, she worked as bureau chief in Istanbul for five years from 2017. In the messy aftermath of thefall of the Assad regime in Syria, many questions remain about the country’s future, but one thing is clear: Turkey has emerged as a winner, with more influence than ever over the rebels who now control most of Syria. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had long worked with and supported the Syrian rebels who marched on Damascus this month and forced President Bashar al-Assad to flee. That carefully cultivated relationship opens up “an incredibly big domain for economic and political influence,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at Brookings Institution in Washington with a particular focus on Turkey. “Syria may not have a smooth transition, and there may be renewed fighting between factions,” she added. “But what is uncontestable is that Turkey’s influence will only grow, economically and politically.” In the process, Turkey appears to have also weakened the regional influence of Russia, which along with Iran was a key backer of the Syrian president, she said. It is unclear whether Russia will be able to retain the military bases it has on Syria’s Mediterranean coast. Initially, Turkey did not say much when the rebels swept across northern Syria, seizing two important cities in a few days. But when Mr. Erdogan finally did speak, he was quietly confident.

Emmanuel Macron Appoints Key Ally as France’s New Prime Minister,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/world/europe/france-prime-minister-government-macron.html,"France’sPolitical Turmoil Advertisement Supported by François Bayrou, a veteran centrist politician, is the fourth prime minister in a year, a record for France. ByAurelien BreedenandCatherine Porter Reporting from Paris President Emmanuel Macron on Friday tapped François Bayrou, a veteran centrist politician and one of his top allies, as the new prime minister,a move that few expect would stabilize France’s roiling politics. Mr. Bayrou becomes the country’s fourth prime minister this year — an ominous record. The task ahead is immense: He must now form a cabinet capable of shepherding bills through a fractured, cantankerous lower house of Parliament thatousted his predecessor last week. Most urgently, he will have to finalize an emergency budget to avoid a shutdown of essential state services before the new year as France wrestles withballooning debt and a large budget deficit. Mr. Macron has said he wants a broad cross-section of parties, excluding extremes on the right and left, to work together in the country’s interest. But his pick suggested a reluctance to stray too far from his agenda — despite his party’s defeat in snap elections this summer — and will do little to quell fury from his opponents. “I am fully aware of the Himalaya of difficulties that lie before us,” Mr. Bayrou said in a speech before taking office. But he said he would strive to achieve a “necessary reconciliation” of France’s divided society. Mr. Bayrou, 73, isa fixture of French politics— a former lawmaker and three-time presidential candidate who was first elected to local office four decades ago. He is the longtime mayor of Pau, in southwestern France, and he was education minister in the 1990s. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

He also had links to the Chinese Communist Party and front organizations that seek to project Chinese influence in foreign countries, the court said. “The applicant had been in a position to generate relationships with prominent U.K. figures and senior Chinese officials that could be leveraged for political interference purposes,” said the court, known as the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, in a 53-page ruling. The Chinese man, whose identity was sealed by the court pending the outcome of any legal appeal, had studied in Britain and started a company to advise British companies about investment opportunities in China. He was retained as an agent for Prince Andrew, who had worked a decade earlier as aspecial envoy for tradeand investment for the British government. Dominic Hampshire, then a senior adviser to Andrew, confirmed in a 2021 letter to the man that he “could act on behalf of the Duke in engagements with potential partners and investors in China.” Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, also has the title Duke of York. Security services obtained the letter after seizing a mobile phone and other digital devices from the Chinese man after he was stopped at the border in November 2021. He told the authorities he considered Britain his “second home.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Schuetze Reporting from Berlin Just hours after President Bashar al-Assadboarded a plane for Russiaon Sunday, thousands of Syrians who had fled to escape his rule and the civil war to unseat him celebrated in the streets across Germany. The political reaction in Berlin came nearly as quickly. By Monday, far-right and even some mainstream politicians were calling for the return of some of the nearly one million Syrians who have made Germany home. “Many refugees who have found protection in Germany are now finally hopeful of being able to return to their Syrian homeland and rebuild their country,” said Nancy Faeser, the German interior minister, who is responsible for refugees. Several European countries, including Britain, Germany, Greece, Italy and Sweden, swiftly announced that they would temporarily suspend legal proceedings considering asylum status for Syrians. Austria went a step further and announced that it would also prepare to deport Syrians whose claims for asylum fail. The primary reason cited by the various authorities was that the Assad regime from which the asylum seekers had fledno longer exists. For now, they added, it was unclear whether Syria would remain as oppressive and as unsafe as before. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The Syrian Upheaval Has Iranian Leaders Reeling, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/world/middleeast/iran-syria-assad.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement For decades, Iran poured money and military aid into Syria, backing the Assad regime in its ambition to confront Israel. Now many Iranians are openly asking why. ByFarnaz Fassihi In the days since the abrupt and unexpected obliteration of Iran as a dominant presence in Syria, the government has faced a fierce public backlash over the billions of dollars spent and the Iranian blood shed to back the Assad regime. The criticism has come from unexpected corners, including conservatives, and is flowing freely on television channels and talk shows, and in social media posts and virtual town halls attended by thousands of Iranians. It also appears on the front pages of newspapers every day. One former lawmaker, Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, said in a social media post that Iranians should rejoice at the fall of Iran’s longstanding ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. “No one will be able to waste Iran’s dollars for maintaining a spider web any more,” he said. While opponents of the government have long bristled at the money Iran has sent all over the Middle East, the sentiment now seems to have spread. Even some who fought on their government’s behalf in Syria or lost family members in the civil war there are asking if it was worth it. The Assad regime, some noted, was not the only loser to emerge from the uprising. Ebrahim Motaghi, a professor of international relations at Tehran University, said on a talk show that Iran had been reduced from regional power to merely another country. Some questioned the very foundation of Iran’s strategy over the past decades for making itself a dominant regional force that would confront Israel and its main backer, the United States: Tehran’s support for the array of militant groups across the Middle East that it called the axis of resistance.

Gas Could Mean Billions for Indigenous People in Canada.

New export terminals along the rugged Pacific coastline have reignited a generations-old debate over identity and environmental stewardship. Gas flare as seen from Kitamaat, British Columbia.Credit... Supported by ByMax Bearak Photographs and Video byPat Kane Max Bearak and Pat Kane reported from Haisla, Gitxsan and Nisga’a traditional lands in Western Canada. With her hair pulled back into a tight ponytail, her arms and legs covered with 20 tattoos, and her compact frame fitted out in athleisure, Crystal Smith, the elected chief of the Haisla people, looked more like the hometown basketball star she once was than the fossil fuel exporter she’s about to become. Ms. Smith, 45, lives in an apartment that overlooks a nearly 100-mile-long inlet — a fjord, really — whose densely forested shores the Haisla inhabited well before Europeans colonized what is today British Columbia. Through her kitchen window she can see a $31 billion natural gas export project that is about to open for business. Its flare emits a glow strong enough to penetrate the thick fog that can shroud the village of Kitamaat for weeks on end. Ms. Smith said she likes seeing the flare because it reminds her of the money it will bring her people. Shell, the fossil-fuel behemoth, operates the facility and is helping the Haisla to open their own export terminal just a few miles away. It will be the world’s first owned by Indigenous people. Canada’s lofty ambitions to transform itself into a major gas exporter rely to a large extent on Indigenous communities that control swaths of coastal territory. The expansion, which spans British Columbia’s 600-mile coastline, is controversial for a nation that has alsopledged to move itself away from planet-warming fossil fuels. The gas will be shipped to Asia to power some of the most energy-hungry economies in the world. And it will bring an influx of cash to remote Indigenous communities that have long struggled to find a place in the modern economy. But this new rush recalls the scars of past ones. This region’s land and sea have been exploited for fur, fish, gold, and timber, while native populations have been ravaged by disease, poverty and forced assimilation. The promise of billions of dollars of gas investment has renewed a generations-old debate over Indigenous identity and environmental stewardship. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"For Wild Animals, the Bird Flu Disaster Is Already Here",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/science/bird-flu-h5n1-wildlife.html,"Bird Flu Advertisement Supported by Scientists are concerned that the H5N1 virus could set off another human pandemic. But it is already putting species under pressure in the wild. ByEmily Anthes Every spring, more than 200,000 northern gannets — stocky seabirds with dazzling white feathers — journey to the coast of eastern Canada. There, they blanket oceanside cliffs and rocky outcroppings, breeding in enormous colonies before flying back south for the winter. But in May 2022, as many females were getting ready to lay their eggs, the birds began dying in droves. “Thousands of northern gannets started to wash up on our shores,” said Stephanie Avery-Gomm, a seabird biologist and research scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada. The culprit: a bird flu virus, known as H5N1, that had recently arrived in North America. Over the months that followed, the virus raced through the region, killingtens of thousandsof northern gannets. The carnage was “devastating,” Dr. Avery-Gomm said. “You have to harden your heart to work on this kind of scale of mortality.” Since a new version of H5N1 emerged in 2020, scientists have become increasingly concerned that the virus might set off the next pandemic, infecting people around the globe. But for the world’s wild birds, the prospect of a deadly, uncontained outbreak is not theoretical. The virus has already decimated avian populations around the globe, with body counts that can sometimes be staggering: an estimated24,000 Cape cormorantskilled in South Africa, more than57,000 pelicans reported deadin Peru. “The scale of the mortalities is truly unprecedented,” said Johanna Harvey, an avian disease ecologist at the University of Maryland. “There’s nothing comparable historically.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

On their first in-person date, they went to see a play, and she whispered in his ear, “I think I’ve fallen in love with you.” Soon after, they were married. And shortly after that, he was sent back to the front. When Damina Serbyn and Roman Myronenko met at a theater in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, last year after a short online courtship, they dreamed of spending their lives together in domestic bliss. But with Mr. Myronenko fighting Russian forces on the front line, that has yet to happen. Ms. Serbyn lives alone, and has to travel for hours every two weeks to see her husband, a deputy commander of a drone battalion based near the northeastern city of Kharkiv. On a recent cold winter evening, she was on a train rolling into Kharkiv that was carrying other women coming to see their loved ones at the front — a dangerous journey to a city that has comeunder constant attackby missiles and drones. When the door opened, Ms. Serbyn jumped off the train and into her husband’s arms, kissing him. When she is away, he does not feel like he is truly living, said Mr. Myronenko, 38. Ms. Serbyn, also 38, is a clerk with the government gas company. “Without her, nothing makes sense,” he said. Asthe wardrags on, and as Russian forces makesteady advances into Ukraine, soldiers are fighting with little hope of being demobilized any time soon and returning home to their loved ones. Many women, determined to maintain their relationships and keep their families strong, make risky trips to areas near the front, often taking children along. Some travel to places like Kharkiv, which are usually more dangerous than the cities and towns where they live. Others travel to frontline bases, where they are often in even more peril.

ByNatasha Frost As the allies and adversaries of Syria reckon withhow to respond to its change of government, Israel said that its military would stay in seized Syrian territory until “a new force” was established that met Israeli security demands.Here’s the latest. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that the sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Syria had created a vacuum on the border with Israel, and that it “will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities.” The deployment would be temporary, he said, but he did not give any clear timeline for the soldiers’ departure. The Israeli military has mostly deployed in a 155-square-mile zone that was intended to be a demilitarized area monitored by U.N. peacekeepers. But soldiers have also taken up positions deeper inside Syrian territory, according to Israeli officials. Any deal between Israel and the Islamist rebels who led the offensive in Syria appears distant, given their mutual animosity.

ByIsabel Kershner Reporting from Tel Aviv The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Thursday that his goal was to be able to close a deal between Israel and Hamas for a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages held there “this month.” Speaking at a news conference in Tel Aviv after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his top security and policy chiefs, Mr. Sullivan added to a renewed sense of momentum toward a deal after a long impasse, saying that “the surround sound of these negotiations is different today than it has been in the past.” After months of stalled negotiations, cease-fire talks for the Gaza Strip are picking up steam. But analysts — and Mr. Sullivan on Thursday — cautioned that a deal was not yet sealed. Over the past year, repeated rounds of talks have seen hopes rise only to be dashed days later, with both Israel and Hamas blaming the other for the impasse. From Israel Mr. Sullivan plans to travel on to Qatar and Egypt, the main countries, along with the United States, involved in mediating a deal. “You can’t rest until it actually happens. It might not happen,” Mr. Sullivan said at the news conference, adding, “but I believe it can happen with political will on both sides.” Mr. Netanyahu has indicated “that he would like to see this done,” Mr. Sullivan said.

U.S. Couple on Holiday Visit Are Shot and Killed in Western Mexico,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/americans-killed-mexico.html,"Advertisement Supported by The killings, and other violent episodes this year, have marred the first few months in office of Mexico’s new president, who has vowed to tackle the country’s bloodshed. ByEmiliano Rodríguez Mega Reporting from Mexico City Two U.S. citizens were fatally shot by gunmen on Wednesday night in western Mexico, local officials said, a setback to the Mexican government’s efforts to curb the violence gripping several regions in the country. The attack in Angamacutiro, a town in the state of Michoacán where drug gangs have battled to dominate the local economy and drug-trafficking routes, comes after several other high-profile killings and abductions in the area. The couple — identified by town council officials as Rafael Cardona, 53, and Gloria Ambriz, 50 — were both residents of California and arrived in late November to spend the holidays with family, said Magdalena Guzmán, a press officer at the Michoacán prosecutor’s office. In a message on social media, the town council said the victims were the brother and sister-in-law of the wife of Angamacutiro’s current mayor, Hermes Pacheco. Prosecutors said Mr. Cardona had been born in the United States and Ms. Ambriz was a naturalized American born in Mexico. Ms. Guzmán said there was no immediate information about why the couple had been targeted. The authorities learned of the attack after security officers found the couple’s bullet-ridden vehicle on a street in Angamacutiro. Inside was the body of Ms. Ambriz, who died at the scene, officials said. Mr. Cardona, found alive but gravely wounded, was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died early Thursday, Ms. Guzmán said. A spokesman with the United States Embassy in Mexico said officials were “aware of the situation” and tracking it closely. The State Department said in a statement: “We are aware of reports of the death of two U.S. citizens in Michoacán, Mexico. We are working to gather more information and stand ready to provide consular assistance if needed.” TEXAS mexico Gulf of Mexico GUANAJUATO Angamacutiro Mexico City Pacific Ocean MICHOACÁN 300 miles By The New York Times We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByMichael CrowleyAaron BoxermanandMichael Levenson Michael Crowley, traveling with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, reported from Aqaba, Jordan, and Aaron Boxerman from Jerusalem. As Syria’s new leaders take on the task of governing the country, world powers sent emissaries into the region on Thursday to begin trying to shape Syria’s future and their relations with the rebels who toppled Bashar al-Assad from the presidency. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, met in Jordan with King Abdullah II and called it “a time of promise but also peril for Syria and its neighbors” before flying to Turkey to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Blinken said it was essential for Syria’s new government, led by a Sunni Islamist group that the United States and others have called a terrorist organization, to respect basic principles of human rights, including the protection of minorities, and to ensure that Syria “is not used as a base for terrorism by groups like the Islamic State.” He and Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, also delivered a message to Israel on Thursday, saying that its military presence in Syria, where it has taken control of a buffer zone along the Syrian-Israeli border, must be temporary. After the Assad government fell last weekend,Israel moved troops into the areaand has carried out hundreds of airstrikesagainst the regime’s military assets, saying it worried that extremists could exploit the power vacuum and seize abandoned weapons to attack Israeli territory. “Israel is concerned that that vacuum could be filled by terrorists, by extremists, and so it moved forces into the buffer zone,” Mr. Blinken told reporters in Jordan. “It has told us and told others that that’s a temporary move, just to ensure, again, that this vacuum isn’t filled by something bad.” Damascus Lebanon Israel shared photos of its troops on Mount  Hermon.

Chinese-Flagged Ship Suspected of Cutting Cables Remains Halted Weeks Later,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/baltic-fiber-optic-cables-ship.html,"Advertisement Supported by After fiber-optic cables under the Baltic Sea were cut last month, European officials hurried to stop the Yi Peng 3. It’s still at anchor there, with no update on three nations’ investigation. ByMichael SchwirtzandHenrik Pryser Libell When two fiber-optic cables were severed under the Baltic Sea last month, European officials acted fast, with some declaring sabotage. They sent coast guard vessels to halt a Chinese-flagged commercial ship that their governments suspected of involvement. That was 23 days ago. Today, the ship, the Yi Peng 3, remains anchored in the Baltic Sea, watched over by a rotating host of coast guard vessels while Sweden, Finland and Lithuania investigate. But if officials have gained any greater insight into what happened to the cables — or whether the ship was involved — they are not saying. Asked for an update, Sweden’s foreign ministry referred to a statement from last month about the need to “await the findings of this investigation.” A spokesperson for Sweden’s Prosecution Authority reiterated that the matter was being jointly investigated, but said no further details were available. China’s foreign ministry said in a statement to The Times that it was “maintaining close communication” with the European countries involved, but had nothing more to add. The mystery surroundingthe Yi Peng 3comes at a time of heightened anxiety in Europe after a number of apparent acts of sabotage around the continent, including arson, vandalism and physical assaults. European officials have attributed many of these, including a plot detailed last month to placeincendiary devices on planes, to Russia. Last week, Estonian officials described a scheme by Russia’s military intelligence serviceto pay locals to commit acts of vandalism, including breaking the windows of cars belonging to the country’s interior minister and an editor of a local news outlet.

In Damascus, the capital, and Aleppo, they pulled down statues, tore up portraits of the Assad family and ransacked the presidential palace, denouncing Mr. al-Assad’s opulent lifestyle in a country where most people live below the poverty line. The government’s fall, on Dec. 8, was the end of a brutal civil war that began in 2011, when Mr. al-Assad cracked down on peaceful pro-democracy protests during the Arab Spring. An estimated618,000people have died, and some 12 million — more than half the country’s population — were displaced. Tens of thousands more disappeared into a prison system that was notorious for its abuses. Families have been flooding back into Syria from Lebanon, where they sought refuge during the worst of the war. They are eager to start rebuilding. In cities across Syria, jubilant crowds gathered for the first Friday Prayers since rebels toppled the Assad regime. This gallery contains graphic images.

Ocean Heat Wiped Out Half These Seabirds Around Alaska,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/climate/alaska-common-murre-birds-ocean-heat.html,"Advertisement Supported by About four million common murres were killed by a domino effect of ecosystem changes, and the population is showing no signs of recovery, according to new research. ByCatrin Einhorn The first evidence was the feathered bodies washing up on Alaskan beaches. They were common murres, sleek black-and-white seabirds that typically spend months at a time away from land. But in 2015 and 2016, officials tallied 62,000 emaciated corpses from California to Alaska. Since then, scientists have been piecing together what happened to the birds, along with other species in the northeast Pacific that suddenly died or disappeared. It became clear that the culprit was an record-breaking marine heat wave, a mass of warm water that would come to be known as the Blob. New findings on its effect on murres,published on Thursday in the journal Science, are a stark sign of the perils facing ecosystems in a warming world. “What we learned was that it was just way worse than we thought,” said Heather Renner, one of the study’s authors and a supervisory wildlife biologist at the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. About half of Alaska’s common murres, some four million birds, died as a result of the marine heat wave, the scientists found. They believe it is the largest documented die-off of a single species of wild birds or mammals. The state is home to about a quarter of the world’s common murres, scientists say. Murres were the victims of a domino effect of oceanic changes tied to the warm water, according to agrowing body of research. It affected marine life from plankton to humpback whales. Critically for the murres, it led to a collapse in the fish they depend on. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Rebel Group’s Terrorist Label Could Hinder Efforts to Aid Syria,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-terrorist-designation.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement The United States and others call Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, now taking power in Syria, a terrorist group, blocking funding and even contact with the group. Experts say that should change. ByEphrat Livni A few weeks ago, world leaders likely were not thinking about Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its designation as a terrorist organization. But now, the rebel faction that drove a surprise offensive that toppled the Assad regime is Syria’s de facto government. Suddenly, that terrorist label — used by the United States, the United Nations and others — has became a matter of international concern and debate. The designation means that countries and international organizations are severely restricted in providing aid to a Syrian government that desperately needs it to assert control, provide basic services and rebuild after years of war. Those limits could have broad consequences for Syria and the Middle East, with analysts and regional officials warning that a weak and fractured state would incubate terror groups like the Islamic State. Some experts contend that now is the time to offerHayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group, a prompt path to legitimacy. “This is that period when things fail,” said Kirsten Fontenrose, a senior fellow in the Atlantic Council Middle East program who served on the National Security Council during the Trump administration. After a regime falls, power vacuums can fill quickly, she argued, so the international community should draft a reconstruction blueprint for Syria that acknowledges Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and offers it financial incentives to transform into a political unit with no paramilitary, supportive of free and fair elections. Donors have leverage, Ms. Fontenrose said, because anyone leading Syria will need foreign aid, and the group may be at its most amenable to change now, as it seeks legitimacy and support.

Why Some British Pubs Are Running Out of Guinness,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/uk-guinness-shortages-limits.html,"Advertisement Supported by Guinness’s parent company has limited the amount of the beer that U.K. wholesalers and distributors can buy each week, after surging demand led to fears of shortages. ByAmelia Nierenberg Reporting from London British pubs are facing something of a crisis: They cannot get enough Guinness. The trouble became evident last week, when the Irish beer’s parent company, Diageo, started limiting the number of barrels of Guinness that British pubs and bars can order each week. “Over the past month we have seen exceptional consumer demand for Guinness,” Diageo said in a statement. “We have maximized supply and we are working proactively with our customers to manage the distribution to trade as efficiently as possible.” The black liquid has surged in popularityon both sides of the Atlantic Oceanin the past year. Once seen as an old-timer’s beer, it has recently become a Gen Z darling, thanks to savvy marketing, celebrity endorsements and a viral drinking challenge. Influencers and ordinary drinkers alike have been trying to “split the G,” which means drinking enough in one chug to leave the foam scything the first letter of the branded pint glasses. But now, many pubs in Britain say they can’t buy the kegs they need during the busy festive period because of Diageo’s allocation limits. As news of the restricted supply has spread, there has been some panic-buying, analysts said, exacerbating the problem. “It feels like the toilet roll shortages during Covid — the more coverage that comes, the worse the situation gets!” Richard Hall, the managing director of Inn Express, a wholesale drinks supplier, wrote in an email. Some were skeptical at first. “To be honest, I thought it might have been a PR thing,” said Tommy McGuinness, the manager of The Marquis, a pub in London, of the rumors that taps were running dry. “Turns out, it’s real.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Why Do Some Rebel Governments Last When Others Fall?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-government.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Subscriber-onlyNewsletter One factor matters most, and it could be a problem in Syria. ByAmanda Taub In Syria, “forever” is over.The regime of former President Bashar al-Assad, whose supporters once chanted “our leader forever,”has been deposed by an alliance of rebel groups after a 13-year civil war. The rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led the lightning offensive that overturned the Assad regime in less than two weeks, is now working to establish a transitional government. But chaos still reigns in much of the country, with other rebels groups fighting each other and jousting for influence, as are outside powers like Israel, Turkey and the United States. What do previous rebellions tell us about Syria’s chances of establishing a stable government? Anew studyexamined dozens of rebellions since 1900 to answer a question that has long puzzled researchers: Why are some rebel groups able to establish governments that last for decades, while others collapse into renewed fighting in just a few years? The answer, the researchers concluded, comes down to a single factor — one with sobering implications for Syria. Killian Clarke, Anne Meng and Jack Paine — political science professors at Georgetown, the University of Virginia, and Emory University respectively — collected an exhaustive data set of every rebellion that overthrew a government since 1900. The researchers examined a wide range of variables to figure out what could explain which of the rebel-founded governments survived: How long did the rebellion last? Did the rebels have the backing of a foreign government? What was their ideology? None of those factors ended up mattering much. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Trump’s Choice to Run Energy Says Fossil Fuels Are Virtuous,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/climate/wright-trump-oil-gas-energy.html,"Advertisement Chris Wright, Donald Trump’s pick for energy secretary, says oil, gas and coal are key to solving global poverty. Some call that misleading. ByLisa Friedman Chris Wright, the fracking magnate and likely next U.S. energy secretary, makes a moral case for fossil fuels. His position, laid out in speeches and podcasts, is that the world’s poorest people need oil, gas and coal to realize the benefits of modern life that Americans and others in rich nations take for granted. Only fossil fuels, he says, can bring prosperity to millions who still burn wood, dung or charcoal for basic needs like cooking food and heating homes. “It’s just, I think, naïve or evil, or some combination of the two, to believe they should never have washing machines, they should never have access to electricity, they should never have modern medicine,” Mr. Wright said on the “Mission Zero” podcast last year. “We don’t want that to happen. And we simply don’t have meaningful substitutes for oil, gas and coal today.” The argument offered by Mr. Wright, who has been chosen by President-elect Donald J. Trump torun the Energy Department, ignores the fact that wind, solar and other renewable energy are cleaner and increasingly cheaper than fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency says clean energy iscoming online globally at an “unprecedented rate”and will play a significant role in the future. In some places, renewable energy has been able todisplace fossil fuels. Mr. Wright also skates past the climate impacts from burning more fossil fuels. Climate change is already having a disproportionate impact on poor nations, which are less able than rich countries to handle the rising seas, extreme weather, drought and other consequences of global warming. “It’s pretty self-serving by the fossil fuel industry to assume the future is going to look exactly like the past,” said Joseph Curtin, a managing director on the power and climate team at the Rockefeller Foundation, which is working on expanding clean energy access in poor countries.

Mr. Boulos has been profiled as atycoonby the world’s media, telling areporterin October that his company is worth billions. Mr. Trump called him a “highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the international scene.” The president-elect even lavished what may be his highest praise: a “dealmaker.” In fact, records show that Mr. Boulos has spent the past two decades selling trucks and heavy machinery in Nigeria for a company his father-in-law controls. He is chief executive of the company, SCOA Nigeria PLC, which made a profit of less than $66,000 last year, corporate filings show. There is no indication in corporate documents that Mr. Boulos, a Lebanese-American whose son is married to Mr. Trump’s daughter Tiffany, is a man of significant wealth as a result of his businesses. The truck dealership is valued at about $865,000 at its current share price. Mr. Boulos’s stake, according to securities filings, is worth $1.53. As for Boulos Enterprises, the company that has been called his family business inThe Financial Timesand elsewhere, a company officer there said it is owned by an unrelated Boulos family.

Blinken Appeals for Unity Behind New Syrian Government,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/syria-us-jordan-turkey-assad.html,"Advertisement The secretary of state said the goal of visits to Jordan and Turkey was to unite countries behind a peaceful transition. ByMichael Crowley Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Thursday that his goal during a trip to Jordan and Turkey was to unite countries in the region behind a peaceful transition to a new Syrian government after the fall of the Assad regime. Mr. Blinken spoke to reporters in Aqaba, Jordan, after meetings with Jordan’s King Abdullah II and its foreign minister, Ayman Safadi. It is “a time of promise but also peril for Syria and its neighbors,” Mr. Blinken said. He said it was essential that Syria’s new government respect basic principles of human rights, including the protection of minorities and ensuring that Syria “is not used as a base for terrorism by groups like the Islamic State.” The rebel alliance that toppled President Bashar al-Assad is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Sunni Islamist group once affiliated with Al Qaeda, that is labeled a terrorist organization by the United States and others. In recent years HTS has softened its stand on governing according to its religious principles, insisting that it is prepared to work with all sects, but how it will operate in power remains to be seen. Minutes before his departure for Ankara, Turkey, Mr. Blinken said he had no updates on the status of Austin Tice, a freelance American journalist who has been believed held in Syria for many years. “Every single day we are working to find him and bring him home,” Mr. Blinken said. In Ankara, Mr. Blinken met with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Blinken indicated concern aboutfresh Turkish offensives against U.S.-backed Kurdish rebels in Syria’s northeast, calling it “really important at this time that we’re not sparking any additional conflicts.” Michael Crowley covers the State Department and U.S. foreign policy for The Times.

Activist Who Told the World About Torture in Syria Is Laid to Rest,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/mazen-al-hamada-syria-activist-dead.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Mazen al-Hamada spread the word about the plight of Syrians and his own abuse in the Assad regime’s prisons. He was found dead in Syria this week. ByEphrat Livni A prominent Syrian pro-democracy activist known for alerting the world to torture that he and other detainees experienced at the hands of the Assad regime did not survive to celebrate the government’s fall. Mazen al-Hamada was found dead in a hospital near the Syrian capital, Damascus, his niece, Joud al-Hamada, said in aposton Facebook on Tuesday. He was laid to rest on Thursday with a funeral procession in Damascus, the capital, with hundreds of chanting mourners carrying portraits of him as his coffin moved down crowded streets, video shot by the Reuters news agency showed. Ms. al-Hamada said in her post that she had been told her uncle had likely been dead for around a week before his body was found. In a separate post she said that he had been tortured to death. Mr. al-Hamada’s death, like his life, shed light on the violence of former President Bashar al-Assad’s rule and the debilitating effects of the torture that his government wielded as an instrument of oppression. He spent most of his life in Syria but sought asylum in the Netherlands in 2014 and began spreading the word about conditions in his home country. His family has said he was likely lured back to Syria in 2020 by false promises from the government. Even as Mr. al-Hamada was applauded for describing in excruciating detail the abuse he received in Mr. al-Assad’s prisons, including rape, the repeated recounting of his trauma began to take a toll. Friends said that in the years he spent in Europe, he began to isolate himself, and his live broadcasts on social media — once stark accounts of the regime’s crimes — sometimes devolved into hate-fueled rants against Syria’s ethnic minorities.

They are also steadily advancing through villages and settlements several dozen miles to the south, threatening to seize the last two Ukrainian strongholds in the southern part of the Donetsk region. Moscow isadvancing in Donetskat its fastest pace since 2022, capturing hundreds of square miles each month as it leverages its overwhelming manpower advantage by breaking through Ukrainian positions weakened by troop shortages. Analysts say the Kremlin is racing to secure as many territorial gains as possible before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office next month and starts topush for peace talkswith terms that are likely to be shaped by each side’s status on the battlefield. Emil Kastehelmi, a military analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, said that from September to November, Russia had seized more than 600 square miles of Ukrainian territory, roughly twice the size of New York City, almost all of it in the Donetsk region.

What I Learned From a Reclusive Taliban Commander,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/asia/lessons-learned-from-taliban-commander.html,"Advertisement Supported by Mullah Osman Jawhari led one of the deadliest assaults on American forces in Afghanistan, a battle that came to symbolize the war itself. ByAzam Ahmed Azam Ahmed, a former Kabul bureau chief, made several trips back to Afghanistan, searching for the untold stories of a war gone wrong. The Taliban commander wore sunglasses and a heavy wool coat, as if he might leave at any moment. Between us, on a plastic-covered table doused in fluorescent light, sat an untouched mountain of lamb and rice. It was our first encounter, in the winter of 2022, and he had chosen a guesthouse on a busy street to meet. The shouts of merchants and the grind of traffic wafted through an open window as I explained why I had tracked him down. More than a decade earlier, 150 Taliban fighters had laid siege to an American base in the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountain range. Nine soldiers died and two dozen were wounded in what became known as the Battle of Want (also referred to as Wanat), one of the deadliest attacks on U.S. forces in the entire war. This man, Mullah Osman Jawhari, had led that assault. It was a miracle that he was alive, frankly. During the war, midlevel Taliban commanders were regularly killed. But here he was. For more than 20 years, American journalists had largely covered one half of a war. As a former Afghanistan correspondent and Kabul bureau chief, I had, too. Much of the country had been off limits. The Taliban perspective was often limited to their propaganda. And the true story was unknown. I’d read every after-action report about the Battle of Want, every Lesson Learned. But now that the fighting was over, I wondered what we’d missed. Maybe I could gain some insight into how the war had ended so poorly for the United States (and for many Afghans, most especially women). We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Humbled in Syria, Putin Seeks Vindication in Ukraine",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/putin-syria-ukraine.html,"Russia-UkraineWar Advertisement Supported by news analysis An ally’s downfall has prompted calls in Russia for a definitive victory closer to home. ByAnatoly Kurmanaev Reporting from Berlin The downfall of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has humiliated his main backer, Russia, exposing the limits of the Kremlin’s military power and global influence. Yet to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the loss of his closest Middle Eastern ally may only be a temporary setback in his quest for a much greater geopolitical prize: triumph in Ukraine. Military and political analysts said winning the war in Ukraine has become an all-encompassing goal for Mr. Putin. That outcome, they said, would justify to the Russian leader the conflict’s tremendoushumanandeconomiclosses, safeguard Russia’s statehood and global stature and compensate for strategic failures elsewhere, such as in Syria. “Putin’s bet on the war in Ukraine is so high that a victory there would bring Russia a payout of historic proportions: It’s all or nothing,” wrote Aleksandr Baunov, a political analyst at theCarnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a research group. “If he thinks the fate of the world is being decided in the Donbas, then the future of Syria will be decided there as well.” In the short term, as Moscowmaneuvers to keepits military bases in Syria, Mr. Putin could intensify his costly offensive in Ukraine torecover some prestige. Pro-war Russian commentators have called on Mr. Putin to do just that, while also demanding tougher peace conditions in Ukraine to avoid the kind of inconclusive cease-fire that ultimately led to Mr. al-Assad’s downfall. Both scenarios would complicate the incoming Trump administration’spromise to swiftly end the fighting in Ukraine. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"In Defiant Speech, South Korea’s President Defends Martial Law Decree",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/asia/yoon-south-korea-martial-law.html,"SouthKorea Turmoil Advertisement Supported by President Yoon Suk Yeol vowed to “fight to the end,” despite the opposition’s push to impeach him and his own party’s demand that he resign. ByChoe Sang-Hun Reporting from Seoul In a surprise shift from remorse to defiance, President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea on Thursday refused to step down and lashed out at those who sought to oust him over his short-lived decision to place his country under military rule. Mr. Yoon has faced mounting pressure from all sides after his decision on Dec. 3 to declare martial law and send troops into the National Assembly. Tens of thousands of protesters have demanded his resignation, impeachment or arrest. His own party suggested that he resign early. The opposition has vowed to impeach him. The police are investigating possible insurrection charges against him. Just last Saturday — the last time he addressed his country — Mr. Yoon had sounded contrite. In a televised speech, he had apologized for his martial law declaration and said that he would let his party decide how long he should stay in office. But on Thursday, he unexpectedly doubled down on his original stance, defending the decree as a bold move to “save the country” from what he called the “anti-state” opposition parties, which he accused of using a legislative majority to paralyze the nation. “I will proudly confront it, whether it’s impeachment or investigation,” Mr. Yoon said. “I will fight to the end.” Mr. Yoon’s speech on Thursday at least made his intentions clear: He would not be pressured to resign, and he would fight in court if he were to be impeached. But his refusal to leave office risked further incensing Koreans who, according to opinion polls, overwhelmingly disapproved of his martial law declaration and support impeachment. After Mr. Yoon’s speech on Thursday, dozens of people showed up at Mr. Yoon’s residence in central Seoul, blowing vuvuzelas, beating drums and yelling, “Arrest Yoon Suk Yeol!” The police held them back.

Syria’s New Leaders Balance Huge Struggles Amid Disorder,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-retribution-fears.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Supported by The rebels who seized control called for foreign help in prosecuting atrocities, while trying to restore order in a fractured country. ByAryn BakerCassandra VinogradEuan WardandMichael Levenson The rebels who seized control of Syria confronted the challenge on Wednesday of striking a balance between obtaining justice for the victims of atrocities committed under the ousted Assad regime and preventing the newly liberated country from descending into unchecked vengeance. While Syria’s new leaders have promised amnesty for conscripted soldiers who served under the former president, Bashar al-Assad, the leader of the rebel force that toppled him made clear on Wednesday that those who helped Mr. al-Assad brutalize or slaughter would be held accountable. “We won’t pardon those complicit in the torture and murder of detainees, and we will go after them in our country,” the leader of the rebel offensive, Ahmed al-Shara, said on the Telegram messaging app. “We call on nations to hand over to us whoever of those criminals has escaped to them to subject them to justice.” Mr. al-Shara did not name any countries in particular, but Mr. al-Assad arrived in Russia over the weekend as the rebels swept into Damascus, the Syrian capital. Mr. al-Shara’s comments came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group,warnedthat armed groups had carried out retaliatory attacks on civilians in areas that were once considered loyal to the Assad government. But it was not clear who was carrying out the violence, or directing it.

PorAryn BakerCassandra VinogradEuan WardyMichael Levenson Los rebeldes que se hicieron con el control de Siria se enfrentaron el miércoles al reto de encontrar un equilibrio entre obtener justicia para las víctimas de las atrocidades cometidas bajo el derrocado régimen de Asad y evitar que el país recién liberado caiga en una venganza sin control. Aunque los nuevos dirigentes sirios han prometido amnistía para los soldados reclutados que sirvieron bajo el régimen del expresidente Bashar al Asad, el líder de la fuerza rebelde que lo derrocó dejó claro el miércoles que quienes ayudaron a Al Asad a cometer brutalidades o matanzas tendrían que rendir cuentas. “No perdonaremos a los cómplices de la tortura y el asesinato de detenidos, e iremos tras ellos en nuestro país”, dijo el líder de la ofensiva rebelde, Ahmed al Shara, en la aplicación de mensajería Telegram. “Pedimos a las naciones que nos entreguen a cualquiera de esos criminales que haya escapado para someterlo a la justicia”. Al Shara no nombró a ningún país en particular, pero Bashar al Asad llegó a Rusia durante el fin de semana mientras los rebeldes arrasaban Damasco, la capital siria. Los comentarios de Al Shara se produjeron mientras el Observatorio Sirio de Derechos Humanos, un grupo de vigilancia con sede en Reino Unido,advirtióde que grupos armados habían llevado a cabo ataques de represalia contra civiles en zonas que antes se consideraban leales al gobierno de Asad.

"In Aleppo, Residents Cheer and Refugees Return to a Jubilant but Ravaged City",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/aleppo-syria-assad.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Though excitement and frenzy were on full display in some parts of Aleppo, the city is still gripped by uncertainty after the sudden end of a 13-year civil war. ByRaja Abdulrahim Photographs byIvor Prickett Reporting from Aleppo, Syria The many monuments of the Assad regime that once dotted the Syrian city of Aleppo have been toppled, torn or burned. The large statue on which President Bashar al-Assad’s late brother was featured riding a horse has been mostly destroyed. All that remains is the rearing animal, with boys and young men clamoring to get on top of it as they flash victory signs. Across Aleppo on Wednesday there was celebration as exiled residents returned home more than a week after Syrian rebels captured the city in a lightning-fast offensive that ended with Mr. al-Assad’s ouster. They came back to their city from across the border with Turkey or from elsewhere — somewhere safer — if not permanently, then at least to assess what remained and where they might live. They set out to visit old neighborhoods and homes, some of which no longer existed. Amar Sabir, 23, fled the city nearly 10 years ago with her family and ended up in Turkey. There, she got married and had two children, but never gave up hope of returning to Aleppo. On Sunday, she did. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

ByGaya Gupta The leader of the rebel force that overthrew Bashar al-Assad called on other countries to hand over any “criminals” who had fled Syria so they could be held accountable for thetorture or killing of prisonersunder al-Assad. It wasn’t immediately clear if the comments were directed at Russia, which invited al-Assad and his family to seek exile there. The remarks by Ahmed al-Shara, leader of the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, came as a war monitor said that armed groups had carried out retaliatory attacks on civilians in areas that were once considered loyal to Assad.

"U.S. Strategy on Syria Risks ISIS Resurgence, Kurdish General Warns",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-isis-united-states-kurds.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Gen. Mazlum Kobani, commander of Kurdish forces in Syria, said recent decisions by the U.S. in Syria potentially “leaves a vacuum” that ISIS could take advantage of. ByEve Sampson The commander of Syria’s largest Kurdish militia has accused the United States of abandoning its Kurdish allies in Syria, key partners in America’s fight against the Islamic State, and warned of a resurgence by the Islamic State amid political uncertainty in Syria. Kurdish forces played an essential role in helping the United States and other countries battle the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. In the years since, as Syria languished in a protracted civil war, the Kurds, with U.S. backing, operated prisons filled with fighters accused of being ISIS terrorists, managed massive camps of displaced people and established an autonomous civil government in northern Syria. But in recent days, as rebels elsewhere in the country toppled the Assad regime, plunging the country into a new and precarious position, the Kurds, who control northeastern Syria, have come under assault by militant groups backed by Turkey, a longtime adversary. In clashes in Manbij and Kobani their forces have been attacked by fighters aided by Turkish drones and air power. As the fighting has intensified between the Kurds and Turkey-backed groups, the main Kurdish militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces, said it had to divert fighters from defending the prisons that house accused ISIS members to positions on the front lines. “This leaves a vacuum behind that can be taken advantage by ISIS and other actors,” the S.D.F.’s top general, known by the nom de guerre Mazlum Kobani, said early on Wednesday.

Blinken plans to hold meetings in Jordan and Turkey. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, is visiting Israel. ByEdward WongMichael CrowleyandEric Schmitt Reporting from Washington President Biden’s two top national security officials left for the Middle East on Wednesday as thesudden fallof Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s longtime autocratic ruler, to militias hasprompted a diplomatic scramblein the region. Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, is traveling to Jordan and Turkey, while Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, is visiting Israel, U.S. officials said. A central part of their discussions will revolve around thefuture governance of Syria. Mr. Sullivan plans to be in Israel for a few days, with official meetings starting on Thursday, said Sean Savett, a National Security Council spokesman. “Tomorrow, he’ll meet with Israeli officials as part of our close consultations on a range of important issues, including efforts to reach a hostage release and cease-fire deal in Gaza, the latest developments in Syria, and for discussions about Lebanon and Iran,” Mr. Savett said. “After that, he is planning to travel onward to Qatar and Egypt.” Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald J. Trump have both urged Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire deal that would result in the release of scores of hostages who were taken by Hamas and other armed groups in the attack on Israel in October 2023. The groups killed about 1,200 people in that assault, most of them civilians. That ignited a war in which the Israeli military has destroyed most of Gaza and killed about 43,000 Palestinians, both civilians and combatants, according to Gaza’s health ministry.

Russian Military and Commercial Activity Appears Halted at Key Syrian Port,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/russia-syria-assad.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Satellite images from last week and this week show that naval vessels docked at the port city of Tartus have left. According to marine tracking data, no cargo ships have entered or left Tartus since Monday. ByChristiaan TriebertandRiley Mellen Satellite imagery and ship tracking data reviewed by The New York Times show that Russian naval and commercial activity in the key Syrian port of Tartus — which has played a critical role in Moscow’s projection of military power in the region — has ceased since Bashar al-Assad’s government fell on Sunday. Five large Russian military vessels and a submarine were visible in the port in satellite images captured on Dec. 5 and 6, but had departed in images taken on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The satellite images captured on Tuesday show two of three frigates loitering several miles offshore. It is unclear whether the ships will stay in this location in the near future, or sail to another destination. Since the deepwater port at Tartus was established in 1971, Moscow has maintained a nearly continuous presence there, first for the Soviet Union and then for Russia. It is Russia’s only such port in the Mediterranean. Among the vessels still docked at Tartus are what appear to be several small Syrian naval ships, despiteclaimsby Israel’s defense ministry that Israeli airstrikes had completely destroyed the Syrian Navy in the port city of Latakia on Tuesday. No cargo ships have entered or departed from Tartus since at least Monday, according to ship tracking data from MarineTraffic, a commercial ship tracking agency. Two small commercial vessels arrived in the waters outside the port on Monday and Wednesday morning but have not yet docked at the port itself, according to MarineTraffic. Other ships are shunning the port entirely. Two Russian vessels thatregularlytransportgrainfrom Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine to Syria andappeared to been routefor another delivery to Tartus have altered course in recent days.

U.K. Bans Puberty Blockers for Teens Indefinitely,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/europe/uk-bans-puberty-blockers-under-18.html,"Advertisement Supported by A freeze placed this year on their use to treat gender dysphoria will remain in place for young people under 18, except in clinical trials, Britain’s government said. ByStephen Castle Reporting from London Britain is to ban indefinitely the use of puberty blockers for young people under 18 with gender dysphoria, except in clinical trials, the governmentsaidon Wednesday, making permanent a set of temporary restrictions put in place earlier this year. Announcing the decision, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said he was acting after having received advice from medical experts, who concluded that there was an unacceptable safety risk in prescribing puberty blockers without further research into their impact. “We need to act with caution and care when it comes to this vulnerable group of young people, and follow the expert advice,” Mr. Streeting said in astatement. He added: “We are setting up a clinical trial into the use of puberty blockers next year, to establish a clear evidence base for the use of this medicine.” The move, which the government said would apply across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, follows steps taken by the previous Conservative government to restrict the use of such drugs. The country’s National Health Service stopped the routine prescription of puberty blocker treatments to anyone under 18 as treatment for gender dysphoria following a landmark review into gender identity services undertaken byHilary Cass, one of the country’s top pediatricians. Her report, published in April, concluded that gender medicine was operating on “shaky foundations” when it came to the evidence for some medical treatments, including prescribing hormones to pause puberty or to change physical characteristics.

Mr. al-Bashir, who previously administered theHayat Tahrir al-Sham-led government in Idlib Province, is expected to lead until March 1, 2025. Some of the key difficulties will be to “maintain security, maintain the stability of institutions, and ensure that the state does not disintegrate,” Mr. al-Bashir said in a statement reported by Syria’s state news agency SANA on Wednesday, adding that the interim administration had “extensive experience” of governing in Idlib. Syria has been deeply divided by 13 years of civil war, and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has vowed to maintain security and continuity, aiming to avoid thekind of power vacuumthat has followed other Arab revolutions or regime changes. The group hastried to gain international legitimacywhile also being criticized for its authoritarian tactics and supports a conservative and at times hard-line Sunni Islamist ideology. Mr. al-Bashir was born in 1983 in Jabal al-Zawiya, Idlib province, according to a website of the rebel-led administration in Idlib. The area became infamous after security forces wereaccusedby human rights groups and others of a series of killings in 2011 soon after protests erupted against Mr. al-Assad’s rule. Mr. al-Bashir gained a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Aleppo in 2007 and in subsequent years attained additional qualifications in English, administrative planning and project management, according to awebsiteof the transitional government. In 2021, he also gained a degree in “Shariah and law” from Idlib University. His political evolution, and how he came to support rebels fighting to overthrow Mr. al-Assad’s government, was not immediately clear. The website for the transitional government also said that in 2011, the year the civil war began, Mr. al-Bashir held a management job at the state-owned Syrian Gas Company, part of the petroleum ministry. On Wednesday, thecompany’s websitestill featured a photograph showing Mr. al-Assad touring a facility. It is also not clear where Mr. al-Bashir was during the years that followed, or what role he may have played in the conflict, but by 2022, he had emerged as minister of development in the administrative arm of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which for years had held territory in Idlib. He was appointed prime minister for that territory this year, according to the group’s website, months before the rebel alliance began the assault that overthrew the Assad government.

Who Set the Stage for al-Assad’s Ouster? There Are Different Answers in the U.S. and Israel.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/al-assad-ouster-us-israel.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Supported by President Biden says he weakened Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, laying the groundwork for Bashar al-Assad’s ouster. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Syrian leader would still be in power had he listened to American advice. ByDavid E. Sanger David E. Sanger has covered five presidents for The Times and written extensively on superpower conflict. Bashar al-Assad had barely settled into his new quarters in Russia before the argument broke out over who can take the credit for ousting him, ending 53 years and two generations of brutal family rule over Syria. President Biden and his aides say they set the stage, because they worked relentlessly to weaken Syria’s main backers, including Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. There was a reason, Mr. Biden argued, that none of Mr. al-Assad’s allies were able or willing to come bail him out at the very moment he needed rescue. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his aides tell a very different story, saying the only reason Mr. al-Assad fell was that Israel killed the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, which Mr. Netanyahu called “a turning point in the collapse of the axis.” Israeli officials have been quick to note that Mr. Netanyahu ordered that attack over the objections of the Biden administration, which feared that going after Mr. Nasrallah would risk a wider war. And Mr. Netanyahu inserted the knife a bit himself, saying that the key was his decision to ignore pressure “to stop the war before we accomplished all of our goals.” His message was clear: Had he listened to Mr. Biden’s warnings about avoiding a “wider war,’’ Mr. al-Assad would most likely still be lounging in his palace this week. Sorting out the truth here is not easy, and historians of the Middle East will most likely be arguing for years over what factors were at play, not least the Syrian rebel force itself, which had crucial support from Turkey. Certainly, if there was an American contribution to Mr. al-Assad’s fall, it took a while: In August 2011, President Barack Obama said it was time for Mr. al-Assad to “step aside,” and two years later, on his first visit to Israel as president, he stood with Mr. Netanyahu and declared that Mr. al-Assad had lost all legitimacy and “must go.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Scholz Calls for Confidence Vote, in Step Toward German Elections",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/europe/germany-scholz-no-confidence-vote.html,"Advertisement Supported by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who had few alternatives after his three-party coalition broke up, is widely expected to lose when Parliament takes up the measure on Monday. ByChristopher F. Schuetze Reporting from Berlin Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany called for a confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday, taking the first formal step toward disbanding the German government and leading to snap elections likely to oust him from office. The move, culminating in a parliamentary vote on Monday, became all but necessary in November, when thechancellor fired his finance minister, precipitating the breakup of his fragile three-party coalition. “In a democracy, it is the voters who determine the course of future politics. When they go to the polls, they decide how we will answer the big questions that lie ahead of us,” Mr. Scholz said from the chancellery in Berlin on Wednesday. Mr. Scholz expects to lose the vote. The collapse of the government along with the early electionon Feb. 23amount to an extraordinary political moment in a country long known for stable governments. The political turbulence in Germany andthe fall last week of the government in Francehave left the European Union with avacuum of leadership at critical moment: It is facing challenges from Russia’s war in Ukraine and the imminent return to the presidency of Donald J. Trump in the United States. Mr. Trump has threatened a trade war with Europe and has consistently expressed skepticism about America’s commitment to the NATO alliance that has been the guarantor of security on the continent for 75 years.

Syria After al-Assad: How Will the Rebels Govern?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-assad-israel-turkey.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement Supported by After a rapid rise to power, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group is trying to unite a fractious country where fighting is ongoing. ByThe New York Times Ahmed al-Shara, the leader of the rebel group that ousted the Assad regime in Syria,said this weekendthat “Syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations.” But the rapid rise of Mr. al-Shara’s group to power has left many questions unanswered, especially how it might govern the fractious country. And there are many confrontations already in motion, including a violent conflict between Turkey-backed militias and Kurdish-led forces, and Israel’s ongoing airstrikes on Syrian military sites. Here’s a guide to understanding where things stand in Syria, and what may come next. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, whose name means Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, was the main rebel group leading the offensive thatquickly led to the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. The group is now leading the transition to a new Syrian government. Mohammed al-Bashir, a rebel leader affiliated with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has been named as caretaker prime minister until March. 1. Mr. al-Bashir previously served as the head of the administration in Idlib, a rebel-held territory in the northwest. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s track record theremay offer some cluesto how it will oversee a much larger territory. The group maintained a robust internal security force to confront other military factions and domestic critics, prompting regular protests against its authoritarian methods and harsh jail conditions.

"Blast in Afghanistan Kills a Taliban Leader, Khalil Haqqani",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/asia/afghanistan-explosion-taliban-minister.html,"Advertisement Supported by The government accused the Islamic State of being behind the attack, which struck at the heart of the Taliban’s power structure after years of essentially unchallenged dominance. ByLynsey ChutelSafiullah PadshahandYaqoob Akbary An explosion in Afghanistan’s capital on Wednesday killed a Taliban official who was a member of one of the country’s most powerful political families, government officials said. The death of the minister, Khalil ur Rahman Haqqani, was the highest-profile killing in Afghanistan since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of the country. It was a strike at the heart of the Taliban’s power structure after years of essentially unchallenged dominance, and comes at a moment of strife within the group. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. The government blamed an Islamic State affiliate known asISIS-K, which has been one of the few remaining antagonists to the Taliban. Mr. Haqqani, the minister of refugees and repatriation, was a senior member of the Haqqani Network, an influential faction within the Taliban. The United States and the United Nations have designated the Haqqani Network as a terrorist organization. His nephewSirajuddin Haqqani, the acting interior minister, has led efforts to reshape the Taliban’s global image. Since the Taliban’s new rise to power, the Haqqanis have appeared eager to reach out to the West for recognition — to little effect so far. That effort has at times also seemed at odds with the dictates of the Taliban’s supreme leader, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has issued a series of increasingly harsh edictsrestricting women’s rightsand freedoms in Afghanistan, which have been unpopular not only abroad but also at home.

How Many People Have Died in Syria’s Civil War?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/middleeast/syria-civil-war-death-toll.html,"Syria’sCivil War Advertisement The United Nations and human rights organizations have faced challenges in counting all those killed and missing in the conflict that began in March 2011. ByAryn Baker With the end of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, the task of tallying the cost in human lives of a nearly 14-year-long civil war is continuing. Death toll estimates from the conflict are as high as 620,000, a staggering number in a country with a prewar population of 22 million. Experts say establishing the true scale of death is complicated, as estimates are drawn from different sources and methods and calculated in varying ways. Here’s what we know: As of March, theSyrian Observatory for Human Rightshad documented the names of 507,567 people who had died in Syria since the outbreak of the conflict in March 2011. The independent Syrian-run organization, which is based in Britain and collates information from multiple sources, said that it had verified another 110,343 deaths of people who were not named, bringing the total of civilians and combatants killed throughout the war to 617,910. The Syrian Network for Human Rights, another independent human rights organization that has been tracking the toll since the start of the conflict, had counted a total of 231,495 civilian deaths through June. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights last released an accounting in 2021, when it estimated that at least 580,000 people had been killed to that point, including 350,209 “identified individuals.” The U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, cautioned at the time that the figure was “not a complete number of conflict-related killings” but that it indicated a “minimum verifiable number, and is certainly an undercount of the actual number.” Before 2021, the United Nations had not released a report on deaths in Syria since 2014 because it said conditions on the ground made accurate documentation impossible. However, when the war reached its 10th year, the organization responded to the need for updated information with a new report. By then, the war had shifted from large-scale military hostilities to regional clashes between multiple armed groups, making access and accuracy even more complicated, so the U.N. stopped reporting numbers. The U.N. and the Syrian human rights organizations say they rely on on-the-ground interviews, news reports and publicly available information such as death certificates and hospital records. They then identify and exclude duplicates and records with only partial information from the total and check the results against other statistical estimates.

Trump’s Admiration for Royals Could Make Them a Potent Diplomatic Tool,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/europe/trump-uk-royals-prince-william-king-charles.html,"TrumpTransition Advertisement Supported by A meeting between President-elect Donald J. Trump and Prince William showed Britain’s hope that the Windsors could help safeguard relations with Washington. ByMark Landler Reporting from London When President Donald J. Trumpvisited Britain in 2019, British officials arranged for him to have afternoon tea with Charles, then the Prince of Wales, at his London residence, Clarence House. The thinking among British diplomats was that the 70-something heir to the throne would be a good partner for the 70-something heir to a real estate fortune. It was not clear that Mr. Trump, now 78, and Charles, now 76, had much in common, beyond age and inherited wealth. But the British were on to something in trying to deepen the personal ties between Mr. Trump and the royal family. He already regarded Queen Elizabeth II, the king’s mother, with a reverence bordering on awe. His visit to Buckingham Palace ranked as one of the highlights of his first term. With the Trump restoration imminent and the British government now led by a left-of-center prime minister, Keir Starmer, who could find himself politically at odds with Mr. Trump, the crown may end up being a useful weapon in Britain’s campaign to keep the president-elect’s affections. On Saturday, Mr. Trump forged ties to the next generation, meeting Prince William, the 42-year-old son of King Charles III, after both attended the reopening ofNotre-Dame Cathedralin Paris. His comments afterward left little doubt that Mr. Trump savors his exposure to royals of any age. “I had a great talk with the prince,” Mr. Trump told The New York Post. “He’s a good-looking guy,” the president-elect went on. “He looked really, very handsome last night. Some people look better in person? He looked great. He looked really nice, and I told him that.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Prices have skyrocketed, but residents express some hope for the future. ByMuhammad Haj KadourandRaja Abdulrahim Muhammad Haj Kadour reported from Aleppo, Syria, and Raja Abdulrahim from Antakya, Turkey The rebels who are now Syria’s de facto rulers have started to make their mark on the country’s government. They took control of Aleppo just two weeks ago, but already police officers are in the streets sporting new uniforms, administrators are busy in the halls of government and there are posters on lampposts with QR codes directing people to updates on government policy. Gone are the ubiquitous photos of President Bashar al-Assad, whose visage, like that of his father before him, had dominated the city. The Assad regime controlled the country for decades, then crumbled in a matter of days. It has been replaced by an array of rebel factions led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group that hastried to gain international legitimacywhile also being criticized for its authoritarian tactics. The group, which has controlled most of the northwestern province of Idlib for years, supports a conservative and at times hard-line Sunni Islamist ideology. With all eyes on the rebels’ plans for the future,Aleppooffers early hints on how the group might approach governance — at least in the immediate future.

Sudanese soldiers drove through a destroyed market in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, in April.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York Times Supported by ByDeclan Walsh Reporting from Juba, South Sudan; Port Sudan, Sudan; Cairo; and Adré, Chad. The luxury jet touched down in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, on a mission to collect hundreds of pounds of illicit gold. On board was a representative of a ruthless paramilitary group accused of ethnic cleansing in Sudan’s sprawling civil war, the flight manifest showed. The gold itself had been smuggled from Darfur, a region of famine and fear in Sudan that is largely under his group’s brutal control. Porters grunted as they heaved cases filled with gold, about $25 million worth, onto the plane, said three people involved with or briefed on the deal. Airport officials discreetly maintained a perimeter around the jet, which stood out in the main airport of one of the world’s poorest countries. After 90 minutes, the jet took off again, landing before dawn on March 6 at a private airport in the United Arab Emirates, flight data showed. Its gleaming cargo soon vanished into the global gold market. As Sudan burns and its people starve, a gold rush is underway. War has shattered Sudan’s economy, collapsed its health system and turned much of the once-proud capital intopiles of rubble. Fighting has also set off one of the world’s worst famines in decades, with 26 million people facing acute hunger or starvation. But the gold trade is humming. The production and trade of gold, which lies in rich deposits across the vast nation, has actually surpassed prewar levels — and that’s just the official figure in a country rife with smuggling.

England and Wales drawn in same tough Euro 2025 group,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjwlnxydd45o,"Defending champions England and debutants Wales have been drawn in the same group for Euro 2025 in Switzerland, with France and the Netherlands joining them.The Lionesses were in pot two for the draw so were always going to face either hosts Switzerland or one of the other top teams. They avoided being in the same group as 2023 World Cup winners Spain or eight-time Euros winners Germany but still face a tough assignment before the knockout stage.England and Wales will meet in the final round of Group D fixtures on Sunday, 13 July in St Gallen.Sarina Wiegman's Lionesses are ranked fourth in the world, Wales are 30th, the Netherlands are 10th and France are 11th.The draw means Wiegman must face her native Netherlands, who she led to victory at Euro 2017 and a runner-up finish at the 2019 World Cup.Rhian Wilkinson's Walesbeat the Republic of Ireland 3-2 on aggregatein a play-off to reach their first major women's tournament.England booked their place by finishing as runners-up in their qualification group, behind France.The 16-team European Championship takes place across eight venues in Switzerland from 2-27 July.Prize money has more than doubled for the tournament, with the total pot now standing at Â£34m (41m euros), a 156% increase from Euro 2022.

US players to be paid Â£400k for playing in Ryder Cup,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/clyg859jed5o,"Players on next year's United States Ryder Cup team will be paid to compete after a package was agreed by the PGA of America.It will be the first time in the 98-year history of the matches that either side has been paid to play.The 12 players will each receive $500,000 (Â£400,000), with $300,000 (Â£240,000) donated to a charity or charities chosen by each member of the team.The PGA of America, which organises the event, approved the package despite saying ""no players asked to be compensated"".Six players will qualify automatically via the US Ryder Cup points list and captain Keegan Bradley will make six wildcard selections.""The players and captains, past and present, are responsible for the Ryder Cup becoming the most special competition in golf and one of the most in-demand events on the international sports scene,"" the PGA of America said in a statement.Last year's contest in Rome was marked by Patrick Cantlay not wearing the American team cap in what wasreported to be a protest,externalat the fact the players were not being remunerated to compete.Europe's Rory McIlroy said last month he would pay to play in the matches, which will be held at Bethpage in New York.""I personally would pay for the privilege to play on the Ryder Cup,""McIlroy told BBC Sport.""The two purest forms of competition in our game right now are the Ryder Cup and the Olympics, and it's partly because of that, the purity of no money being involved."" Europe won the 2023 Ryder Cupin Rome, where Cantlay's cap stance led to home fans removing their headwear as he approached in an attempt to taunt the American.It ultimately led to a spat between McIlroy and Cantlay's caddie Joe LaCava, who waved his cap close to the Northern Irishman as he lined up a putt after his player had holed a long effort on the 18th in a match against the four-time major champion and Matt Fitzpatrick.That episode spilled into angry scenes in the car park at Marco Simone afterwards, which McIlroy and captain Luke Donald said fired up Europe for Sunday's singles.""I don't think any of the 24 players on either team needs 400 grand,"" McIlroy said.""Every two years, there are 104 weeks and 103 weeks you can play golf and get paid.""Europe, who have not won on American soil since 2012, will again be captained in 2025 by Donald.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Does sacking a manager help you avoid relegation?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0kv7ym5k2vo,"Two of the clubs in the Premier League decided to roll the dice on Sunday by sacking their managers.Southampton, nine points adrift and bottom, axed Russell Martin - the manager who got them promoted last season.Wolves, five points off safety, sacked Gary O'Neil after a season and a half in charge.But does sacking a manager help to bring about survival when a team are in the relegation zone? Not counting this season, there have been 91 times when a team have parted company with their manager while in the drop zone - and on 36 of those occasions they avoided relegation.That is a success rate of 40%, so we know the difficult decision can work.Of those 36 cases, five of the teams were exactly five points adrift when the manager left, like Wolves.Sam Allardyce kept up two of those five teams - Blackburn in 2008-09 and Sunderland in 2015-16.Tony Parkes, as a caretaker, saved Blackburn from such a perilous position in 1996-97, while Harry Redknapp saw Tottenham to safety in 2008-09.Tony Pulis helped Crystal Palace avoid the drop in 2013-14, although by the time he took over from caretaker Keith Millen they were only three points off safety.Only one of those five instances happened this late in a season, though - when Blackburn sacked Paul Ince on 16 December 2008 and hired Allardyce two days later.The other four changes with teams five points adrift all happened in October.One good omen for Wolves is that they were the second most recent team who changed managers while in the bottom three and stayed up.That was when Julen Lopetegui replaced Bruno Lage - via Steve Davis' caretaker spell - just before the 2022 World Cup. Um...No team have ever had a change of manager when nine points adrift (or anything more than five points) and stayed up.In fact, only two teams have ever stayed up after being nine points or more from safety at any stage of the season.They are Blackburn in 1996-97 - a week or so after Parkes replaced Ray Harford - and West Ham in 2006-07.The Hammers, who replaced Alan Pardew with Alan Curbishley earlier that season, were 10 points adrift with nine games to go - but they won seven of those to stay up.Changing manager while in the drop zone has worked for Southampton three times - when Ian Branfoot left in 1993-94, Stuart Gray left in 2001-02 and Mark Hughes exited in 2018-19.But the tactic failed for them twice in 2022-23 when first Ralph Hasenhuttl in November and then Nathan Jones in February left.But in none of those instances were they in this big of a mess.We also now know Southampton will be bottom of the table at Christmas - with only four previous teams having survived from that position in Premier League history.West Bromwich Albion (2004-05), Sunderland (2013-14), Leicester (2014-15) and Wolves (2022-23) are the four sides to manage it. Looking more recently - in the five seasons previous to this campaign, 16 teams parted company with their manager while in the relegation zone. Only five of them stayed up.Last season the same three teams spent most of the season in the bottom three - Burnley, Luton and Sheffield United.The Blades changed manager but the other two did not - and they all went down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UK Sport invests record Â£330m for 2028 LA Games,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cjr2lgj0x31o,"Elite sport funding body UK Sport says it will invest a record Â£330m in Britain's Olympic and Paralympic sports for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.More than 50 sports will benefit, though athletics has had its budget reduced for the second cycle running.Five new sports for the 2028 Games - baseball/softball, flag football, lacrosse, Para-climbing and squash - have all received funding.Breaking, which featured for the first time at the Paris Games this summer, is no longer eligible for support after it was axed from the Olympic programme.The total figure will top Â£400m with the addition of athlete performance awards (APAs), which are paid directly to individual athletes and contribute to their living and sporting costs so they can focus on competing - about Â£70m was awarded in APAs in the Paris funding cycle, which totalled Â£385m.Sally Munday, chief executive officer of UK Sport, told BBC Sport funding should not be looked at as either a ""reward"" or a ""punishment"" for performances at the Paris Games.""The decision that we've made against all the sports is we've looked at their potential,"" said Munday.""UK Athletics will receive in excess of Â£30m for the Olympic and Paralympic programmes and we believe that's going to put them in a great place to support their athletes in the lead into LA.""Jack Buckner, CEO of UK Athletics, said the organisation was ""disappointed"" with the decision to reduce the sport's share by Â£1.725m, and highlighted the 10 medals at both the World Championships in 2023 and this year's Olympics ""deserved a higher level of investment"".Canoeing was another sport to have its funding cut, by more than Â£500,000. When the total funding for the Paris 2024 cycle is taken into account, modern pentathlon and equestrian have received a smaller budget, but rowing has increased to Â£24.85m from Â£22.72m, despite a cut between Tokyo and Paris.Meanwhile, British Basketball Federation chair Chris Grant said the sport ""has entered a new era"" with an award of Â£2.925m, primarily to help develop the 3x3 format of the game.Great Britain won 65 medals at this year's Games and 124 medals at the Paralympics.They finished seventh in the Olympic medal table, behind the Netherlands in sixth and fifth-placed France, but Munday said the aim is to be ""consistently top five"".""We'll be really forensic - were there contributing factors that we could do differently to make sure that we don't find ourselves in that position again?"" said Munday.""We will be leaving no stone unturned to make sure that we've really understood what the factors are as to why we came seventh. But we're very clear we want to be consistently top five.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stokes blow compounds England slide towards defeat,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cdxzlr1790xo,"Third Test, Hamilton (day three of five)New Zealand 347(Santner 76; Potts 4-90)& 453(Williamson 156, Young 60, Mitchell 60)England 143(Henry 4-48, Santner 3-7, O'Rourke 3-33)& 18-2England need 640 runs to winScorecard England's slide towards a massive defeat in the third Test against New Zealand was compounded by a concerning recurrence of Ben Stokes' hamstring injury.Stokes was in visible distress as he left the field clutching the same left hamstring he injured in August, subsequently missing four Tests.The captain was bowling his third over of the third day, midway through the afternoon session. He pulled up in the follow-through of his second delivery, went straight to the dressing room and did not return for the remainder of the New Zealand second innings. The all-rounder will have a scan overnight.Even before Stokes was injured, England were staring down the barrel as an inevitable Kane Williamson century built New Zealand's monstrous lead.After rain delayed play by two and a half hours, Williamson moved to 156. He added 107 with Rachin Ravindra, who made 44, and another 92 with Daryl Mitchell, who helped himself to 60.When New Zealand were finally bowled out for 453, England's target was a world-record and improbable 658.England were left six overs to bat, in which time Ben Duckett played an awful hack to drag on off the retiring Tim Southee and Zak Crawley was lbw to his tormentor Matt Henry.The tourists will resume on 18-2 when play gets under way at the earlier time of 10:30 (21:30 GMT Monday) on day four.Dry weather is forecast for days four and five, giving New Zealand plenty of time to salvage a consolation victory from a series England have already won.For England, the bigger worry is Stokes' fitness. This is a devastating blow for Stokes, whose progress from left-knee surgery at the end of last year has now been hit by two hamstring injuries in the space of five months.The first, sustained playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred, ruled him out of the home series against Sri Lanka and first Test in Pakistan. Stokes later admitted the mental toll the battle to get fit in Pakistan took on him, made worse by a break-in at his home while he was away.The captain has looked near to his best in New Zealand, the country of his birth, both as a leader and a player.The 33-year-old had been able to play a full role as a fourth seamer, but it is the repeat injury after such a bowling workload that is the cause for alarm.The 23 overs he bowled on the first day of this Test are the most he has bowled in a single day, his 36.2 overs in the match his most since June 2022 and the 66.1 overs in the series his most as captain.Stokes pulled up with a back problem during the first Test in Christchurch, though was able to stay on the field. His immediate reaction here was an instant indication of the severity of the issue.As Ravindra hoiked to mid-on, Stokes hobbled off, covering his face as he left. Ollie Pope, already standing-in as wicketkeeper, took over as captain.Stokes had treatment and will be assessed further before England make a decision on whether he bats in the second innings.His spell with MI Cape Town in the SA T20 in January will surely be cancelled and any slim prospect of a return to the England one-day team for the Champions Trophy is over. More important are the questions over his long-term prospects as a Test bowler. When New Zealand resumed on 136-3, leading by 340, England's prospects were already bleak and Williamson mercilessly removed any semblance of hope.On his home ground, Williamson racked up his seventh century and nudged his average at Seddon Park to 94.94. From 50 overnight, he was watchful and correct, mainly waiting for England to drop short in order to cut to the square boundary.On 73, Williamson survived the tightest lbw shout from Brydon Carse and on 80 miscued Shoaib Bashir over Carse at mid-wicket. On 86, a pull at a Stokes bouncer was parried by Pope flying down the leg side. It would have been a magnificent catch.When Stokes was injured he was replaced in the attack by left-arm spinner Jacob Bethell, whom Williamson hit for six over long-on to go to his 33rd Test hundred. The action simply became about how many runs New Zealand wanted to amass.Williamson seemed nailed for a double, only to sweep Bashir to sub fielder Rehan Ahmed at deep square leg. Mitchell holed out to long-off to become Bethell's first Test wicket.The futility of New Zealand continuing to grow their lead bordered on farce. England spared their seamers and Harry Brook bowled with the second new ball.The crowd chanted for Southee and got their wish after Mitchell Santner was out for 49, including five sixes. England gave Southee his second guard of honour of the match, his quest to add to his 98 career sixes ended by lofting Bethell to long-on. Next ball, Bethell bowled Henry to end with 3-72.Zak Crawley overturned being given out leg before to Henry from the fifth ball of the innings, before Duckett's ridiculous charge at Southee.There was still time for Henry to get Crawley for the sixth time in six innings in the series. Crawley ends with a series average of 8.66 â no England opener has ever batted as much in a single series and ended with a lower average.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Austria striker's skull is fractured during attack,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpvnjp4p407o,"Austria striker Guido Burgstaller had his skull fractured when he was attacked in the centre of the country's capital city, his club Rapid Vienna have said.Rapid said the 35-year-old is expected to be out of action for several months after suffering the ""serious head injury"" at the weekend.They say the former Cardiff City forward was attacked by an ""unknown man"" and fractured his skull as he fell following a ""brutal blow"".The 35-year-old, capped 26 times by Austria, was examined at the scene before being taken to hospital, where he will remain for the next few days.In a statement, Rapid said they ""trust in the responsible authorities that the as-yet-unknown perpetrator will be brought to justice quickly"".Burgstaller joined Cardiff from Rapid in 2014, becoming Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's second signing for the Welsh club.He made just three appearances for the Bluebirds before joining German club Nurnberg.Burgstaller also played in Germany for Schalke and St Pauli before returning to Rapid in 2022.He was one of three Austria players dropped by manager Ralf Rangnick in 2023 after they were filmed singing homophobic chants following a 3-0 win against city rivals Austria Vienna.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allen stars in Bills epic & Mahomes limps out of Chiefs win,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/c70ex875l27o,"Josh Allen produced another sensational display in another Buffalo Bills epic on Sunday, while the Kansas City Chiefs' latest victory may have come at a huge cost.The defending champions enjoyed their biggest win of the season but saw star quarterback Patrick Mahomes limp out of the game with a worrying ankle injury.Buffalo have no such worries over their own superstar Allen, who again showed why he is the Most Valuable Player favourite as the Bills ended the Detroit Lions' 11-game winning run in another high-scoring thriller.The Pittsburgh Steelers lost at the Philadelphia Eagles but still secured their spot in the play-offs, as did the Houston Texans, while the Minnesota Vikings joined them without even playing. Just a week after losing 44-42 at the Rams, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills came out on top this time in another blockbuster - edging the Lions 48-42 in Detroit.Billed as a potential Super Bowl preview, the top two scorers in the NFL put on a show worthy of the big game, with their two banged-up defences unable to shackle Allen or Lions quarterback Jared Goff.Goff threw five touchdowns but was always playing from behind after Allen's two quick rushing scores early on - as the Bills equalled an NFL record with eight straight games scoring 30 points or more.They are also just the second team to score and concede 40 points in back-to-back games.If this fixture is repeated in the Super Bowl it would be some spectacle, but both sides need to solve some defensive issues if they are to make it to New Orleans in February. The 11-3 Bills are the only team to beat the 13-1 Chiefs and will now fancy pipping them to the AFC top seed after the champions saw Mahomes limp out late in their 21-7 victory at the Cleveland Browns.The Chiefs have won 10 games this season by one score - six of those coming on the final play of the game - so this was their most comfortable victory of the campaign.""I feel like I could have finished the game in different circumstances,"" Mahomes said after the Chiefs opted to send back-up Carson Wentz in to finish the game.Head coach Andy Reid confirmed Mahomes' ankle was not broken, but the timing is tough with the Chiefs playing on Saturday, 21 December against Houston and then in a Christmas Day visit to Pittsburgh.With home advantage and a crucial bye week at stake in their race with the Bills, there will be a lot riding on further medical tests on Mahomes' ankle on Monday. The Pittsburgh Steelers have now lost 11 straight games in Philadelphia as the Eagles won the latest battle for Pennsylvania 27-13 - and a team record 10th straight victory of the season.Jalen Hurts finally got the Eagles' passing attack moving a week after receivers AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith's public criticism, with opposition quarterback Russell Wilson having all the production problems this week.The Steelers did secure a play-off place despite the defeat, but their top spot in the AFC North is under threat after the Baltimore Ravens dominated the New York Giants 35-14 to close the gap.Lamar Jackson threw five touchdown passes before next week's huge showdown against the Steelers in Baltimore - with Pittsburgh also sweating over defensive star TJ Watt who injured his ankle against the Eagles.The Houston Texans won a second straight AFC South title after beating the Dolphins 20-12 - in a game overshadowed by a serious injury to Miami receiver Grant DuBose, who was driven off on a stretcher in a neck brace after 10 minutes of treatment following a blow to the head.Head coach Mike McDaniel said DuBose would remain in hospital overnight after ""some positive feedback"" on his head and neck injuries. Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers impressed with a comprehensive 30-13 win in Seattle, which saw the Seahawks lose top spot in the NFC West and drop out of the play-off places altogether.At 10-4, only five teams in the entire NFL have a better record than the Packers, but two of those are in Green Bay's division - so a wildcard looks their most likely route to the play-offs.The Packers helped one of their rivals out, with the Minnesota Vikings bagging a play-off spot before their Monday night game thanks to Seattle losing.The divisional system is helping out the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who improved to just 8-6 with a 40-17 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers and that is good enough to top the weaker NFC South. The Washington Commanders led 20-7 in the fourth quarter but had to survive a late onslaught at the New Orleans Saints, with back-up quarterback Spencer Rattler throwing a touchdown pass as time expired.Trailing by a point, interim head coach Darren Rizzi went for a two-point conversion and instant win instead of settling for overtime, but the try just failed, allowing Washington to escape 20-19.Indianapolis Colts running back Jonathan Taylor was left red faced when he casually dropped the ball after scoring a touchdown - only for a video replay to spot he did so just inches before the line.That cost the Colts dearly as they went on to lose 31-13 at the Denver Broncos.Joe Burrow threw another three touchdown passes as the Cincinnati Bengals beat the Tennessee Titans 37-27 in a game filled with mistakes.The two teams combined for 10 turnovers and 26 penalties in a coach's nightmare of a game.Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams rolled back the years as the New York Jets beat the slumping Jacksonville Jaguars 32-25 - with Adams becoming the 12th player with 100 receiving touchdowns in NFL history.The Jets are already out of play-off contention but Rodgers and Adams gave a glimpse of what they could possibly do next season if both stay with the team.Micah Parsons inspired the Dallas Cowboys to a comfortable win at the Carolina Panthers and the Arizona Cardinals ended a three-game losing run by beating the New England Patriots.

England take control of Test after South Africa collapse,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cvg68jl0rd4o,"South Africa v England, one-off Test (day two of four)England 395-9 dec & 31-1 (14 overs):Knight 19; Hlubi 1-1South Africa 281 (88.4 overs):Wolvaardt 65; Bell 4-49England lead by 145 runsScorecard England took control of the one-off Test against South Africa as the hosts lost their last seven first-innings wickets for 44 runs in a dramatic evening session.The Proteas' top order battled to reach 237-3 in Bloemfontein, before a delay for lightning after tea coincided with a change of course in the game.England's seamers pounced with the new ball under darkening skies to dismiss South Africa for 281 and take a 114-run lead.That advantage was extended to 145 as Tammy Beaumont and Heather Knight steered England to 31-1 at the close, after first-innings centurion Maia Bouchier fell for a duck.South Africa earlier appeared on course to reach parity through Marizanne Kapp, who made a fluent 57 before she was bowled by debutant Ryana MacDonald-Gay which sparked the collapse as the delay came just five balls later.MacDonald-Gay struck again shortly after the resumption with Nadine de Klerk caught behind for a duck, Lauren Filer ended Sune Luus' resistance for a gritty 56 and Chloe Tryon tamely chipped Lauren Bell to mid-on for 20.Bell finished with 4-49 after mopping up the tail, with the collapse distracting from the disciplined efforts of South Africa's top order throughout the morning and afternoon sessions.Opener Anneke Bosch fell in the second over of the day, but a stand of 92 between Laura Wolvaardt and Annerie Dercksen helped the hosts rebuild until the latter was caught at slip off Filer from the final ball before lunch.The omission of the decision review system (DRS) for the match had a huge impact on the home side as captain Wolvaardt was visibly frustrated to be given out lbw to Sophie Ecclestone for 65, suggesting she had hit the ball.A chanceless partnership of 99 between Kapp and Luus followed but, once broken, a fragile middle to lower order was exposed and gave England hope of a first Test win since 2014. There was some concern that Kate Cross' omission from England's XI because of a back spasm could leave the seam attack short of control, but Bell and Filer stepped up with impressive maturity despite South Africa's gutsy partnerships for the second and fourth wickets.At times, Filer sacrificed accuracy as a result of her raw pace, but that point of difference proved invaluable on a docile pitch.The impressive Dercksen withstood the pressure after England's early breakthrough and dug in alongside her captain, and though both batters were tested by Filer's short ball in her fiery opening spell, they were mostly untroubled.But Knight threw Filer the ball for a short burst before lunch and it produced the desired result, with Dercksen fending off a short ball to slip where Ecclestone took a cracking one-handed rebound catch.While Luus and Kapp's partnership after lunch was solid, South Africa are not blessed with the same batting depth as England and it always felt as if one wicket would change the direction of the Test.MacDonald-Gay took out Kapp's off stump with a beauty as reward for her disciplined spell and then the lower order was blown away by Bell, with the tail backing away as England moved into the ascendancy. While the seamers played starring roles, wicketkeeper Amy Jones and left-arm spinner Ecclestone also proved crucial. They ensured that South Africa's top order, despite batting well, were unable to be ruthless in the manner of Bouchier and Nat Sciver-Brunt for England on day one.Ecclestone may have got a touch fortunate with the wicket of Wolvaardt if she did get an edge, but that moment followed a spell of remarkable consistency that gave the batter so few options to score and put the pressure back on.Wolvaardt seemed happy to defend Ecclestone and score from the other end, but she could only defy the spinner's greatness for so long, getting stuck on the crease by one defensive prod too many.The result was a furious Wolvaardt thumping her helmet with her bat as she marched off in disbelief, and while that was Ecclestone's only scalp, she twirled away for 25 overs and conceded just 40, which allowed captain Knight to rotate her seamers regularly and ensure they were all well rested between spells.Meanwhile, Jones' ability to stand up to the medium-pacers set up the prized wicket of Kapp, who also found herself stuck in the crease and unable to manipulate the ball as effectively as she had against Bell and Filer.Kapp became frustrated and lost her off stump, while De Klerk also fell victim to the same trap as she got an edge through to Jones for a sharp catch.Luus had previously dropped anchor as Kapp was more aggressive, but following the wickets she looked uncertain about whether to continue with the approach or try to increase her strike rate when batting with the tail, eventually falling to the new ball by edging Filer behind after a 148-ball stay.The pitch is showing signs of deteriorating and Beaumont and Knight had to negotiate some uneven bounce at the end of the day.England's healthy lead puts them in a commanding position, though a forecast for wet weather on day four could force them to move the game along at a quicker rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wade beaten by Wattimena at World Championship,https://www.bbc.com/sport/darts/articles/c938ke294lno,"Former world number two James Wade has been knocked out in the second round of the PDC World Darts Championship by Jermaine Wattimena.Wade, a former Premier League, World Matchplay and World Grand Prix champion, lost 3-0 to Wattimena in the final match of Monday's afternoon session at Alexandra Palace.Englishman Wade, a four-time semi-finalist, is the first seeded player to be eliminated from the competition, receiving a bye to round two and entering as the 16th seed.Wattimena, 36, will face either two-time world champion Peter Wright or Wesley Plaisier in the third round.The Dutchman was the first player to have played in both days of this year's World Championship after beating Swiss debutant Stefan Bellmont 3-0 on Sunday night.Having lost the opening leg to Wade, Wattimena reeled off eight straight legs to win the first two sets and move within one leg of a second-round victory.Wade hit double 20 to avoid a whitewash in the final set, but Wattimena took advantage of Wade's missed doubles to seal the win.Wattimena averaged 99.17 in the match, with Wade on 97.01.Monday's evening session includes 2021 world champion Gerwyn Price taking on Irishman Keane Barry in the second round.There will be live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app from 18:45 GMT.

PGA Tour v LIV - why 'The Showdown' is significant,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c1el0y158g8o,"A supposed peace deadline had just passed and men's professional golf was mired in more uncertainty, when the idea to create a match between PGA Tour players and those from the breakaway LIV circuit was first pitched.The initial approach, by TV producer Bryan Zuriff, was made to the Rory McIlroy camp in Dubai last January. Zuriff was responsible for previous iterations of 'The Match' - televised silly season clashes for cash.But this concept seemed to carry more significance. McIlroy certainly saw it that way as did three of his most notable peers, which is why 'The Showdown' comes to fruition in Las Vegas on Tuesday.McIlroy partners world number one Scottie Scheffler against LIV recruits Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka in an 18-hole Ryder Cup-style matchplay event. For once, this is a confected contest tasty enough to be worth watching. PGA versus LIV - the establishment against the upstarts and McIlroy against DeChambeau - the man who capitalised on the Northern Irish star's US Open capitulation last June.Scheffler competes fresh from reminding us of his prowess with victory in the Bahamas last week, while DeChambeau and 2023 US PGA Championship winner Koepka are past sworn enemies now united as the only players to land majors while playing under the LIV umbrella.These are attractive storylines and this is the first time since The Open in high summer that this quartet of superstars have all been able to play in the same event.If you wanted to put on a match, these are the four players you would want, which is telling, because professional golf remains a fractured, split sport. But this week's competition is the vehicle to demonstrate that some of the biggest names have had enough of an increasingly tedious and debilitating divide.Last week McIlroy was asked whether this event would serve as a detrimental reminder that men's professional golf is still a sport at war. The world number three thought it was ""a terrible question"", but it did yield an interesting response.""We're trying to bring these players together, and the more opportunities we can get to do that, the better,"" McIlroy said.""Does it remind people we're not playing together all the time? Yes. But at least we're making the effort to try to bring the best together more often. If we can start by doing something like this, that's only a good thing.""He is saying, in other words, that the stars are taking this into their own hands to make an influential push to end the stalemate. This is another example of how the power of leading players has increased while rival factions have been battling for the game's future.Scheffler weighed in by saying: ""There's been so much talk about LIV versus the PGA Tour, all this talk about money. We want to get back to the competition. It's fun to get together to compete.""It is fair to say the PGA Tour was lukewarm about two of its most prominent members' involvement in competing against a pair of LIV stars, who remain suspended from the tour for joining the Saudi Arabia funded league.Significantly this match occurs in a week when there is no conflicting PGA Tour tournament. ""It took a few conversations to get them to the point where they saw that this could be a good thing in the long run,"" McIlroy admitted.""It wasn't all plain sailing, but we got there in the end.""PGA Tour boss Jay Monahan and his board continue negotiations with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) over a reported acquisition of six percent of the tour's commercial arm by the PIF.This is the deal that is now almost a year past its initial deadline, but it could still herald peace in golf's so called 'civil war'.If Saudi Arabia becomes formally invested in both sides, LIV and PGA Tour players being reunited at tournaments beyond the majors is a more likely scenario.But until a contract is signed and receives US government approval, we have only a handful of DP World Tour events where LIV recruits have been welcomed and this week's 'Showdown' at Shadow Creek as opportunities to see together golfers from the conflicted constituencies.The players will be mic'd up, but the golf should do the talking because there are enough ingredients to give the contest a degree of edge which has been missing from previous iterations.Genuine interaction between the players will be fascinating to hear. We do not need faux banter that can so often infect this kind of occasion and hopefully the players will remember they are golfers rather than comedians.It is no joke to say that this is possibly a glance into the future and not just because the spoils are coming in the form of Crypto currency. The LIV camp is already talking up an enticing prospect of a Ryder Cup style match between the rival tours.It is a concept that could excite fans and maybe replace the moribund Presidents Cup put on in non-Ryder years by the PGA Tour, which is contested by teams representing the US and non-European internationals and is not open to LIV golfers.Such developments in pro golf do not tend to happen in a hurry, though. Nevertheless, the fact that this week's contest is occurring at all is a start.And through its relative competitive validity it is, maybe, a significant step towards some kind of reconciliation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amazon aware of warehouse injury risk, report findsThe e-commerce giant is accused of trying to misrepresent its safety record, but says a report ""isn't grounded in reality"".1 hr agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyjm507462o,"Amazon pushes its US warehouse workers to fulfill orders at speeds that could cause high rates of injury despite being aware of the risks, an investigation led by Senator Bernie Sanders has found.Thefindings, following an 18-month probe of the firm, support claims that workers and labour campaigners have made about the company for years.The report accused the firm of rejecting changes that would have reduced workers' pace, but improved safety because of concerns about its bottom line.But Amazonsaidthe report was ""wrong on the facts"", and featured ""selective, outdated information that lacks context and isn't grounded in reality"". ""This investigation wasn't a fact-finding mission, but rather an attempt to collect information and twist it to support a false narrative,"" the company said.Amazon, which employs roughly 800,000 people in the US, has faced accusations about unsafe conditions at its warehouses for years.Those concerns ramped up during the Covid pandemic, when e-commerce exploded, leading to protests by its workers around the world.Amid the controversy, founder Jeff Bezos said the company needed to do better by its employees.Senator Sanders, who is known for his pro-worker stance,launched an investigation into Amazon's practices in June 2023.Senate staffers conducted 135 interviews and reviewed more than 1,000 documents.Their analysis of public records found that warehouses operated by Amazon recorded over 30% more injuries than the warehousing industry average in 2023.Amazon workers were also nearly twice as likely to be injured than people working in warehouses operated by other companies in each of the last seven years, according to the report, which was signed off by Democratic members of the Senate's Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Amazon had internally examined connections between workplace speed and injury rates, including in a review called Project Soteria, according to the investigation.But the report said the company opted not to adopt the recommended changes, which included providing more time off to workers, and halting disciplinary action against people who did not meet working speed requirements.Investigators also accused Amazon of trying to ""manipulate"" data to mislead the public about its safety record.Amazon said it was fair for the firm to focus safety comparisons on larger warehouses.It accused the Senate investigation of ignoring inconvenient facts, such as a decline in its injury rates and a recent court victory, which dismissed safety complaints.It said another team asked to review the recommendations of Amazon's internal safety study had found that the methodology was ""unsound"".""Nothing"" is more important to the firm than employee safety, Amazon said.""Sen.

""The Bitcoin rally since the election has been parabolic and the FOMO - or fear of missing out - rally is gathering momentum,"" Peter McGuire from trading platform XM.com told the BBC.""Many investors believe $120,000 is achievable by the end of the year and then in 2025 there's talk of greater than $150,000 by mid-year"".Earlier this month, Trump named Silicon Valley entrepreneur David Sacks as his artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency tsar.Mr Sacks is a former PayPal executive and a close friend of Trump adviser and mega-donor Elon Musk. Trump has also said he would nominate pro-cryptocurrency Washington attorney Paul Atkins as the new head of the Wall Street regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Last month,the SEC's current head, Gary Gensler, said he would resign from the roleon the day of Trump's inauguration, on 20 January next year.""I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility.

"Trump gets $15m in ABC News defamation caseThe network also publishes a statement expressing ""regret"" for statements by George Stephanopoulos.1 day agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrw57q4y9do,"ABC News has agreed to pay $15m (£12m) to US President-elect Donald Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit after its star anchor falsely said he had been found ""liable for rape"".George Stephanopoulos made the statements repeatedly during an interview on 10 March this year while challenging a congresswoman about her support for Trump.A jury in a civil caselast year determinedTrump was liable for ""sexual abuse"", which has a specific definition under New York law.As part of Saturday's settlement, first reported by Fox News Digital, ABC alsopublished an editor's noteexpressing its ""regret"" for the statements by Stephanopoulos. According to the settlement, ABC News will pay $15m as a charitable contribution to a ""Presidential foundation and museum to be established by or for Plaintiff, as Presidents of the United States of America have established in the past"".The $15m will go towards Trump's future presidential library, US media reported.The network also agreed to pay $1m towards Trump's legal fees.Under the settlement, the network will post an editor's note to the bottom of its 10 March 2024 online news article about the story.It will say: ""ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC's This Week on March 10, 2024.""An ABC News spokesperson said in a statement the company was ""pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing"".In 2023, a New York civil court found Trump sexually abused E Jean Carroll in a dressing room at a department store in 1996. He was also found guilty of defaming the magazine columnist.Judge Lewis Kaplan said the jury's conclusion was that Ms Carroll had failed to prove that Trump raped her ""within the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law"".Judge Kaplan noted that the definition of rape was ""far narrower"" than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries and in criminal statutes elsewhere.In a separate case, also presided over by the same judge, a jury ordered Trump to pay $83.3m to Ms Carroll for additional defamatory statements.Trump is appealing against both verdicts. During the 10 March broadcast, Stephanopoulos asked South Carolina Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace how she could endorse Trump.The anchor falsely said ""judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape"".Stephanopoulos repeated the claim 10 times throughout the broadcast.Ahead of the ruling, a federal magistrate judge had ordered Trump and Stephanopoulos to give sworn evidence at depositions next week.Trump has also sued CBS, the BBC's US broadcast partner, for ""deceptive conduct"" over an interview with Kamala Harris.In 2023,a judge threw out his defamation lawsuitagainst CNN, in which he alleged the network had likened him to Adolf Hitler.He has also had lawsuits filed against the New York Times and the Washington Post dismissed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Founder of fashion chain Mango dies in cave accidentThe 71-year-old is remembered for his fashion leadership after the accident in caves near Barcelona.2 days agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wed2egp4vo,"Isak Andic, the billionaire founder of high street fashion chain Mango, died in an accident on Saturday while exploring caves near Barcelona.Spanish media reported the 71-year-old fell down a ravine to his death while hiking in caves that are part of a mountain range.Andic was with his son and other family members when he fell, according to the El Pais newspaper, triggering a large emergency response.The Turkish-born businessman founded Mangowith the help of his brother, Nahman,in Barcelona in 1984 and the chain now operates almost 3,000 outlets in 120 countries. Forbes estimated Andic's net worth to be $4.5bn (£3.6bn). Andic reportedly fell down a 150-metre ravine while hiking in an area of the Montserrat mountains known for its deep caves.Police were called at around 13:00 local time (12:00 GMT), and a helicopter and specialised mountain unit was sent to the scene, El Pais reported.Mango CEO Toni Ruiz said in a statement: ""His departure leaves a huge void but all of us are, in some way, his legacy and the testimony of his achievements.""It is up to us, and this is the best tribute we can make to Isak and which we will fulfil, to ensure that Mango continues to be the project that Isak aspired to and of which he would feel proud.""Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez confirmed Andic died in an accident at the Salnitre de Collbató caves.""All my love and recognition for your great work and business vision, which has turned this Spanish firm into a world leader in fashion,"" Sanchez said. The president of Catalonia's government, Salvador Illa Roca, said he was ""dismayed by the loss"" and described Andic as a ""committed businessman"" who ""contributed to making Catalonia great and projecting it to the world"".Andic moved to north-eastern Spain's Catalonia region in the 1960s with his family and was a non-executive chairman of the company when he died. Mango had a turnover of €3.1bn (£2.6bn) in 2023.He was seen as having a rivalry with Zara founder Amancio Ortega, another Spanish fashion billionaire.The brand's popularity in the UK was boosted in 2011 when British model Kate Moss was announced as the face of Mango.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In from the cold: Scandi wines hope to win over drinkersThanks to climate change and tougher vines, Denmark and Sweden have a growing number of wineries.19 hrs agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27w5q315ro,"Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, andeven Norway,as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.""People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,"" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrhøj Vingård.Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and rosé.""We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,"" she explains. For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrhøj Vingård. ""There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,"" he chuckles. ""People like it.""The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. ""We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,"" says Mr Fink. Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.Curiosity, and the fact ""it's possible"", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.""I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,"" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.""I began with 500 vines,"" said Jean Becker, ""Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.""But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain. In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.""It is very challenging because it's new for us,"" he says. ""We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.""Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almosttwo degrees celsiusover the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and alonger fruit-growing season.But there remains a risk of frost damage.Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. ""We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.""But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. ""Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere."" However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. ""Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.""He is leading a programme called ""FastGrapes"", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.""There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,"" says the researcher. ""Part of that search happens in the lab… you can see the genes that make it strong.""The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium. But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bjäre peninsula. ""We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],"" he says.But ''starting from scratch"" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. ""It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.""Thora's owner, American expat Heather Öberg says all the effort and expense is worth it. ""We can compete with other European wines,"" she says.Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; £22) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.""We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,"" says Mr Becker. At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.""If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,"" he jokes.However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. ""The Danish wine is still too expensive,"" he says. ""It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.""

Christmas dinner in the UK set to cost less this yearThe BBC digs into which bits of the festive feast have gone up and down in price.7 hrs agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv3y61qq41o,"Falling turkey and Brussels sprout prices mean Christmas dinner will cost a little less at the supermarket checkout this year.The price of Brussels sprouts has fallen by 12%, while a 10lb (4.55kg) frozen turkey will cost you £1.21 less than it did last year, research for the BBC suggests.But digging deeper we discovered root vegetables have gone up in price this year, after wet weather delayed the planting season.When all the trimmings are totted up, a family Christmas is set to cost £31.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of £32.18. It reflects food prices rising at a slower rate in the past year, as UK inflation has eased. The annual change in price for products across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl were measured by Retail tracking platform Assosia.The crown of the Christmas feast, the turkey, has fallen in price by 6% this year, according to this data.Tom Copas, managing director of Copas Turkeys in Cookham, Berkshire, said the price of turkeys had begun to stabilise after a couple of ""incredibly turbulent"" years that had pushed up the cost of rearing his birds.""Hence we're seeing incremental changes in prices year on year, rather than dramatic ones,"" added Mr Copas, whose family has been rearing turkeys since 1957.However, Mr Copas says he'd seen slower sales and more demand for smaller turkeys this year, perhaps indicating customers were tightening their belts.""It's possibly people are trying to keep the overall basket spend down."" Brussels sprouts came in at 12p cheaper for a 500g bag compared to last year.Hot summers and sudden cold snaps of the previous two years had made things hard for producers, says John Inglis, senior commercial manager at ESG Drysdale, one of the UK's largest sprout producers.But he says this year has seen us get ""back to normality"" after ""a couple of tricky seasons"" and sprouts are thriving again.The price change may not affect everyone though as the humble sprout can be a divisive veg. A YouGov poll earlier this year found that a quarter of Britons dislike them, with the controversial brassica more popular with older generations. Root vegetables were behind the largest price changes in our Christmas shop.Maris Piper potatoes have seen a whopping 26% increase, with a typical 2kg bag up from £1.58 to £1.99.Tracy Bush, co-director of Provenance Potatoes in Kent, says poor weather has had a lot to do with the price of spuds going up in recent years.""We've had a particularly wet spring so planting was difficult for any root crops, and then the autumn when crops are lifted and harvested, that was also very difficult,"" she says. Carrot farmer Rodger Hobson says the same wet weather delayed this year's carrot planting season. Last year, the weather was so bad that supermarkets had to import carrots. This year,they've gone up by 13.4% to 69p per kilo.But Mr Hobson says he would not be surprised if ""when it comes to Christmas week they'll be down to 20p a kilo"".This is because carrots are often chosen as ""loss leaders"" in supermarkets. They're sold at a loss to attract customers in to spend on more profitable items.Ged Futter is a retail specialist who used to be a buyer for Asda. He says supermarkets drastically reduce their prices in the week before Christmas.""Every year they do the same thing,"" he says, noting that supermarkets usually fight for customers with cut price ""potatoes, carrots, parsnips, Brussels spouts"".Mr Hobson says perishable items make for good loss leaders because customers can't stockpile them when they are cheap. If supermarkets reduced the price of long-life items like baked beans, shoppers might be tempted to buy their year's supply in December, he says.While loss-leaders are good for shoppers, Mr Futter stressed these below-cost prices ""don't show the true cost to the farmer"" and can generate a lot of food waste.""People think that food is cheap to produce - that's not true."" This year price rises were not confined to the main meal - the cost of Christmas desserts also went up.Christmas pudding is 11% more expensive than in 2023, and mince pies are up by 5%, according to Assosia's research.Jessica White, the owner of Meg Rivers artisan bakery, says: ""Our costs have indeed gone up of ingredients, packaging, wages and like everyone - electricity."" But she says her company had chosen not to put prices up this year.They have already sold out of Christmas puddings and have had to make more to fulfil the waiting list, she says. ""We make more and more each year and don't notice a drop in demand."" BBC News also looked into how the cost of a Christmas dinner might vary depending on where you shop.We compared prices on the websites of the UK's top five supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Aldi.Our snapshot from one day, which does not take into account loyalty card prices, suggests Aldi was the cheapest supermarket for a basic list of Christmas essentials, at around £24.30.Asda was second cheapest at £28.22, followed by Morrisons and Sainsbury's.Tesco was most expensive at £36.51. Last year,our research suggestedMorrisons was the most expensive, with Tesco third. While we tried to find equivalent items across all five supermarkets, there are some small differences in product sizes or types. So the cost of your Christmas dinner might vary between supermarkets and the items you choose.Prices will also vary the closer we get to Christmas as supermarket competition becomes even more fierce.Our BBC analysis should not be directly compared with the price rise figures from retail analysis firm Assosia as we both use a slightly different basket. Start with a budget: Plan ahead and add up hidden expenses, like tin foil for roasting a turkey.Write a food list: Decide on your must haves and what you might not miss.Bargain hunt: Look out for online offers as well as yellow sticker items which have been reduced.Use your freezer: Christmas foods that freeze well include butter, meat joints and some cheeses like cheddar.Join up with friends and family: This means you can buy bigger pack sizes, which are often better value.Read more from the BBC Food team here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Royal Mail takeover by Czech billionaire approvedThe £3.6bn deal by Daniel Kretinsky is cleared after agreeing ""legally binding"" undertakings.7 hrs agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg93390808o,"The sale of Royal Mail's parent company to a Czech billionaire has been cleared by the government.The £3.6bn takeover by Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group has been given the go-ahead after agreeing ""legally binding"" undertakings.The government will retain a so-called ""golden share"" that will require it to approve any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, HQ location and tax residency.EP Group will also have to maintain the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (USO), which currently means it has to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday, and parcels Monday to Friday. The company has committed to maintaining the USO for as long as it owns Royal Mail. Earlier this year, Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he would honour the service - in whatever form it takes -""for as long as I am alive"".The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business ""a fighting chance"".The regulator said in Septemberthat it was looking at these changes, with a decision due next year.Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were ""real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future"".Given letter numbers are falling ""we have to think about what is economical"", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year ""to make sure it is sustainable"". The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year. When debts are included, the deal values the company at £5.3bn.Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said while it was up to shareholders to approve the deal, the agreement the government had reached meant the takeover ""will be a good deal for the UK, be a good deal for the people who work for Royal Mail and a good deal for customers"".Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had ""resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings.He added, that EP Group had a ""mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers"". The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.It has also reached an agreement in principle with unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run.Dave Ward, the general secretary of the CWU union, told the BBC it was an ""extensive agreement"" and the deal was the ""best opportunity"" to save the future of Royal Mail.However, he added that the union had ""not agreed anything"" on USO reform and there was ""a long way to go"" before that happened. IDS also owns a highly profitable European parcels business called GLS which made over £300m last year. This offset lossesat Royal Mail, allowing IDS to report a small profit.By bringing GLS parcel know-how to the UK market, coupled with investment in out-of-home delivery lockers, Mr Kretinsky hopes to build a pan-European logistics business.The hope is that this will enable Royal Mail to claw back market share it has lost in recent years in the profitable and growing parcels business.Mr Kretinsky has a net worth of £6bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury's, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU.Earlier this year the takeover was called in for review under national security laws as Royal Mail is considered vital national infrastructure.But speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a ""legitimate business figure""whose alleged links to Russiahad already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago. Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses.The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels.Last week,Royal Mail was fined £10.5mby the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.Ofcom's Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would ""absolutely"" hold Royal Mail to account.Jenny Hall, director of corporate affairs at Royal Mail, told the BBC the company was investing to improve performance, but it was ""really important"" the USO was reformed to reflect consumer trends.She added that Royal Mail would always try to keep postage costs as low as possible, but prices do ""need to reflect the realities of delivering the service"".The price of a second-class stamp, which is currently 85p, is regulated by Ofcom, with the amount Royal Mail can increase it by each year tied to inflation.However, there are no such limits on first-class stamps, and in October Royal Mailpushed the price for first-class mailup by 30p to £1.65, citing ""very real and urgent"" financial challenges for the move.

"West African bloc pins hopes on ambitious superhighway from Ivory Coast to NigeriaThe road could breathe new life into West Africa's regional bloc, Ecowas.1 day agoAfrica",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr56dq0gr2mo,"West African leaders are holding a crucial summit in Nigeria's capital Abuja, focusing on the morale-sapping departure of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger from their 15-member bloc Ecowas.Few think the military rulers of the three dissident states can be persuaded to pause or reverse their decision.While faced with this blow to regional unity, West Africa is also poised to start work on a 1,028km (689 miles) highway from Ivory Coast's main city Abidjan - through Ghana, Togo and Benin - to Nigeria's biggest city Lagos.Construction is supposed to start in 2026 and pledges of $15.6bn (£12.3bn) have already been mobilised from a range of funders and investors.Just as Western Europe matched the Soviet-led communist bloc with a ""Common Market"" that later evolved into today's trading powerhouse, the  European Union (EU), so Ecowas may find that a drive for prosperity and growth proves to be its most effective response to the wave of military coups and nationalism that have swept across the region since 2020.The plan to build a modern transport corridor along the West African coast was originally approved eight years ago - long before the coups that have overturned civilian rule in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.Preparatory studies, led by the African Development Bank, were commissioned.But when these were presented last month, the timing could hardly have come at a better moment for reinvigorating the battered self-confidence of Ecowas (Economic Community of West African States).Neither traditional diplomacy, nor sanctions, nor even the threat of military intervention in Niger, had managed to push the juntas into organising elections and restoring civilian government, as required by Ecowas governance rules.The defiant regimes declared they would leave the 15-member bloc altogether.They have subsequently spurned the remaining members' efforts to persuade them to stay, although the Ecowas envoy, Senegal's new, young President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who shares their nationalistic outlook, is still trying.Until this crisis, Ecowas was Africa's most cohesive and politically integrated regional grouping, with a creditable record of crisis management and even the deployment of peacekeepers in troubled member states.With the departure of Mali, Burkina and Niger, the bloc will lose 76 million of its 446 million people and more than half its total geographical land area, with the loss of vast tracts of the Sahara – a painful blow to prestige and self-belief. The shock of the three countries' withdrawal may boost those pushing for tougher governance and democracy rules.Meanwhile, the ambitious coastal transport corridor project, conceived to support economic development, will also serve a political purpose - demonstrating the remaining member countries' capacity to work together and accelerating the trade growth and investment attraction of coastal urban West Africa, already the most prosperous part of this vast region.And just as the EU's wealth and dynamism proved a powerful attraction for former communist states, perhaps rising prosperity across Ecowas will eventually entice the now disenchanted further north states into rejoining the bloc.Construction of the proposed four-to-six lane motorway is forecast to create 70,000 jobs, with completion ambitiously targeted for 2030.And the plan is to acquire a sufficiently broad strip of land along the route to later accommodate a new railway line, linking the big port cities along the Gulf of Guinea. Existing rail routes extend inland, but there is no rail line along the coast.The road will connect many of West Africa's largest cities - Abidjan, with 8.3 million people, Accra (4 million), Lomé (2 million), Cotonou (2.6 million) and Lagos, estimated at close to 20 million or perhaps even more.Several of the cities are key gateway ports for the flow of trade in and out of the region.Already the bureaucratic hassles and risks of petty corruption that have so often complicated life for drivers passing from one country to the next are beginning to wane.At many border crossings, modern one-stop frontier posts, where officials from both countries work side by side to check passports and transit documents, have replaced the assorted huts where drivers and passengers queued at a succession of counters while one set of border police and customs officers after another laboriously worked their way through the formalities.And now the proposed highway and rail line promise to further speed the flow of trade and travel between the coastal economies, boosting competitiveness and integration and transforming the region's attraction for investors - just as the EU transformed trade and development across the European continent.And that process of economic and administrative integration of course had enormous political consequences.It acted as a powerful incentive for countries still outside the bloc to improve economic governance, strengthen democracy and tackle corruption, in the hope of qualifying for membership.Perhaps Ecowas can emulate this precedent, and lure the dissident states into re-joining, particularly if flagship projects such as the transport corridor give a real fillip to growth.For not only do Mali, Niger and Burkina face severe development and security challenges, but they are also all landlocked, and heavily dependent on their coastal neighbours, through transport, trade and labour migration. Huge volumes of trade, formal and informal, flow across the borders.Livestock from the three countries in the Sahel is exported on the hoof to feed city dwellers in Dakar, Abidjan and Lagos.Onions and potatoes grown in Niger's arid climate are prized by coastal household shoppers, while Ivorian, Ghanaian and Nigerian manufactured goods are exported in the opposite direction.Millions of Burkinabès and Malians are settled in Ivory Coast, a mainstay of the workforce for its cocoa plantations.Moreover, the coup leaders are not pulling out of the West African CFA franc, an eight-country single currency, backed by France, that hampers competitiveness but provides a solid defence against inflation and monetary instability.Yet these deep ties between the Sahelian countries and coastal West Africa were not sufficient to deter the military regimes in Mali, Burkina and Niger from announcing their withdrawal from Ecowas.Hostility to the bloc, which they portray as bullying and arrogant, has paid political dividends, boosting their popularity at home. And Morocco talks of opening up an alternative trade corridor to its Atlantic ports, which could broaden the options.But if the remaining Ecowas countries can accelerate their own drive for prosperity, pruning back trade barriers and pressing forward with breakthrough projects such as the coastal highway and rail line, then gradually they may salve today's political bruises and mistrusts and draw the Sahel states back into a reunified West African regional identity.Paul Melly is a consulting fellow with the Africa Programme at Chatham House in London.

"Trump rings bell on record stock market - but will it last?The US president-elect comes into office with a strong economy, but investors hope for more and current highs may be difficult to sustain.4 days agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn8yjw11go,"Donald Trump stood on Wall Street on Thursday, a euphoric crowd of America's business elite assembled before him, and hammered the bell to kick off morning stock market trading.The mood was celebratory. Not only had the president-elect just beennamed Time person of the year, but the stock market, already up strongly, has surged to new heights since his election.For Trump, whose public appearances have been relatively sparing since his election win last month, the visit was a reminder of the high value he places on market opinion.But whether history will look back on his appearance as the well-timed heralding of another economic boom - or a death knell - remains to be seen. Trump is entering office with a US economy that is, in the recent words of America's central bank boss, Jerome Powell, the envy of many other countries, with solid growth of 2.8%, unemployment near historic lows of 4.2% and that mysterious ingredient known as ""productivity"" on a tear.It has combined to push American stocks to record levels: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to end the year up more than 17%.The S&P 500, a bigger index made up of America's 500 largest companies, has surged 28% since January, while the Nasdaq, where tech firms have a major presence, has rallied more than 40%.Investors are hoping for more, with the Trump administration expected to loosen regulations and green-light takeovers that might have come under harsh review during President Joe Biden's administration.At the stock exchange on Thursday,  a who's who of the business world, including Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon and Target chief Brian Cornell, had assembled. The president-elect was greeted with sustained applause and whistles, which later gave way to chants of ""USA! USA!""His visit marked a relatively rare appearance by a sitting or former president. But analysts have warned that current highs may be difficult to sustain in the year ahead.Job creation is already slowing and price inflation is proving stubborn.Many of Trump's priorities - including slashing government spending, erecting stiff, broad-based trade barriers and embarking on mass deportations of migrants - if enacted, could pose further challenges to growth.Though debate is ongoing about how much the president actually will do, the proposals are generating uncertainty and have the potential for significant disruption, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.""The totality of the policies, if implemented to the degree that the president has articulated, I think will be problematic for the economy,"" he said. At the stock exchange on Thursday, Trump kept his comments focused on other parts of his agenda more palatable to markets: his promises to lower taxes from 21% to 15% for businesses manufacturing in America, cut regulation and speed up government approvals.""A nuclear power plant - I would say a week would be enough time. What do you think?"" he said, to laughter.Similar policies, which Zandi said would be good for the corporate bottom line, if not necessarily the economy, boosted share prices significantly during Trump's first term.He cited those gains repeatedly as a sign of his administration's success, especially at the start.But the market retreated during trade wars with allies and with China - then nose-dived at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, before rapidly recovering.Ultimately, the S&P 500 gained more than 67% on his watch - a record bested by presidents Bill Clinton in the 1990s and Barack Obama during his first four years.Under Biden, the index has risen 59% so far. Whether Trump can repeat that performance is something he has declined to predict.The main US stock indexes closed lower on Thursday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq dipping by around 0.5%.Asked at the stock exchange what investors should be buying in anticipation of the future, Trump, somewhat uncharacteristically, demurred.""I don't want to get into a situation where they do and we have a dip or something"", he said, then added, ""Long term, this is going to be a country like no other.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OpenAI whistleblower found dead in San Francisco apartmentThe San Francisco medical examiner's office determined Suchir Balaji's death to be suicide and police found no evidence of foul play.2 days agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0el3r2nlko,"An OpenAI researcher-turned-whistleblower has been found dead in an apartment in San Francisco, authorities said.The body of Suchir Balaji, 26, was discovered on 26 November after police said they received a call asking officers to check on his wellbeing.The San Francisco medical examiner's office determined his death to be suicide and police found no evidence of foul play.In recent months Mr Balaji had publicly spoken out against artificial intelligence company OpenAI's practices, which has been fighting a number of lawsuits relating to its data-gathering practices. In October,the New York Times published an interviewwith Mr Balaji in which he alleged that OpenAI had violated US copyright law while developing its popular ChatGPT online chatbot.The article said that after working at the company for four years as a researcher, Mr Balaji had come to the conclusion that ""OpenAI's use of copyrighted data to build ChatGPT violated the law and that technologies like ChatGPT were damaging the internet"".OpenAI says its models are ""trained on publicly available data"".Mr Balaji left the company in August, telling the New York Times he had since been working on personal projects.He grew up in Cupertino, California, before going to study computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.A spokesperson for OpenAI said in a statement cited by CNBC News that it was ""devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones during this difficult time"".US and Canadian news publishers, including the New York Times, and a group of best-selling writers, including John Grisham, have filed lawsuits claiming the company was illegally using news articles to train its software.OpenAI told the BBC in November its software is ""grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation"".If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line, , or contactSamaritans.If you're in the US, call 988, or contactLifeline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tracing the powerful family roots of suspected killer Luigi MangioneIn his home city, the accused shooter's family name has meant wealth, power, prominence and philanthropy for decades.2 days agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl3jkjxp75o,"This week, the surname Mangione became associated with the killing of health-insurance executive Brian Thompson in New York City, when 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was charged with his murder.But for decades, the name has meant something entirely different: wealth, power, prominence, philanthropy - particularly within the Italian community of Baltimore.They're one of, if not the, ""most respected"" Italian families in the area, according to Giovanna Aquia Blatterman.Now 77, Ms Aquia Blatterman, who arrived in the US from Sicily in1953, said she has known three generations of Mangiones.The family is ""generous"" and ""self-made"", she said, while Luigi, who she met briefly about eight years ago, appeared clever, approachable and handsome – ""as you can tell"".""Something has occurred with him,"" she mused, referencing the last several days. ""He's two different people.""She also insisted he's innocent until proven guilty: ""This is one of the greatest honours of being an American citizen."" The cluster of streets in downtown Baltimore that make up Little Italy, where Ms Blatterman owns one of the neighbourhood's many Italian restaurants, has been an enclave for Italian immigrants since they flocked there in the 1800s and 1900s.An Italian tri-colour flag is still proudly displayed. Even fire hydrants are painted green, white and red.Nicholas Mangione Sr was born there in 1925, starting life in a poor immigrant family. He spent the first eight years of his life in a one-room flat with an outdoor privy toilet,according to the Baltimore Sun.During World War Two, he served in the Navy in the South Pacific before returning to his Maryland home where he built a series of enterprises as well as, according to local media, a combative - even aggressive – reputation when it came to his business interests.The dark fandom behind healthcare CEO murder suspectKilling of insurance CEO reveals simmering anger at US health system In a 1995 story about him titled 'Fiery builder has softer side', Mr Mangione recalled buying the Turf Valley resort, which lies to the west of Baltimore, in 1978.""People thought I needed money from the mafia to buy this place. They asked me what family I belonged to. I told them, 'I belong to the Mangione family. The Mangione family of Baltimore County.'""In 1988, Turf Valley was at the centre of a racism row when the then-manager - Mangione Sr's now deceased nephew - was recorded using a racial slur. The incident made local news.But within Baltimore's tight-knit Italian community, there's loyalty to Nick Mangione and his memory. Life-long Little Italy resident, 83-year-old Mary Ann Campanella, called him an ""excellent man"".""If you went to him (for help),"" she said, ""and he looked at you – you got it. He helped everyone.""The family patriarch - who long ago had moved his expanding family out to the suburbs - died in 2008, leaving behind 10 children, and 37 grandchildren, including Luigi Mangione. When he was arrested, police say Luigi Mangione was carrying a hand-written document detailing his alleged ""ill will"" towards corporate elites, which US media have reported included the line ""these parasites had it coming"".Unlike his grandfather, Luigi was born into privilege, attending an all-boys private school in a northern Baltimore suburb, where fees can reach $37,690 a year.From a rainy Baltimore roadside, the sprawling campus of the Gilman School is visible, including its centrepiece, a double-fronted, 1920s red-brick hall behind which are extensive sporting grounds.One family associate likened it to Eton, the English boys school attended by aristocratic familes and members of the Royal Family.Many have wondered how this 26-year-old man went from being a young, promising graduate to an alleged fugitive, arrested in a Pennsylvania McDonald's.Who is Luigi Mangione, CEO shooting suspect?Who was Brian Thompson, healthcare CEO gunned down in New York?How Luigi Mangione's legal defence could take shape The Mangiones boast a wealth of cousins, aunts and uncles, who have spread well beyond Little Italy. But the family has remained largely silent following Mr Mangione's arrest, only releasing a short statement via Republican state lawmaker and cousin Nino Mangione to say they are ""shocked and devastated"".Requests to talk to family members were met either with no response or a firm, but polite: ""No comment.""One simply told us: ""Everything that needs to be said has been.""Dylan Segelbaum, a reporter for local news website the Baltimore Banner, said that as Luigi Mangione grew up, his family owned businesses ranging from country clubs and golf courses to assisted living facilities.""The Mangione family is prominent in the Baltimore area,"" he said. The name is literally imprinted on Baltimore.A plaque at the entrance to the Family Center at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center reads: ""Donated by Nicholas and Mary Mangione.""""The family's very philanthropic,"" Mr Segelbaum said, noting the family gave more than $1m to the hospital.But Ms Blatterman insists the Mangiones have remained ""relatable"" and don't ""showboat"".Previously a salon stylist, Ms Blatterman said she cut the hair of Luigi Mangione's grandmother Mary Mangione, who she calls ""Miss Mary"", in the early 1970s.And, before the Covid pandemic, she said she played bocce (an Italian bowling game) with members of the Mangione family, including Luigi Mangione's parents, Louis and Kathleen Mangione.""Kathy has a travel agency. She does trips to Italy,"" she said.While she expressed sympathy for the family of Mr Thompson, 50, the health-executive fatally shot on 4 December, Ms Blatterman said her thoughts are also with the Mangiones.New York grand jury begins hearing Mangione case - report""I can't imagine what the family's going through. I'm sorry about Mr Thompson, they're going through hell, too - but so is this family going through hell.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Canadian government moves to end weeks-long postal strikeAround 55,000 postal workers began striking on 15 November over pay and working conditions.3 days agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8g4yvjdqvo,"The Canadian government is moving to end a nearly month-long postal workers' strike that has disrupted mail delivery across the country ahead of the holidays.On Friday, Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon ordered the Canadian Industrial Relations Board to send Canada Post employees back to work if an agreement is not reached soon with their employer.Around 55,000 postal workers began striking on 15 November over pay and working conditions. The two sides have since failed to reach an agreement, with federal mediators concluding a few weeks ago that negotiations were too far apart.The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) denounced the government's order ""in the strongest terms"". In a statement on Friday, the CUPW called the move an ""assault on our constitutionally protected right to collectively bargain and to strike"".Meanwhile, Canada Post said in a statement that it looks forward to welcoming its employees back to work and resuming its services.The Crown corporation added that it remains committed to reaching a negotiated agreement with the union, but said it wants to do so while ""also meeting the postal needs of Canadians.""The Canadian Industrial Relations Board is expected to rule on Minister MacKinnon's request next week.The strike has impacted businesses during one of the biggest shopping periods of the year. With deliveries halted, inventory has sat in warehouses across the country while shipping costs have increased.Lorne James, an Ontario business owner, told the BBC last week that he fears the strike is ""going to wipe out a good number of businesses"" due to steep financial losses.In Canada's northern communities - where Canada Post is the sole mail delivery provider - the strike has had a profound impact on those who rely on the postal service for the delivery of essentials, like medicine and cheque payments.Service Canada has also reportedly withheld the delivery of 85,000 passports and other important documents while the strike is ongoing.Announcing the order on Friday, Minister MacKinnon said ""Canadians are rightly fed up"" with the strike. He added that it is not a decision he takes lightly, ""but in this situation, it is the right one.""The order would ask striking employees to go back to work under their existing collective agreement until 22 May, by which then the minister hopes a new agreement will be in place.The union has been trying to negotiate a wage increase of 19% over the next four years - higher than the 11.5% increase initially proposed by Canada Post. They are also negotiating issues around benefits, sick leave, job conditions and security.""Our demands are reasonable: fair wages, safe working conditions, the right to retire with dignity and the expansion of services at the public post office,"" the union has said.CUPW national president Jan Simpson has since accused Canada Post of dragging its feet so the federal government can intervene. Meanwhile, Canada Post accused the union of increasing their demands instead of reaching a compromise.When the strike began, Canada Post warned that its services would continue to be disrupted even if an agreement is reached due to backlogs in deliveries.It added that it has already felt a financial impact, with customers switching to private competitors or stopping use of its services altogether as the strike is ongoing.The last Canada post began in October 2018 and ended after more than a month when the federal government mandated that employees go back to work through legislation.That job action cost Canada Post around C$135m ($96.7m; £76.27m).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UK 'doesn't have enough builders' for Labour's 1.5m homesBuilders and developers say reforms are needed to recruit more tradespeople to build the homes being promised.3 days agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg1471rwpo,"The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.The government confirmed there was a ""dire shortage"" of construction workers but said it was ""taking steps to rectify"" the problem. Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.And on Thursday he unveiled sweepingchanges to the planning system and vowed to override ""blockers"" standing in the way of building the new homes.Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineersThe HBF said while the industry had ""the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out"".When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: ""The short answer is no.""He told the BBC the government would have to ""revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production"" for their target to be met.""They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,"" Mr Thomas said.But the HBF also said the UK ""does not have a sufficient talent pipeline"" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.The industry body admitted the sector itself had not ""attracted"" enough new recruits in recent years.All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said. Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.""If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,"" he said.The average rates of pay for these jobs ""are high"" but the issue was ""more about availability of labour with skills, he said.An experienced bricklayer can earn around £45,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about £38,000 and electricians £44,000, according to government figures. Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and ""restrictions"" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that ""in hindsight"", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the ""norm"".According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.Last month, the government announced £140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established ""homebuilding skills hubs"" to fast-track training.A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to ""make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously"".But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said theywere ""unrealistic"" and ""impossible to achieve"".The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said ""a more pro-development policy approach"" would enable the industry to ""invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply"".Despite recruitment challenges, Barratt Redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what Barratt itself forecast,before the merger with Redrowin October.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Milei, Musk and Maga: Is Argentina influencing the US?As Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.3 days agoLatin America",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y86vv0wneo,"As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US.Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.Despite his tough austerity measures anda continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according toa survey carried out earlier this monthby the CB Consultora organisation.That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can ""make Argentina great again"". Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is ""experiencing a giant improvement"" under his leadership.But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed? Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before beingrenationalised in 2008.All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-calledDepartment of Government Efficiency- a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (£1.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing ""a fantastic job"" in Argentina by ""deleting entire departments"" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing. But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that ""taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense"".""The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.""Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was ""bursting into crisis every few years"".""That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else."" Marcelo J García, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a ""masterpiece"" of political marketing that has ""captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe"".But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.""I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,"" he told the BBC.He points out that Trump's policies ""require big government in some areas"", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. ""You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.""In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government. Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the ""woke agenda"". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.While he is in favour of Mercosur's recentfree-trade deal with the European Union,he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur ""has ended up becoming a prison"".""If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?"" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose ablanket 25% tariffon goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US. Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: ""You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.""The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.As Marcelo J García sees it, Milei is a ""divisive leader"" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.""The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,"" he says.""Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,"" he adds.In his view, this is a real weakness: ""You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.""Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BBC complains to Apple over misleading shooting headlineApple's new artificial intelligence features falsely made it seem the BBC reported Luigi Mangione had shot himself.3 days agoTechnology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno,"The BBC has complained to Apple after the tech giant's new iPhone feature generated a false headline about a high-profile murder in the United States.Apple Intelligence, launched in the UKearlier this week, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to summarise and group together notifications.This week, the AI-powered summary falsely made it appear BBC News had published an article claiming Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. He has not.A spokesperson from the BBC said the corporation had contacted Apple ""to raise this concern and fix the problem"".Apple declined to comment. ""BBC News is the most trusted news media in the world,"" the BBC spokesperson added.""It is essential to us that our audiences can trust any information or journalism published in our name and that includes notifications.""The notification which made a false claim about Mangione was otherwise accurate in its summaries about the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria and an update on South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.But the BBC does not appear to be the only news publisher which has had headlines misrepresented by Apple's new AI tech.On 21 November, three articles on different topics from the New York Times were grouped together in one notification - with one part reading ""Netanyahu arrested"", referring to the Israeli prime minister.It was inaccurately summarising a newspaper report about the International Criminal Court issuing an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, rather than any reporting about him being arrested.The mistake was highlighted on Blueskyby a journalist with the US investigative journalism website ProPublica.The BBC has not been able to independently verify the screenshot, and the New York Times declined to comment to BBC News. Apple says one of the reasons people might like its AI-powered notification summaries is to help reduce the interruptions caused by ongoing notifications, and to allow the user to prioritise more important notices.It is only available on certain iPhones - those using the iOS 18.1 system version or later on recent devices (all iPhone 16 phones, the 15 Pro, and the 15 Pro Max). It is also available on some iPads and Macs.Prof Petros Iosifidis, a professor in media policy at City University in London, told BBC News the mistake by Apple ""looks embarrassing"".""I can see the pressure getting to the market first, but I am surprised that Apple put their name on such demonstrably half-baked product,"" he said.""Yes, potential advantages are there - but the technology is not there yet and there is a real danger of spreading disinformation.""The grouped notifications are marked with a specific icon, and users can report any concerns they have on a notification summary on their devices. Apple has not outlined how many reports it has received.Apple Intelligence does not just summarise the articles of publishers, and it has been reported the summaries of emails and text messageshave occasionally not quite hit the mark.And this is not the first time a big tech company has discovered AI summaries do not always work.In May, in what Google described as ""isolated examples"", its AI Overviews tool for internet searches told some users looking for how to make cheese stick to pizza should consider using ""non-toxic glue"".The search engine's AI-generated responses also saidgeologists recommend humans eat one rock per day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 days agoInfluencer's brand faces backlash over bullying claimsFans are outraged by allegations of body-shaming and a toxic workplace at fashion company Djerf Avenue.3 days agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4pkypde42o,"Swedish clothing brand Djerf Avenue is facing a backlash from fans following claims of bullying and body-shaming against its founder Matilda Djerf.An investigation by Swedish news outletAftonbladetreported that 11 current and former employees described being belittled, called names and yelled at in the workplace.Ms Djerf, 27, told the BBC she was ""deeply sorry"" to anyone who has felt mistreated under her leadership.But customers like 22-year-old Sumi Mrkulic have vowed to ""never purchase anything or voice support again"". Sumi, from London, said she was particularly concerned after Aftonbladet reported that some models were told they didn't fill out a pair of jeans, while others were called fat.Djerf Avenue'swebsitepromotes a world ""filled with kindness, inspiration, and respect,"" and the brand is known for its size inclusivity and diverse model representation.Sumi told the BBC: ""It renders all of their efforts to be inclusive completely performative. I actually find it really spineless.""Influencer Matilda Djerf launched the brand in 2019 and it quickly became popular with young women. It says it made around $35m (£27.5m) in revenue last year.It recently held its first 10-day pop-up shop in London, which saw queues forming up to three hours before the store opened. Giulia Carrozzo, 20, from Germany, received an order from Djerf Avenue the day before the allegations emerged. She said she would be sending it back in light of the report.""Djerf Avenue has always marketed itself as a body-positive, inclusive and empowering brand, so hearing allegations of body-shaming and a toxic work environment felt like a complete betrayal of the values they claim to uphold,"" she said.""I knew immediately that this wasn't something I could support.""Matilda Djerf, who started her online career in 2016, was recognised for her work within retail and e-commerce on the Forbes 30 under 30 list in 2023.Giulia said: ""To me, supporting a brand led by a woman felt like celebrating progress and uplifting women in business. However, these allegations... directly contradict those values.""I can't justify supporting a brand that doesn't practise the values it promotes. Until there's real accountability and change, I won't be purchasing from them."" Matilda Djerf said in a statement: ""If any team member has felt mistreated in their role because of my actions, I am deeply sorry, and I want to sincerely apologize.""I don't recognize myself in all the claims that have been made, and I've chosen not to comment on individual cases. However, I do believe it's valuable that these concerns are being raised, as it gives both me and Djerf Avenue the opportunity to grow and improve.""I want to emphasize that I take full responsibility and see this as a chance to reflect, grow, and contribute to a better culture for everyone at Djerf Avenue.""Djerf Avenue's chief operating officer, Pernilla Bonny, said the company acknowledged the challenges in its workplace environment and had taken steps to address them.These actions include conducting monthly anonymous employee surveys, implementing an independent whistleblower function, strengthening the management team and carrying out an independent workplace assessment with an external psychologist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 days agoN Korea made millions from remote work scheme, US saysFourteen North Koreans have been charged with fraud in the US over an alleged long-running conspiracy.4 days agoAsia",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdnz3elwzvo,"A federal court in St Louis has indicted 14 North Koreans for allegedly being part of a long-running conspiracy aimed at extorting funds from US companies and funneling money to Pyongyang's weapons programmes.The wider scheme allegedly involves thousands of North Korean IT workers who use false, stolen, and borrowed identities from people in the US and other countries to get hired and work remotely for US firms.The indictement says the defendants and others working with them generated at least $88m (£51.5m) for the North Korean regime over a six-year period.North Korea's mission to the UN did not immediately reply to a request for comment from BBC News. The prosecutors say the suspects worked for two North Korean-controlled companies - China-based Yanbian Silverstar and Russia-based Volasys Silverstar.They were among a group of 130 North Korean IT workers employed by the two firms where they were internally referred to as ""IT Warriors"", according to the US Department of Justice.The suspects were allegedly ordered to seek salaries of $10,000 a month from their US employers.On top of the monthly wage, they would also raise funds for the North Korean regime by stealing valuable company information and threatening to leak it unless the employer made an extortion payment.The group is now facing wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other charges.Aside from using stolen identities to avoid detection, prosecutors said they paid people residing in the US to receive, set up, and host laptops provided by the US employers.They would then instruct those US residents to install remote access software allowing them to appear to be working from the US when they were actually overseas.Investigators believe the suspects are in North Korea making it unlikely that they will ever face justice.Still, the US State Department has announced that it will offer a reward of up to $5m for anyone who can provide more information on the suspects as well as Yanbian and Volasys.US officials have not named the American companies targeted in the scheme.""While we have disrupted this group and identified its leadership, this is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Ashley T. Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI's field office in St Louis.""The government of North Korea has trained and deployed thousands of IT workers to perpetrate this same scheme against US companies every day.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 days agoUK economy shrinks for second month in a rowThe economy had been expected to return to growth but it contracted by 0.1%.3 days agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5lw84w1yeo,"The UK economy shrank for the second month in a row in October as concerns about the Budget continued to weigh on confidence.Official figures showed a 0.1% drop, despite expectations that the economy would return to growth after a fall in September.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that activity had stalled or declined with pubs, restaurants and retail among sectors reporting ""weak months"".Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the figure was ""disappointing"", but added: ""We have put in place policies to deliver long-term economic growth."" Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: ""This fall in growth shows the stark impact of the chancellor's decisions and continually talking down the economy.""KPMG's chief economist Yael Selfin said that activity was ""held back by uncertainty ahead of the Budget on 30 October"" as businesses and consumers held back on spending.But some industries, such as real estate, law firms and accountancy, brought forward work before Reeves announced the Budget, the ONS said.Separately, a survey measuring consumer confidence in December found people were a little more positive about their personal finances for the year ahead.But the findings from market research firm GfK found that ""views on the economy are unchanged from November which suggests people don't know where we are going"".""In a nutshell, it's the continuing uncharitable view on the UK's general economic situation that's suppressing consumer confidence,"" said Neil Bellamy, consumer insights director at NIQ GfK.Shortly after becoming prime minister in July, Sir Keir Starmer warned that the Budget would be ""painful"" following 14 years of Tory government.He later denied that he was talking down the economy.The economy has grown just once over the past five months, ONS figures show. Capital Economics said GDP was 0.1% lower than before Labour won the election in July.""That suggests it's not just the Budget that is holding the economy back,"" said Capital's chief UK economist Paul Dales.""Instead, the drag from higher interest rates may be lasting longer than we thought.""The Bank of England has cut interest rates twice this year but, at 4.75%, they are still relatively high compared with recent years.The Bank will meet next week for the last interest rate decision of 2024, though it is not widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again until next year.Economists cautioned about placing too much emphasis on the reading for October.  It is an initial estimate of economic growth by the ONS and could be revised.Over the three months to October, the economy expanded by 0.1%. The manufacturing industry recorded the sharpest drop in activity in October, down 0.6%, followed by construction which fell by 0.4%.Meanwhile, the services sector, which makes up the bulk of the UK economy,  stalled with zero growth.Rick Gaglio, owner of menswear shop Twisted Fabric in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, said ""people are still being cautious"", and added that prices are still comparatively high.""That's just down to inflation and customers are feeling those price increases,"" he said. Mr Gaglio also said that retail sales were slow during the summer months due to wetter than usual weather.""It's been tough,"" he said. ""2024 generally for small businesses has been very, very tough and we just want to hear more good news, not bad news.""Sir Keir has said he wants the UK to secure the highest sustained economic growth of the G7 group of rich nations.Last week, he set out additional ""milestones"" to allow people to measure the government's progress. On the economy, he has pledged to increase real household disposable income per person.He also reiterated a promise to build 1.5 million homes in England.

4 days agoWhy 'digital twins' could speed up drug discoveryAI can create digital humans and digital organs that can be used in clinical trials.4 days ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8v73dkne3o,"This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments.The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.As these differences often aren’t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.“This allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,” says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson. In 2018 an investigation by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalistsrevealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.“To really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,"" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.""So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.“Even a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.""You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.”Ms Macpherson adds: “[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.” Adsilico’s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.Adsilico’s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants. More on AI and Medicine Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.Sanofi’s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process. “With a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,” says Matt Truppo, Sanofi’s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.“There is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.” Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.""[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.”Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks. Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.“A virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,” she says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 days agoSome businesses suspend NI sales due to new trade rulesRules come into force that will make it harder for some GB firms to sell goods to NI and the EU.3 days agoNorthern Ireland Politics,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ydrp0kjn5o,"New rules that affect businesses in Great Britain selling to Northern Ireland and the EU are a ""step backwards"", according to a London-based small business owner.The EU's General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR) creates new requirements for Great Britain businesses, including the need to have an agent in Northern Ireland or the EU.This has prompted some businesses to stop or suspend sales to Northern Ireland and the EU.The government said it has been supporting small and medium businesses across the UK to get ready for GPSR.However, Johanna Haughey-Lewis, the owner of homewares business Weirdstock, said ""there hasn't been enough time or enough information in order to get this right"". The rule change applies to Great Britain products going to Northern Ireland because Northern Ireland's Brexit deal means it is still effectively in the EU's single market for goods.Weirdstock, which sells bedding, is among those that have decided to pause shipping to the EU and Northern Ireland.Ms Haughey-Lewis, who is originally from County Armagh, said she found out about the new rules ""through a social media post a couple of weeks ago"".""Whenever you look at the government website, the information on GPSR only came up there very recently, so not enough time for businesses to prepare,"" she toldBBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.""Even some of the bigger retail stockists that I am with have only communicated about this for the first time this week, a few days before the deadline.""So it's not just the small businesses that aren't aware of it; there has been no kind of campaign or information about it,"" she added. Ms Haughey-Lewis informed her customers of the changes on social media.""As many of you know I am from Northern Ireland, Weirdstock has a wee customer base there so I am finding this particularly frustrating.""But at the same time I am determined to find a solution,"" she wrote.She said her Northern Ireland connection may potentially make it easier for her to find an agent but there are other challenges.The new requirements include the need to provide documentation to demonstrate the safety of your product.""There is no template for that, no guidance. It is very hard to find information on that,"" Ms Haughey-Lewis said.""This new legislation which feels like it has come out of nowhere, a bit of a surprise to me, it really has felt like a step backwards"".She is hoping that because her textile supplier in India is certified by global sustainability bodies it means the safety and traceability evidence will be there, but for now she is not clear exactly what she has to provide.""Hopefully I will be in a better position than other people because I have those certifications already,"" she added. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said that the UK government and local politicians had ""abandoned many traders"" who he said were now ""affected by mad EU trade rules"".Wilson told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that he wrote to the government in September to warn them of these issues but that ""nothing has been done"".Alliance Party assembly member Kate Nicholl said there were ""clear issues with communication and how the government have been engaging with those businesses"".She said Brexit had been a ""disaster"" for Northern Ireland, but that removing the current trade regulations under the Windsor Framework would cause ""even more damage and uncertainty for businesses in Northern Ireland"".""We just have to try to find solutions of how we can make this as easy as possible,"" she said. The EU has been working on GPSR since 2020 and it was approved by the European Parliament in May 2023.It updates existing rules to reflect the growth of online commerce and aims to give better protections for consumers.That include the need to have a ""responsible person"", which is effectively a compliance agent, inside the EU or Northern Ireland.That is a particular challenge for small businesses in Great Britain who are selling direct to consumers, therefore they have no physical presence in the EU or Northern Ireland.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) is calling on the government to give better export support to firms.Tina McKenzie, policy chair at the FSB, said: ""GPSR will be a real barrier to international trade for some of our small firms looking to export to EU member states, but also move goods to Northern Ireland.""While the UK government's newly published guidance is helpful, small firms are still faced with the complexity and associated costs around it.""Governments from both sides should look at removing unnecessary trade barriers, not least those arising from the product safety rules, for small businesses in the UK-EU Trade and Cooperative Agreement review in 2026.""It is understood the government expects GPSR to have a limited impact on the UK internal market as it largely formalises the reality of how many businesses are already operating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Telegram pushes extremist groups to users - studyCivil rights group examined 28,000 channels, finding white nationalist groups among those promoted.2 hrs agoTechnology",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgrvw29x4jo,"The social media platform Telegram uses an algorithm that promotes extremist content, a new study shared exclusively with the BBC has revealed.The report, from the US civil rights organisation the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), found that the ""similar channels"" feature introduced last year recommends extremist channels even to users browsing subjects such as celebrities or technology.A professor also showed BBC Panorama how he found someone within moments on Telegram who offered to ship an Uzi submachine gun to the UK for £850.Telegram says users are ""only presented with content they have chosen to engage with"" and it removes millions of pieces of harmful content daily. The company's founder, Russian billionaire Pavel Durov, is under formal investigation in France accused of failing to stop criminality on his platform.He has denied the allegations.Best known as a messaging app marketed with secretive features, Telegram also allows its almost one billion users to set up channels where they can broadcast messages and videos to up to 200,000 people at a time.SPLC researchers looked at 28,000 of these Telegram channelsfor their report Telegram's Toxic Recommendations.It found that users browsing mundane topics would be recommended extreme content - while users looking at one form of extreme content, such as anti-government conspiracies, would be pushed towards other extremist ideologies such as antisemitism or white nationalism. Lead researcher Megan Squire demonstrated how the algorithm works by searching for ""Donald Trump"" in a newly set up Telegram account.Immediately in the ""similar channels"" recommendations were multiple examples of channels promoting the Q-Anon conspiracy, which maintains with zero evidence that Mr Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media.Another search for ""UK riots"" showed a meme about Adolf Hitler as the first result, followed by suggestions for a series of channels run by violent far-right groups. ""Some of these groups are pretty active. You're not just on Telegram getting memes, you're getting shuffled into to actual events. They're having events on the ground with people showing up,"" Ms Squire said.In the hours after the Southport knife attack in August, which prompted riots, Telegram users posted some of the first calls for protest, along with false claims the suspected attacker was an asylum seeker.Ms Squire told BBC Panorama that the research showed Telegram had become a ""digital threat"".""On a scale of one to 10, Telegram I would say is an 11. It's dishing out enormous amounts of criminal content, extremist content. It is extremely dangerous in my opinion,"" she said. A former insider who was part of Telegram's inner circle for seven years, Elies Campo, told Panorama that he had challenged Pavel Durov about extreme material in 2021.""His stance was it's not up to a platform like us to decide who should be speaking out. It was clear that he didn't want to dedicate more resources to it,"" Mr Campo said.""I think if he could choose, he would choose more a stand where he doesn't have to moderate anything.""Prof David Maimon from Georgia State University, who has spent six years studying illegal content on Telegram, said there were tens of thousands of channels offering everything from tools for scammers to guns. ""Telegram is definitely one of the most important platforms criminals are using now for criminality,"" he said.He showed Panorama how within moments of posting a message saying he needed ""an Uzi and a shotgun"", a seller posted a picture of an Uzi and said he could ""get it fast-tracked"" to the programme's address in Belfast within two or three days.The French authorities have accused Pavel Durov of complicity in drug dealing, organised crime and sharing child abuse images on Telegram. He is currently on bail and is not allowed to leave France.Telegram says it takes extremist and illegal content very seriously and its moderation teams and AI tool remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.It says its users only receive the content to which they have subscribed - as Telegram does not ""inject or promote content"".""The 'channel suggestions' feature shows only channels with the same topic as those a user already follows. This approach ensures that users are only presented with content they have chosen to engage with. This is completely different from how other platforms make suggestions,"" the company said.Telegram said ''it does not amplify content, but instead shows topic-based suggestions tied to user choices"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'World-first' AI camera targets drink-driversDrink and drug-drivers in Devon and Cornwall are in the cross-hairs of a pioneering AI camera.2 days agoEngland,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0rqz003zdo,"Motorists under the influence of alcohol or drugs could be caught by a pioneering AI camera which is being tested for the first time in Devon and Cornwall.The state-of-the-art Heads-Up machine can detect road use and behaviour consistent with drivers who may be impaired by drink or drugs.Police further up the road can stop the vehicle, talk to the driver and do a roadside test for alcohol and illegal drugs.Geoff Collins, UK general manager of camera developer Acusensus, said: ""We are delighted to be conducting the world's first trials of this technology right here in Devon and Cornwall."" The camera can be moved quickly to any road in either county, without warning, with drivers unaware they have been spotted until police pull them over.""We are all safer if we can detect impairment before it causes an incident that could ruin lives,"" said Mr Collins.Acusensus cameras have previously been used to help police catch drivers using mobile phones at the wheel or not wearing seatbelts.With drink-drivers six times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash,Devon & Cornwall Policeare hoping the Heads-Up system will help to save lives. ""Our officers cannot be everywhere,"" said Supt Simon Jenkinson, whose team polices the 14,000 miles of roads in the two counties.""As members of theVision Zero South Westroad safety partnership, we're committed to doing everything we can to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads.""Embracing emerging technology such as these cameras is vital in that quest.""The trial is taking place throughout December to coincide with other drink-driving campaigns.

"What we know about mysterious drones over New Jersey and other statesThe US government says the flying objects pose no threat to national security, but their origin and intentions remain unclear.21 hrs agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62785697v0o,"Mystery continues to swirl after nearly a month of drone sightings over New Jersey and other US states, alarming some residents.US authorities have been unable to provide definitive answers, saying only that the objects are not believed to pose a danger to the public or national security.On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed the sightings included drones, as well as manned aircraft commonly mistaken for drones.He added that he knows of ""no foreign involvement"" to do with the unmanned aerial vehicles.Some lawmakers have criticised the government's handling of the drone reports and the lack of public information.Here's what we know. Dozens of drone sightings have been reported overNew Jerseysince 18 November, but others have been reported around the US north-east.Some of the flights were spotted near Picatinny Arsenal - a sensitive military research facility - as well as near President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in the town of Bedminster, New Jersey.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has since issued temporary flight restrictions prohibiting drone flights over Bedminster and Picatinny.Sightings have also been reported in several other states:InNew York City, several drones were reported flying over the Bronx on 12 DecemberStewart Airfield inNew Yorkstate had to shut down for about an hour on 13 December because of drone activity, Governor Kathy Hochul saidInConnecticut, police confirmed ""suspicious drone activity"". A drone detection system is now in use near the towns of Groton and New LondonInMaryland, former Republican Governor Larry Hogan said he saw what appeared to be ""dozens"" of drones over his home in DavidsonvilleInMassachusetts, two men were arrested on 14 December after a ""hazardous drone operation"" near Logan International Airport's airspace in Boston, police saidMultiple sightings have been reported in easternPennsylvania,including over PhiladelphiaIn October, the Wall Street Journal reported that mysterious drones were seen for 17 days near US military facilities inVirginiaIn late November, drones were also spotted over three US airbases in the UK, with British defence sources telling the BBC suspicion had fallen on a ""state actor"".Drones were also reported near the Ramstein US military airbase in Germany in early December.Are mystery drones above US bases in England something sinister? In a call with reporters, officials from several US agencies said there was no evidence of any threat to public safety.""I think there has been a slight overreaction,"" an official from the FBI said.The homeland security secretary told ABC News on Sunday he knows of ""no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the north-east"".""And we are vigilant in investigating this matter,"" he said.Mayorkas added: ""If there is any reason for concern, if we identify any foreign involvement or criminal activity, we will communicate with the American public accordingly."" Following a briefing with the Department of Homeland Security on 11 December, New Jersey assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia said the drones appeared to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.Fantasia said the aircraft were up to 6ft (1.8m) in diameter, travelling with lights turned off and ""operate in a co-ordinated manner"".Secretary Mayorkas told ABC that an explanation for the uptick in drone sightings could be to do with a change in federal law last year that allowed drones to be flown at night.""That may be one of the reasons why now people are seeing more drones than they did before, especially from dawn to dusk,"" he said. It is unclear who might be operating them.New Jersey Republican representative Jeff Van Drew said that the drones were coming from an Iranian ""mothership"" in the Atlantic, while Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi said there was a ""non-trivial"" chance that China could be involved.The Pentagon, White House and homeland security department have all insisted that there is no foreign origin for the objects.A northern California man was charged on with flying a drone over and taking pictures of Vandenberg Space Force Base, located near Santa Barbara, on 30 November.The man, 39-year-old Chinese national Yinpiao Zhou was arrested just before he boarded a flight to China.But there has been no suggestion this incident has any connection with the spate of drone reports on the other side of the country. President-elect Trump has suggested the drones couldn't be flying without the government's knowledge.""Let the public know, and now,"" he wrote on his Truth Social media platform. ""Otherwise, shoot them down.""Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, also said the drones should be shot down.Shooting down drones is illegal, however.New York State Governor Hochul has called on the federal government to allow states to crack down on the drones.Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has requested that federal officials send drone detection systems to New York and New Jersey.In a statement, the FAA warned that drone operators who conduct unsafe or dangerous operations could face fines of up to $75,000 (£59,000) and have their drone pilot certificates revoked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two arrested after 'hazardous drone operation' near Boston airportThe flying objects were spotted flying ""dangerously close"" to Logan International Airport, said police.21 hrs agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvnnj8g34o,"Two people have been arrested after allegedly conducting a ""hazardous drone operation"" near the airspace of the US city of Boston's main airport, police said.Robert Duffy, 42, and Jeremy Folcik, 32, were arrested on Long Island, part of the Boston Harbor Islands, on Saturday night.They were charged with trespassing and police said they may face further counts and fines over the drones, which were ""dangerously close"" to Logan International Airport.Their arrests follow a series of drone sightings across the US north-east in recent weeks. Police have given no indication that the sightings are connected to these arrests. Police said the incident in Boston occurred at 16:30 local time (21:30 GMT) on Saturday when a police officer detected a drone operating ""dangerously close"" to Logan International Airport.Police said they identified the drone's location and tracked the operators' position to a decommissioned health campus on Long Island. Because of the drone's proximity to an airport, FBI counter-terrorism agents helped the investigation.What we know about the mysterious drones buzzing over New JerseyWhen officers arrived on the scene, police said three people attempted to flee, two of whom - Mr Duffy and Mr Folcik - were apprehended. A drone was discovered in a backpack carried by Mr Duffy, police said.The third suspect is believed to have fled the island in a small vessel and has not so far been found.It was not immediately clear whether Mr Duffy and Mr Folcik had legal representation. Police said they were yet to be arraigned. US government officials have been seeking to reassure residents of the north-east that no national or public security threats have been identified in the hundreds of drone sightings.Flying objects have been reported in states including New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Massachusetts, but most of the sightings have been in New Jersey.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC News on Sunday the federal government was working in ""close co-ordination"" with state and local authorities on the issue.He said it was ""critical"" they be given the ability to counter drone activity under federal supervision.Mayorkas said the rise in drone sightings could be down to a change in federal law last year that allows the aircraft to be flown at night.""That may be one of the reasons why now people are seeing more drones than they did before, especially from dawn to dusk,"" he said.He also said he knew of ""no foreign involvement"" in drone sightings around the US north-east.New York Governor Kathy Hochul has called for Congress to grant states more powers to tackle the drones, which forced runways at Stewart Airfield in the state to shut down for about an hour on Friday night.She said on Sunday that federal officials were sending a drone detection system to New York.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has requested that the technology also be sent to New Jersey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7 hrs agoSocial media given 'last chance' to tackle illegal postsPlatforms have three months to take action or they could be fined up to 10% of global turnover.7 hrs agoTechnology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy83jdpgw5o,"Online platforms must begin assessing whether their services expose users to illegal material by 16 March 2025 or face financial punishments as the Online Safety Act (OSA) begins taking effect.Ofcom, the regulator enforcing the UK's internet safety law, published its final codes of practice for how firms should deal with illegal online content on Monday.Platforms have three months to carry out risk assessments identifying potential harms on their services or they could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover.Ofcom head Dame Melanie Dawes told BBC News this was the ""last chance"" for industry to make changes. ""If they don't start to seriously change the way they operate their services, then I think those demands for things likebans for children on social mediaare going to get more and more vigorous,"" she said.""I'm asking the industry now to get moving, and if they don't they will be hearing from us with enforcement action from March.""Under Ofcom's codes, platforms will need to identify if, where and how illegal content might appear on their services and ways they will stop it reaching usersAccording to the OSA, this includes content relating to child sexual abuse material (CSAM), controlling or coercive behaviour, extreme sexual violence, promoting or facilitating suicide and self-harm.What is the Online Safety Act - and how can you keep children safe onlineBut critics say the Act fails to tackle a wide range of harms for children.The Molly Rose Foundation - set up in memory of teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after being exposed to self-harm images on social media - said the OSA has ""deep structural issues"".Andy Burrows, its chief executive, said the organisation was""astonished and disappointed"" by a lack of specific, targeted measures for platforms on dealing with suicide and self-harm material in Ofcom's guidance.""Robust regulation remains the best way to tackle illegal content, but it simply isn't acceptable for the regulator to take a gradualist approach to immediate threats to life,"" he said.And children's charity the NSPCC has also voiced its concerns.""We are deeply concerned that some of the largest services will not be required to take down the most egregious forms of illegal content, including child sexual abuse material,"" said acting chief Maria Neophytou.""Today's proposals will at best lock in the inertia to act, and at worst create a loophole which means services can evade tackling abuse in private messaging without fear of enforcement.""The OSA became law in October 2023, following years of wrangling by politicians over its detail and scope, and campaigning by people concerned over the impact of social media on young people.Ofcom began consulting on its illegal content codesthat November, and says it has now ""strengthened"" its guidance for tech firms in several areas. Ofcom says its codes include greater clarity around requirements to take down intimate image abuse content, and more guidance on how to identify and remove material related to women being coerced into sex work.It also includes child safety features such as ensuring that social media platforms stop suggesting people befriend children's accounts and warnings about risks of sharing personal information.Certain platforms must also use a technology called hash-matching to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) - a requirement that now applies to smaller file hosting and storage sites.Hash matching is where media is given a unique digital signature which can be checked against hashes belonging to known content - in this case, databases of known CSAM.Many large tech firms have already brought in safety measures for teenage users andcontrols to give parents more oversight of their social media activityin a bid to tackle dangers for teens and pre-empt regulations.For instance, on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, users under the age of 18 cannot be discovered in search or messaged by accounts they do not follow.In October, Instagram alsostarted blocking some screenshots in direct messagesto try and combat sextortion attempts - which experts have warned are on the rise, often targeting young men.Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said Ofcom's publication of its codes was a ""significant step"" towards the government's aim of making the internet safer for people in the UK.""These laws mark a fundamental reset in society's expectations of technology companies,"" he said.""I expect them to deliver and will be watching closely to make sure they do."" Concerns have been raised throughout the OSA's journey over its rules applying to a huge number of varied online services - with campaigners also frequently warning about the privacy implications of platform age verification requirements.And parents of children who died after exposure to illegal or harmful content have previouslycriticised Ofcom for moving at a ""snail's pace"".The regulator's illegal content codes will still need to be approved by parliament before they can come fully into force on 17 March.But platforms are being told now, with the presumption that the codes will have no issue passing through parliament, and firms must have measures in place to prevent users from accessing outlawed material by this date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13 hrs agoHospitals to use AI to cut patient visitsThe technology will analyse the data from an app used by patients with chronic respiratory illness.13 hrs agoHull & East Yorkshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c745q8w25keo,"An NHS trust hopes to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to improve a scheme that helps patients across Hull and East Yorkshire with chronic respiratory illness.The Lenus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) support system sees patients use an app to keep track of their symptoms.The Humber Health Partnership said there had been a 40% reduction in the number of patients needing to go back to hospital for treatment since the system was launched in March 2023.It hopes to reduce the figure even further - possibly by as much as 90% - by using AI technology to analyse the data from the app. The app encourages patients to regularly answer questions about their well-being so data can be gathered.It also allows them to message their NHS clinic directly.Professor Mike Crooks, who runs the service, said: ""This prompts them to make contact to initiate treatment early, so that we can give them the care they need to get them back on the right path before the point they need to come into hospital.""AI will be used to analyse the data and help medical professionals identify trends and triggers that can result in COPD needing care, Professor Crooks said.This will allow the clinic to put interventions in place to support patients before they reach the point of needing hospital care.Ruth was diagnosed with COPD at the age of 14 and has been using the Lenus app as part of her treatment.Before using the app, she was visiting the hospital three or four times a year.""Now those visits have been cut down to virtually zero,"" she said.""If I need to reach out to a clinician, I know that the app's there and I can do that.""

2 days agoOld hospital gowns made into octopus IV drip hooksA sustainable design graduate has created an octopus out of old gowns to cheer up sick children.2 days agoCornwall,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyxr882kp0o,"Old hospital gowns are being turned into octopus shaped poles for intravenous (IV) drips, in the hope of cheering up child patients.Product designer Florence Mitchell came up with the idea for Olly the Octopus when she was in the third year of her sustainable product design degree at Falmouth University in Cornwall.The fully-recycled cartoon-style blue octopuses are made out of old polypropylene gowns from the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro.She said she ""felt like he needed to be engaging, not just be a static thing that stands in the corner, but to bring him to life a bit"". Ms Mitchell got the idea after visiting the hospital and speaking to staff who identified that standard IV poles break easily.""Once broken, they need to be completely thrown out and then bought again new"", she said.The octopuses also have an interactive element.""I thought it would be awesome if we could make that into an app where 'Olly' comes to life.""Not only in a way that he moves, but more interactively, where kids can take their medication with him and feed him and maybe we can bring an element into this where parents can also log on and see how their kids are doing in terms of their mood.""So, it was something that could potentially relieve some of that anxiety for parents as well as making the experience for kids more engaging.""Other design considerations involved making it something that could be easily removed by staff on the wards, and making sure the weight could be taken by the poles.Ms Mitchell said they are designed to hold three times more weight than standard IV hooks, with 10 tentacles representing NHS values. She now hopes to improve the product by making it more sustainable, and to develop it for wider use.""I'd really love to see Olly in hospitals, if possible,"" she said.Kelly Mengham, ward sister for the Gastro and Liver Unit, helped Ms Mitchell set up the project during the early stages and said it was an ""outstanding product"".""I can't wait to see Olly in action"", she added.

4 days agoControversial chatbot's safety measures 'a sticking plaster'Character.ai is facing legal action in the US over claims a bot on the site encouraged a teenager to kill his parents.4 days agoTechnology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zgd3kk50o,"Chatbot platform Character.ai is overhauling the way it works for teenagers, promising it will become a ""safe"" space with added controls for parents.The site is facing two lawsuits in the US - one over the death of a teenager - and has been branded a ""clear and present danger"" to young people.It says safety will now be ""infused"" in all it does through new features which will tell parents how their child is using the platform - including how much time they're spending talking to chatbots and the ones they speak to the most.The platform - which allows users to create digital personalities they can interact with - will get its ""first iteration"" of parental controls by the end of March 2025.But Andy Burrows, head of the Molly Rose Foundation, called the announcement ""a belated, reactive and completely unsatisfactory response"" which he said ""seems like a sticking plaster fix to their fundamental safety issues"". ""It will be an early test for Ofcom to get to grips with platforms like Character.ai and to take action against their persistent failure to tackle completely avoidable harm,"" he said.Character.aiwas criticised in Octoberwhen chatbot versions of the teenagers Molly Russell and Brianna Ghey were found on the platform.And the new safety features come as it faces legal action in the US over concerns about how it has handled child safety in the past,with one family claiminga chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a ""reasonable response"" to them limiting his screen time. The new features include giving users a notification after they have been talking to a chatbot for an hour, and introducing new disclaimers.Users will now be shown further warnings that they are talking to a chatbot rather than a real person - and to treat what it says as fiction.And it is adding additional disclaimers to chatbots which purport to be psychologists or therapists, to tell users not to rely on them for professional advice.Social media expert Matt Navarra said he believed the move to introduce new safety features ""reflects a growing recognition of the challenges posed by the rapid integration of AI into our daily lives"".""These systems aren't just delivering content, they're simulating interactions and relationships which can create unique risks, particularly around trust and misinformation,"" he said.""I think Character.ai is tackling an important vulnerability, the potential for misuse or for young users to encounter inappropriate content.""It's a smart move, and one that acknowledges the evolving expectations around responsible AI development.""But he said while the changes were encouraging, he was interested in seeing how the safeguards hold up as Character.ai continues to get bigger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 days agoMark Zuckerberg's Meta donates $1m to Trump fundIt appears to be the latest attempt by the Meta boss to build a closer relationship with the incoming president.4 days agoTechnology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j9e1x9z2xo,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has donated $1m (£786,000) to an inauguration fund for President-elect Donald Trump.The tech giant's boss, Mark Zuckerberg,dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lagoresort in November, having sought to repair his and his firm's relationship with Trump following the election.Trump previously was highly critical of Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook - calling the platform ""anti-Trump"" in 2017.Meta is not believed to have made similar donations to President Joe Biden's  inaugural fund in 2020 or to Trump's previous inaugural fund in 2016. The company confirmed its million-dollar donation to the inaugural fund to several outlets on Wednesday.Inauguration funds are used to pay for events and activities when a new president takes office - some consider them an attempt to curry favour with a new administration.The donation was confirmed by CBS, the BBC's US media partner, on Wednesday, and wasfirst reportedby the Wall Street Journal.The BBC has approached Meta for comment.Trump will be sworn in as the 47th US president on 20 January. Relations between Trump and Mr Zuckerberg historically have been far less cordial.They particularly soured when Facebook and Instagram suspended the former president's accounts in 2021, after they said he praised those engaged in violence at the Capitol on 6 January.Since then, Trump has waged a war of words against Meta - calling Facebookan ""enemy of the people"" in March.He said a law that would ban TikTok in the US unless sold off by its parent company, ByteDance, would unfairly benefit Facebook.In August, Mr Zuckerberg told Republican lawmakers in a letter thathe regretted bowing to pressure from the Biden administrationto ""censor"" some Facebook and Instagram content during the coronavirus pandemic.Trump wrote in a book published in September that Mr Zuckerberg would ""spend the rest of his life in prison"" if he tried to intervene in the 2024 election.But the president-elect appears to have since softened his position.He told a podcast in October it was ""nice"" Mr Zuckerberg was ""staying out of the election"", and thanked him for a personal phone call after he faced an assassination attempt.Still, Mr Zuckerberg isn't nearly as close to Trump as fellow tech titan Elon Musk.The Tesla and X owner has been dubbed Trump's ""First Buddy"" because of his extensive donations to his election campaign.That led to Mr Musk being placed in charge of a newDepartment of Government Efficiency (Doge).There has been no such rapprochement between Mr Musk and Mr Zuckerberg - although the cage fight between them that was once mootednow appears to be off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5 days agoHackers find hole in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts' cyber-securityThe hack has left some hungry customers unable to make online orders.5 days agoTechnology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gl9np1g2go,"Doughnut chain Krispy Kreme says it has been hit by a cyberattack which has disrupted its online systems.Some customers in the US have been unable to make online orders as a result of the hack, which occurred in late November but has only just been disclosed.Krispy Kreme revealed the attack in a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) on Wednesday.It said the incident was ""reasonably likely"" to ""have a material impact"" on the firm's business operations, but clarified that brick-and-mortar shops remain open. ""We're experiencing certain operational disruptions due to a cybersecurity incident, including with online ordering in parts of the United States,"" reads a message on the Krispy Kreme website.""We know this is an inconvenience and are working diligently to resolve the issue.""The firm told the BBC in a statement it ""immediately"" took steps to investigate and contain the incident, and has brought in cybersecurity experts.""We, along with them, continue to work diligently to respond to and mitigate the impact from the incident, including the restoration of online ordering,"" it said.No groups have publicly taken responsibility for the hack.Krispy Kreme is a large chain in the US, which has more than 1,400 shops worldwide.In the UK it is smaller, but its 120 locations make it the largest speciality doughnut retailer in the country.Krispy Kreme stated in its SEC filing that it has cybersecurity insurance, which it expects ""to offset a portion of the costs"".It said it expected these costs to arise from a loss of digital sales, fees for the experts it has hired, and the restoration of impacted systems.Cyber-attacks have caused serious disruption this year, plaguing key infrastructure includinghospitalsandtransport systems.""The proliferation of cyberattacks in 2024 shows that hackers are willing to target anything and everything,"" said Spencer Starkey, from cyber-security firm SonicWall.""It's vital every single business has a robust roadmap in place to deploy if and when an attack happens,"" he added.Social media is taking this incident somewhat less seriously, however.""Anyone messing with Krispy Kreme should be jailed for life,"" joked one user on X.""Cybercriminals, you've gone too far this time,"" posted another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 days ago'Christmas lights' galaxy reveals how Universe formedThe galaxy resembling Christmas lights hanging in the cosmos has space scientists feeling festive5 days agoScience & Environment,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr0j7625kzo,"Nasa’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has for the first time captured an image of what our galaxy likely looked like just as it was forming - and it's got space scientists feeling very Christmassy.“I just love the sparkle galaxy with its Christmas lights shining as it was when the Universe was just 600 million years old,” Prof Catherine Heymans, Scotland’s Astronomer Royal, told BBC News.The image shows ten balls of stars of different colours, appearing like Christmas tree baubles hanging in the cosmos.It's the first time that scientists have witnessed clumps of stars assembling to form a galaxy like our own Milky Way and holds clues as to how the Universe was formed. Scientists have named the distant galaxy Firefly Sparkle, because it also looks like a swarm of multi-coloured fireflies.From its orbit in space unhindered by Earth's atmosphere, the most powerful telescope ever built has already shown usmore distant and therefore older galaxies,but not one like our own in the early stages of forming and not in such detail.“The data of what happened at this stage of the Universe is very sparse,” according to Dr Lamiya Mowla of Wellesley College in Massachusetts, who co-led the research.“But here, we are actually watching a galaxy as it is being formed brick by brick. The galaxies we normally see around us are already formed so this is the first time we have seen this process,” she told BBC News. Prof Heymans, Scotland’s Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team, described the discovery as “gorgeous, scientifically important and extremely festive”.“I find it amazing that humans have built a telescope that allows us to peer so far back in time and that we can see these very nascent phases of the galaxy in such a beautifully festive way.”The star clusters are of different colours because they are at different stages in their formation, according to Dr Mowla.“It is so beautiful because the early life of a galaxy is extremely active,"" she said. ""There is so much happening, there are new stars being born, there are massive stars dying, there is a lot of gas and dust around it and there is nitrogen and oxygen and because of the state they are in, you have these lovely colours.“We are able to tell something about the ages of each cluster, the composition of their elements and the temperatures at which they formed.”When Dr Mowla came across the galaxy, she had never seen clumps of stars in such vivid and varying colours. It led her to believe that there was something different about this system, so she checked how far away it was.To her surprise it turned out to be more than 13 billion light years away.The light from Firefly Sparkle is from not long after the creation of the Universe and so has taken more than 13 billion years to reach us. It is so small and so far away that not even JWST would have been able to see it, were it not for an extremely lucky cosmic coincidence. There was a cluster of galaxies exactly between Firefly Sparkle and the JWST, which distorted spacetime to stretch the light from the faraway galaxy and effectively act as a gigantic magnifying glass.Astronomers call this process gravitational lensing, which in this instance enabled the research co-lead Dr Kartheik Iyer of Columbia University in New York, and other members of the team, to see for the first time, incredible details of how the first galaxies like our own Milky Way formed.“It takes the light coming from the firefly and bends it and amplifies it so we can see it in glorious detail,” he told BBC News.""Our reconstruction shows that clumps of actively forming stars are surrounded by diffuse light from other stars. This galaxy is literally in the process of assembling.""""When it does all this and we are able to see this incredible faraway galaxy, it is a very humbling, magical feeling.”The research has been published in the journal Nature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Israeli strikes kill 50 in Gaza, Hamas-run health ministry saysThe Israeli military says Sunday's strikes targeted sites used by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.6 hrs agoMiddle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rnvy1zn10o,"More than 50 people were killed in Israeli air and ground attacks across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, according to local medics and rescuers.They said children, a cameraman who worked for the Al Jazeera TV network and personnel from the Civil Defence agency were among the dead.The Israeli military said it targeted sites used by Hamas and the allied armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad.The Hamas-run health ministry said the deaths meant the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza during the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas had surpassed 45,000. The ministry does not make a distinction between combatants and civilians, but it reported in October that 29,980 children, women and elderly were among the identified fatalities.The figures are often disputed by the Israeli government, which says almost 20,000 ""terrorists"" have been killed, but they are broadly accepted by UN agencies.The war began when Hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Many of those killed on Sunday were in a UN-run school being used as a shelter for displaced families in the southern city of Khan Younis.Harrowing footage showed a bloody scene on the third floor of Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz School, with children's bodies apparently among those being removed.""People were safe, staying in their homes after they prayed the dinner prayer. They were sitting, sleeping, and staying put in their places,"" Manal Tafesh, whose brother and his children were among those killed, told Reuters news agency outside a local mortuary.Medics said at least 13 people were killed, while a spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said she had heard reports of around 20 casualties, many of them women and children.""It's just doesn't stop. It's so relentless the pain and the suffering that we continue to have,"" Louise Wateridge told the BBC from central Gaza.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had ""conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists who were operating inside a command-and-control centre"" embedded within the school.It also accused Hamas and other armed groups of exploiting civilians and using civilian infrastructure as human shields.Medics said several more people were killed at another school-turned-shelter in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, which the UN said has been under siege by Israeli forces for more than two months.The UN said it was monitoring reports that more than 1,500 people were newly displaced after Israeli forces besieged Khalil Aweida school and shelled it.The IDF said on Sunday that its forces ""conducted a targeted raid on a terrorist meeting point in the Beit Hanoun area"".""In co-operation with the [Israeli Air Force], the troops struck dozens of terrorists from both the air and ground, and additional terrorists were apprehended,"" it added. Another strike hit a Civil Defence building in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said the strike killed the directors of its Nuseirat and Sheikh Radwan centres along with two volunteers, one of whom he named as Ahmad Baker al-Louh. Another five people were injured, three of them critically, he added.""The Israeli occupation has once again shown the world that there is no protection for humanitarian workers in Gaza and no adherence to international humanitarian laws,"" he said, adding that 94 Civil Defence workers had been killed since the start of the war.Ahmad al-Louh was a cameraman for the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network, which strongly condemned what it called Israel's ""targeted killing"" of its journalist.It said Louh had been covering a rescue operation by the Civil Defence following an earlier strike on Sunday and that it came ""just days after the targeting of his house"".""The network calls on all human rights and media organisations to condemn the Israeli occupation's systematic killing of journalists in cold blood, the evasion of responsibilities under international humanitarian law, and to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice,"" a statement said.The IDF said the Civil Defence building was used by ""terrorists to plan and carry out an imminent terror attack against IDF troops"".""Among the terrorists eliminated in the strike was the Islamic Jihad terrorist Ahmad Bakr al-Louh, who previously served as a platoon commander in the Islamic Jihad's Central Camps Brigade,"" it alleged, without providing any evidence.Al Jazeera did not comment on the Israeli allegation, butLouh's cousin Mahmoud told the Associated Press: ""We were stunned by the Israeli occupation statement.""""These claims are lies and misleading to cover up this crime,"" he added.The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 137 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ireland's Israel stance 'more extreme than any other country'The Israeli ambassador to Ireland says the decision to close its embassy was tough but not taken lightly.2 hrs agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0nwd9n9ylo,"Ireland has taken ""a more extreme stance than any other country"" against Israel, the Israeli ambassador to the country has said.Dana Erlich was speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ after her country's decision to close its embassy in Ireland.Erlich said the ""tough decision"" was not taken lightly.Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris said that he did not regret the Irish government's intervention in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) case in relation to Israel. Ireland had previously indicated its support for South Africa's legal action against Israel in the ICJ, saying it would ask the court ""to broaden its interpretation of what constitutes the commission of genocide by a state"".Harris has also rejected that Ireland is anti-Israel.However, speaking on RTÉ News at One, Erlich said of Ireland's request to the ICJ: ""This is an abuse of the international multilateral system by South Africa, we were sorry to see Ireland join it, but this joins an accumulation of steps, rhetoric and initiatives that we've seen Ireland trying to promote this past year.""Unfortunately in the past year we've seen Ireland position itself in an extreme position that no other country has put itself.""In most countries we have difficult conversations and we have disagreements – we accept criticism, but this has gone over that line in Ireland.""We see Ireland in a more extreme stance than any other country.""Erlich said she heard concerns from the Jewish and Israeli communities in Ireland.""We direct those concerns to the Irish government, the government that needs to make sure that they are safe, that there is a future for the Jewish community in Ireland,"" she said.""These assurances need to be made."" The taoiseach said his ""priority is to shine a spotlight on what is happening in the Middle East and we should not allow anything to distract from what is happening"".He said although he regretted the actions of the Israeli government regarding the embassy closure, he emphasised the importance of diplomatic relations and that Ireland would continue to engage with Israel.""I'm very proud of the decision Ireland has taken, we are pro human rights and international law,"" he added.Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said the Irish government must ""hold firm"" on its stance with regard to Israel and Gaza.McDonald described the move by Israel over its embassy in Dublin as an attempt to test the will of the Irish government.""We need to work with others to bring as much pressure as possible on the [Benjamin] Netanyahu regime,"" she said. Ireland's Jewish Representative Council chairperson said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the deterioration in the relationship between the Ireland and Israel.Chairperson Maurice Cohen said that the closure of Israel's embassy has caused distress for Israeli people in Ireland.He said the Irish government's intervention in the ICJ risks ""oversimplifying a highly complex and tragic conflict, unfairly isolating Israel, and undermining the integrity of the term 'genocide'.""Mr Cohen said that for the Jewish community in Ireland, ""the closure of the embassy represents not only a symbolic blow but also a practical disadvantage"".""Consular services provided by the embassy are vital for those maintaining connections with family, culture, and heritage in Israel,"" he added.""Losing this resource will leave many feeling unsupported and aggrieved.""Closing the embassy risks alienating a significant segment of Irish society and sends a message that dialogue is being replaced by disengagement.""He said that the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland reaffirmed its commitment to peace and the protection of innocent lives ""on all sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict"", while also supporting Israel's right to defend itself from ""terrorism and existential threats"".Mr Cohen called on both the Irish and Israeli governments to seek pathways to rebuild trust and to ensure avenues for diplomatic engagement remain open. Daniel Epstein-O'Dowd, from the Ireland Israel Alliance, told BBC News NI that it was a ""predictable"" decision by Israel to close its embassy in Dublin and that ""post October 7th there has just been provocation after provocation by the Irish government"".He said it is a ""very symbolic move by Israel and showing that they ultimately don't see any value in retaining any diplomatic presence"" in the Republic of Ireland.""There are many Israelis who are in the tech industry here in Dublin who are a little bit stranded and isolated quite frankly, they feel the Israeli embassy was very much there for them, particularly in the dark days immediately post October 7th, the embassy really shone through in the sense of that community,"" he added.""So I think it is wondering where do they go next?""I don't think that detail has yet been released, but I think it is ultimately going to be somewhere else other than Ireland, it's a very sad day for anybody in Ireland or Israel."" Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said there are no plans to close its embassy in Israel.On 7 October last year, Hamas launched an attack in southern Israel killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.In retaliation, Israel launched a massive operation inside the Gaza Strip with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas.So far, at least 44,875 people have been killed and more than 100,000 injured - mostly civilians, the Hamas-run health ministry says.

"Amnesty accuses Israel of genocide against Palestinians in GazaIsrael denies the accusation, saying it is defending itself against Hamas attacks in accordance with international law.5 Dec 2024Middle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwl0v4w5j3o,"Amnesty International has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza war, which Israel strongly denies.The UK-based human rights group said its conclusion was based on “dehumanising and genocidal statements” by Israeli officials, digital images and witness testimony and must serve as “a wake-up call” to the international community.Israel’s foreign ministry describedthe 295-page reportas “entirely false and based on lies”, while the Israeli military said the claims were “entirely baseless and fail to account for the operational realities” it faces.In the past day, meanwhile, local medics say at least 50 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza. The biggest number of people were killed in the al-Mawasi tent camp for displaced people, where Israel says it was targeting Hamas operatives. Amnesty says that its research over months “has found sufficient basis to conclude that Israel has committed - and is continuing to commit - genocide against Palestinians”.The 1948 Genocide Convention, enacted following the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.Agnès Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary general, said Israeli actions “include killings, causing serious bodily or mental harm and deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction"".“Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,” she continued.The report by the global campaign group comes as the UN’s top court, the International Court of Justice at The Hague, continues to examine allegations by South Africa that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.Israel has called the case ""wholly unfounded"" and based on ""biased and false claims"".Responding to the allegations by Amnesty, Israel’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, described the human rights group as a “deplorable and fanatical organisation”.“The genocidal massacre on 7 October 2023, was carried out by the Hamas terrorist organisation against Israeli citizens,” he stated, adding that Israel as acting in self-defence and “fully in accordance with international law"".The Israeli military said it was “actively working to dismantle Hamas’ military infrastructure” in Gaza and that it “takes all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians during operations"".About 1,200 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, were killed during the Hamas-led attacks 15 months ago, which triggered the Gaza war.Since then, at least 44,532 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen as reliable by the UN. In the past day, Israel has continued to carry out attacks across the length of the Palestinian territory.At least 23 people were killed and many more wounded in an air strike on a camp for displaced people in al-Mawasi in Khan Younis. Social media video shows residents battling fires overnight.At the nearby Nasser Hospital, a local BBC cameraman filmed the arrival of the wounded, including blood-stained children and a disabled man. The bodies of two small children were among the dead brought wrapped up in blankets.Israel’s military said its attack targeted senior Hamas operatives acting in what it considers a humanitarian zone. “Following the strike, secondary explosions were identified, suggesting the presence of weaponry in the area,” it said in a statement.It said it had taken steps “to mitigate the risk of harming civilians” and accused Hamas of using civilians “as human shields for terrorist activity"".On Thursday, BBC footage showed people picking through the mangled wrecks of shacks and piles of ash.“The strike hit us without any warning and did this big massacre,” Mohammed Abu Shahli said. “The people here are refugees from different places - from Rafah and the north. They came to a place they thought was safe.”His head bandaged, Abdul Rahman Jamaa said seven members of his family were killed including his father and three brothers.He told the BBC: “There are no protected safe areas as the Israelis say. These are all lies.  May God protect us.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Israel says body of hostage Itay Svirsky recovered from GazaThe military says he was murdered by Hamas, which has claimed he was killed by an Israeli strike.4 Dec 2024Middle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjgevlv839o,"The Israeli military says the body of an Israeli hostage held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip has been recovered in a joint operation with the Shin Bet security service.A statement said Itay Svirsky, 38, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri during Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, was “murdered in captivity by his captors”.Hamas said in January that Svirsky and another hostage, Yossi Sharabi, 53, had been killed by Israeli air strikes.Earlier, the military said an investigation had concluded that the most plausible explanation for the deaths of six other hostages found dead in a tunnel in Gaza in August was that they were shot by Hamas ""close"" to the time of an Israeli air strike. Troops recovered the bodies of Yagev Buchshtab, 35, Alexander Dancyg, 76, Avraham Munder, 79, Yoram Metzger, 80, Chaim Peri, 79, and Nadav Popplewell, a 51-year-old British-Israeli dual national, along with those of six Hamas fighters, in the southern Khan Younis area.The military said it was “highly probable"" the hostages' deaths were related to a February strike on a nearby underground site that targeted Hamas commanders.Pathologists found indications of gunshots on the hostages’ bodies, while no gunshot wounds were found on the fighters' bodies, it added.Due to the extended time that had passed ""it was not possible to determine with complete certainty the precise cause of death of the hostages or the exact timing of the gunfire”, according to the military.“According to the most plausible scenario, the terrorists shot the hostages close to the time of the strike,” it said. “However, it is also possible that the hostages were shot by other terrorists post-mortem; it is even possible that the hostages were killed prior to the strike in the area.”An Israeli military official told reporters that the military believed the six Hamas fighters “were killed from secondary effects of our strike"", like lack of oxygen.The military also stressed that it had ""no information”, at the time of the strike that the hostages were in the underground site that was targeted or its vicinity.“Had such information been available, the strike would not have been carried out,” it said, noting that it was preceded by the required planning and approval process.There was no immediate comment from Hamas. Buchshtab, Dancyg, Munder, Metzger, Peri and Popplewell were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and Kibbutz Nirim on 7 October 2023.About 1,200 people were killed by Hamas-led gunmen that day, while 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages.The US, Egypt and Qatar have spent months working on a deal to secure the release of the 96 remaining hostages, 34 of whom are presumed dead, in return for a ceasefire in Gaza.But the negotiations have stalled, with Hamas and Israel blaming each other for the impasse.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the military investigation’s findings ""serve as yet another proof that the lives of hostages face constant, daily danger”.“Time is of the essence - many of the hostages are still alive and enduring impossible conditions of abuse, starvation and isolation,” it warned.The forum called on US and the other mediators to “do everything necessary to achieve a deal for the hostages' return”.It separately welcomed the return of Itay Svirsky's body for burial in Israel, saying it ""provides crucial closure for his family"".Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Wednesday that ""pressure on the monstrous organisation known as Hamas is growing"".“There is a chance that this time we will truly be able to advance a hostage deal.” More than 44,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.On Wednesday evening, at least 20 people were killed by an air strike in the Israeli-designated “humanitarian area” in al-Mawasi, west of Khan Younis, according to medics and the Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency.Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal said a tented camp for displaced families was bombed and that the dead included five children.The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted ""senior Hamas terrorists"" in the area.Another 10 people were killed when Israeli strikes hit three houses in Gaza City, in northern Gaza, according to Mr Bassal.Earlier, five people were killed in an Israeli strike on the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, medics said. Local media said four of the dead were children and that the strike had targeted a queue outside a bakery.The Israeli military said it had struck a “terrorist target” in Nuseirat, without giving any details, according to the Associated Press.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gazans displaced by war now face a new threat: winterPalestinians displaced by the war are living on Gaza's coast, exposing them to harsh winter storms.3 Dec 2024Middle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqdr0591qro,"The beaches of Gaza are no longer for day trips. Tens of thousands of people now have to live on the coastline, forced to leave their homes during the war.In recent days they have come under a new kind of assault: from winter seas battering their flimsy, makeshift dwellings.“Nothing is left in the tent: not mattresses, bedding, bread, everything was taken. The sea took it,” says Mohammed al-Halabi, in Deir al-Balah.“We rescued a two-month-old child who was dragged out to sea.”Nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is now displaced and nine in ten of those living in shelters are in tents, the UN says.With temperatures plummeting, many people have been falling sick. There have been floods of rainwater and sewage.“My children’s feet, their heads—everything is freezing,” Shaima Issa tells the BBC in Khan Younis. “My daughter has a fever because of the cold. We’re essentially living on the streets, surrounded by strips of fabric.  Everyone here is sick and coughing.”“When it rains on us, we’re drenched,” adds her neighbour, Salwa Abu Nimer, crying.  “The heavy rain floods us, and we don’t have a waterproof cover. The water seeps into the tent, we wear our clothes wet.”“No flour, no food, no drink, no shelter,” she went on. “What is this life I’m living? I go to the ends of the earth just to feed my children.” While the situation is worst in the north, UN officials are warning of dire shortages of medicines, food, shelter and fuel across Gaza, describing the situation as “catastrophic.”There are long queues for charity handouts in parts of central and southern Gaza where most people are living.On successive days, our local cameramen have filmed hundreds of people crowding outside bakeries where there is very little bread.  At times, there are crushes as those waiting surge forward.“I need a loaf of bread. I have pain, diabetes, and high blood pressure. I can’t push through crowds of people; I’m afraid I’ll suffocate and die,” says Hanan al-Shamali, who is in Deir al-Balah but originally comes from northern Gaza.“I need bread so that I can feed the orphans I take care of. Every morning, I come here.  In the end, do I get bread or not? Sometimes I get it, but most of the time, I don’t.” At the Kerem Shalom crossing, Israel’s main crossing point with Gaza, last week journalists were shown lorries moving goods that had gone through security checks.Aid entering the Palestinian territory remains at some of the lowest levels of the past year.  Israel blames aid agencies for distribution problems.“Unfortunately we're still seeing that the biggest backlog for humanitarian aid getting to where it needs to get to is the distribution capabilities of the international organisations, as the 800 trucks worth of aid around me attest to,"" said Shimon Freedman, spokesman for Cogat, part of the Israeli military that control the crossings.But inside Gaza, humanitarian workers sayarmed gangs have been looting incoming suppliesbrought through Kerem Shalom amid increased lawlessness. This has now led the biggest UN agency operating in the territory, Unrwa, to pause its use of this route for deliveries.The overall picture, says Antoine Renard, local head of the UN’s World Food Programme, is of Palestinians facing “a daily struggle for survival”.""The levels of hunger, devastation and destruction we are seeing now in Gaza is worse than ever before. People cannot cope anymore,” Mr Renard says. “There is barely any food coming in while markets are empty.”Amid the destruction in Gaza, there is still no end in sight to the war. Just the expectation of more suffering, as cold weather sets in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The grandfather had come out of retirement to help during the war.Last month speaking at a press conference at the Kamal Adwan Hospital, he held up a placard that read ""Save US"".It didn't work.""On his way to al-Awda Hospital to evaluate a patient, one of the tanks fired on him directly,"" according to Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital.""Unfortunately, he was killed instantly.""But some eyewitnesses say Dr Joudeh was shot by a drone.

It's devastating for people in the north who are relying on so few doctors,"" said Ms Wateridge.""Hospitals in the Gaza Strip are not hospitals anymore,"" she said.""There's no sanitation. There are hardly any doctors. There's no medical equipment.

"Israeli strikes kill 12 guarding Gaza aid lorries, medics sayThe Israeli military says it targeted two groups of Hamas members who planned to hijack the lorries.4 days agoMiddle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk0x64ll8jo,"At least 35 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, including 12 guarding incoming aid lorries, local medics and the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority say.Seven guards were killed in a strike in Rafah while protecting aid lorries from violent armed theft, which UN workers say is the main obstacle to getting supplies into southern Gaza. Another attack left five guards dead in Khan Younis.The Israeli military said it ""conducted precise strikes on armed Hamas terrorists"" who had planned to hijack the lorries.In a separate Israeli attack, 15 people were killed near Nuseirat refugee camp, the Civil Defence said. ""The occupation once again targeted those securing the aid trucks,"" Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal told the AFP news agency.He added that around 30 people, most of them children, were also wounded in the two strikes.The lorries were carrying flour to warehouses belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Mr Basal said.Recently - amid severe food shortages - UN workers say violent armed thefts have been the main obstacle to getting aid into the southern part of Gaza. Civilians, as well as remnants of Hamas police, have mobilised to try to counter the gangs.Hamas says Israeli military strikes have killed at least 700 police tasked with securing aid lorries in Gaza since the latest war began on 7 October 2023.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""Overnight, following intelligence information indicating the presence of Hamas terrorists, the IDF conducted precise strikes on armed Hamas terrorists gathered at two different meeting points in southern Gaza.""It added that ""all of the terrorists that were eliminated were members of Hamas and planned to violently hijack humanitarian aid trucks and transfer them to Hamas"".Separately, Israeli air strikes on two homes near Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, and Gaza City, in the north, killed 21 more people, the Civil Defence said.At least six children were among the 15 people killed in Nuseirat, while the bodies of six other people were found after a strike on an apartment in Gaza City, Mr Basal said.Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the Palestinian group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 44,800 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.After months of failed international efforts to end the war, Israel's defence minister has told his US counterpart there is a chance for a new deal that would allow the return of all of the remaining hostages, including American citizens.Other reports have suggested a limited deal with Hamas is being discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for the Middle EastWhat the latest developments mean for Iran's position - and for the prospect of peace in Gaza27 Nov 2024BBC InDepth",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygn5579gvo,"Listen to Jeremy read this articleFor most of the people of Lebanon, a ceasefire could not come quickly enough. A leading Lebanese analyst at a conference on the Middle East that I’m attending in Rome said she couldn’t sleep as the appointed hour for the ceasefire came closer.“It was like the night before Christmas when you’re a kid. I couldn’t wait for it to happen.”You can see why there’s relief. More than 3,500 citizens of Lebanon have been killed in Israeli strikes. Displaced people packed their cars before dawn to try to get back to whatever remains of their homes.Well over one million of them have been forced to flee by Israeli military action. Thousands have been wounded and the homes of tens of thousands of others have been destroyed.But in Israel, some feel they have lost the chance to do more damage to Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met the heads of Israel’s northern municipalities, which have been turned into ghost towns with around 60,000civilians evacuatedfurther south.Israel’s Ynet news website reported that it was an angry meeting that turned into a shouting match, with some of the local officials frustrated that Israel was taking the pressure off their enemies in Lebanon and not offering an immediate plan to get civilians home.In a newspaper column, the mayor of Kiryat Shmona, close to the border, said he doubted the ceasefire would be enforced, demanding that Israel creates abuffer zone in south Lebanon. In a poll commissioned by the Israeli station Channel 12 News those questioned were roughly split between supporters and opponents of the ceasefire.Half of the participants in the survey believe Hezbollah has not been defeated and 30% think the ceasefire will collapse. Back in late September, at the UN General Assembly in New York, a deal looked as if it was close. Diplomats from the US and UK were convinced that a ceasefire very similar to the one that is now coming into force was about to happen.All sides in the war appeared to have signalled their willingness to accept a ceasefire based on the provisions of Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed to end the 2006 Lebanon war: Hezbollah would pull back from the border to be replaced by UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese Armed Forces. As they moved in, Israeli forces would gradually move out.But Prime Minister Netanyahu went to the podium at the UN to deliver a fiery speech that refused to accept any pause in Israel’s offensive.Back at his New York hotel Netanyahu’s official photographer captured the moment as he ordered the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, along with most of his high command. Netanyahu’s office released the photos, in another calculated snub for American diplomacy.The assassination was a significant escalation and a blow to Hezbollah. In the weeks since, Israel’s military has inflicted immense damage to Hezbollah’s military organisation. It could still fire rockets over the border and its fighters continued to engage Israel’s invasion force. ButHezbollah is no longer the same threatto Israel. Military success is one of several factors that have come together to persuade Benjamin Netanyahu that this is a good time to stop.Israel’s agenda in Lebanon is more limited than in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories. It wants to push Hezbollah back from its northern border and to allow civilians to return to border towns.If Hezbollah looks to be preparing an attack, Israel has a side letter from the Americans agreeing that it can take military action.In a recorded statement announcing his decision, Netanyahu listed the reasons why it was time for a ceasefire. Israel, he said, had made the ground in Beirut shake. Now there was a chance ‘to give our forces a breather and replenish stocks,’ he continued.Israel had also broken the connection between Gaza and Lebanon. After the late Hassan Nasrallah ordered the attacks on Israel’s north, the day after Hamas went to war on 7 October last year, he said they would continue until there was a ceasefire in Gaza. Now, Netanyahu said, Hamas in Gaza would be under even more pressure. Palestinians fear another escalation in Israel’s Gaza offensive.There was one more reason; to concentrate on what Netanyahu called the Iranian threat. Damaging Hezbollah means damaging Iran. It was built up by the Iranians to create a threat right on Israel’s border. Hezbollah became the strongest part of Iran’s axis of resistance, the name it gave to its network of forward defence made up of allies and proxies. Just like Hezbollah’s surviving leaders, their patrons in Iran also wanted a ceasefire. Hezbollah needs a pause to lick its wounds. Iran needs to stop the geostrategic bleeding. Its axis of resistance is no longer a deterrent. Iran’s missile attack on Israel after Nasrallah’s assassination did not repair the damage.Two men, both now assassinated, designed Hezbollah to deter Israel not just from attacking Lebanon – but also from attacking Iran. They were Qasem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, who was killed by an American drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020. The order was issued by Donald Trump in his last few weeks in the White House at the end of his first term. The other was Hassan Nasrallah, killed by a huge Israeli air strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs.Hezbollah and Iran’s deterrence strategy matchedIsrael’s own deterrencefor almost 20 years after the end of the 2006 war. But among the profound changes caused by the 7 October attacks was Israel’s determination not to accept restrictions on the wars it would wage in response. America, its most important ally, also put almost no restrictions on the supply or use of the weapons it kept on providing.Nasrallah and Iran failed to see what had happened. They did not understand how Israel had changed.  They sought to impose a war of attrition on Israel, and succeeded for almost a year. Then on 17 September Israel broke out of it by triggering the miniature bombs built into the network of booby-trapped pagers its intelligence services had duped Hezbollah into buying.Hezbollah was thrown off balance. Before it could react with the most powerful weapons Iran had provided, Israel killed Nasrallah and most of his key lieutenants, accompanied by massive strikes that destroyed arms dumps. That was followed by an invasion of South Lebanon and the wholesale destruction of Lebanese border villages as well as Hezbollah’s tunnel network. A ceasefire in Lebanon is not necessarily a precursor to one in Gaza. Gaza is different. The war there is about more than security of the border, and Israeli hostages.It is also about revenge, about Benjamin Netanyahu’s political survival, and his government’s absolute rejection of Palestinian aspirations for independence.The Lebanon ceasefire is fragile and deliberately paced to buy time for it to work. When the 60 days in which it is supposed to take effect ends, Donald Trump will be back in the Oval Office. President-elect Trump has indicated that he wants a ceasefire in Lebanon, but his precise plans have not yet emerged. The Middle East is waiting for the ways he might affect the region. Some optimists hope that he might want to create a moment akin to President Nixon’s sensational visit to China in 1972 by reaching out to Iran.The pessimists fear he might abandon even the hollow genuflection that the US still makes to the idea of a creating an independent Palestine alongside Israel – the so-called two state solution. That might pave the way to annexation of those parts of the occupied Palestinian territories Israel wants, including much of the West Bank and northern Gaza.What is certain though is that theMiddle East has no chance of escapingmore generations of war and violent death until the region’s fundamental political ruptures are faced and fixed. The biggest is the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, along with most Israelis believe it is possible to dominate their enemies by pressing on to a military victory. Netanyahu is actively using force, unrestrained by the US, to alter the balance of power in the Middle East in Israel’s favour.In a conflict that has lasted more than a century both Arabs and Jews have dreamt repeatedly of peace through military victory. Every generation has tried and failed. The catastrophic consequences of the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 ripped away any pretence that the conflict could be managed while Israel continued to deny Palestinian rights to self-determination. The ceasefire in Lebanon is a respite. It is not a solution.Top picture credit: Getty Images BBC InDepthis the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

"Remembering the man who became Indian music's global ambassadorZakir Hussain, legendary tabla virtuoso, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy.11 hrs agoAsia",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwype77kwyjo,"Zakir Hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of Indian classical musicwho has died aged 73, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy that will inspire generations.A child prodigy, he collaborated with Indian classical icons like Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, and Shivkumar Sharma and global musicians like John McLaughlin and George Harrison.Born on 9 March, 1951, in Mahim, Mumbai, he was the eldest son of Ustad Allarakha, one of history's most iconic players of the tabla - a pair of traditional Indian hand played drums.Hussain's journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation.Hussain's life revolved around rhythm from the very beginning.The sound of the tabla was his first language, his earliest ""words"". By the age of 12, he was already performing globally, accompanying stalwarts like Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan during his teenage years.While rooted in the Hindustani classical tradition, Hussain possessed an insatiable curiosity that propelled him to explore other genres, leading to ground-breaking collaborations across the world.In 1973, he co-founded Shakti with guitarist John McLaughlin, a group that fused Indian classical music with jazz and Western traditions, creating a new global sound.Over five decades, Shakti evolved, featuring luminaries like violinist L Shankar, percussionist Vikku Vinayakram, and mandolin maestro U Srinivas.Their first studio album in 46 years, This Moment, won the Grammy for Best Global Music Album in 2024, marking a fitting finale to their 50th-anniversary tour. Hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to Shakti's success and to the global appreciation of Indian rhythms. Zakir Hussain's contributions extended far beyond Shakti.He was a key collaborator in Planet Drum and Global Drum Project, both with Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, earning him Grammy Awards in 1991 and 2008.He worked with banjo maestro Béla Fleck and bassist Edgar Meyer on the Grammy-winning As We Speak (2024), further cementing his status as a pioneer of cross-genre collaborations. He also collaborated with musicians as diverse as Yo-Yo Ma, George Harrison, Van Morrison and Billy Cobham, bringing Indian classical music to global audiences.His ventures like Tabla Beat Science, a fusion of Indian classical music with electronic and world music, and orchestral works such asPeshkarfor the Symphony Orchestra of India showcased his unrelenting drive to innovate while respecting his roots.""The moment you think you're a maestro, you are distancing yourself from the others,"" Hussain toldRolling Stone Indiamagazine earlier this year. ""You have to be part of a group, and not dominate it.""This philosophy made him not only a consummate artist but also a lifelong learner and mentor.Hussain's flamboyance and speed and precision of his performances earned him widespread admiration.The New York Times, in its review of a 2009 jazz performance at Carnegie Hall, described his artistry as embodying""an impish strain of virtuosity"".""He's a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. So he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings."" His accolades are as numerous as the beats he crafted.A recipient of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, Hussain was also a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow in the United States. He delighted audiences at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and collaborated with jazz legends, Western classical orchestras, and Carnatic music maestros.Despite his global acclaim, Hussain remained deeply connected to his Indian roots. His early years in a modest chawl - large tenement complexes - in Mahim shaped his values.""For the first three-and-a-half years of my life, we all lived in one room that had no toilet. We had to use the common toilets,"" Hussain told Nasreen Munni Kabir.Offstage, Hussain was an avid reader and a fan of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. He loved poetry, cricket, and tennis, counting Roger Federer among his heroes. His curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like Ravi Shankar and Miles Davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. Hussain would also later say that his TV advert for a popular tea brand - Taj Mahal - ""made me famous in India"".Hussain's death marks the end of an era but leaves an indelible mark on global music. Kabir, who chronicled his life, aptly captured his essence: ""Zakir's extraordinary playing and the extreme sense of rigour he brought to his art made him a phenomenon.""Music for Hussain was not just a career but a spiritual journey - a way to connect with people, traditions, and cultures across the globe.In his final years, Hussain remained as active as ever, performing, mentoring, and composing.""Being a student and having a drive to learn keeps me going. The opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself. Age doesn't affect my energy and drive,"" he said last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jamie Foxx injured in altercation at his birthday dinnerA representative said he ""had to get stitches and is recovering"" after the incident at a Chinese restaurant.1 day agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c140e0pym6lo,"Hollywood actor Jamie Foxx's birthday dinner was cut short after he was involved in an altercation at a Beverly Hills restaurant, leaving him needing stitches, his representative said.The Django Unchained and Ray star was celebrating his 57th birthday on Friday.Someone at another table ""threw a glass that hit him in the mouth"" and the matter is now in ""law enforcement's hands,"" a representative for Foxx told the BBC's US partner CBS News.They added that the actor ""had to get stitches and is recovering"". Officials from Beverly Hills Police Department confirmed police attended Mr Chow, a high-end Chinese restaurant, after reports of an assault with a deadly weapon.Police found there had been a physical fight between two parties at the restaurant, and that reports of assault with a deadly weapon were unfounded. They did not elaborate on what sparked the fight.The representative told CBS News Los Angeles that Foxx was at the restaurant for a celebration, even though police did not specifically name him.The police were called around 10:10 p.m.It's unclear whether any arrests have been made and no other information was provided.The incident comes after Foxx revealedthe cause of his hospital admission in April last year.Speaking during a Netflix special earlier this month, the actor told the audience he'd suffered a ""brain bleed that led to a stroke"".He said he had a bad headache one day and asked for an aspirin, but before he could take it he ""went out (blacked out). I don't remember 20 days"".At the time, his daughter Corinne Foxx said he had experienced a ""medical complication"" but the family did not share details about his health issues.The star won an Oscar for best actor for playing musician Ray Charles in Ray in 2005. He was also nominated for best supporting actor the same year for his role in Collateral.His other films include Baby Driver, Annie and The Amazing Spider-Man 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Christmas number one race - and how to win itAll Mariah and Wham! want for Christmas is a chart-topper. Can a newcomer like Tom Grennan stop them?2 days agoCulture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg6ejq7zpyo,"This year's Christmas number one single will be unwrapped on Friday, with a mixture of old favourites, new efforts and wild cards all in the running.Last year, Wham! classic Last Christmastopped the yuletide singles chart,remarkably for the first time since its release in 1984, when the original Band Aid kept it off the number one spot.As is tradition, the festive number one will be announced on BBC Radio 1's chart show from 16:00 GMT on the Friday before Christmas.At the time of writing, a stocking full of artists - naughty and nice - are hoping to top the list. Wham!'s hit is the frontrunner after reclaiming the top spot in the last chart before the Christmas one, as people streamed it to get into the festive spirit. It has also been reissued on CD and 12-inch vinyl for its 40th anniversary for the final week of the chart race, giving it a further boost.Another seasonal staple,Mariah Carey'sAll I Want for Christmas, is not far behind.Also in this year's mix areBrenda Lee's golden oldie Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and the latest incarnation ofBand Aid.They're joined by a new festive tune byTom Grennan, while songs byAriana GrandeandKelly Clarksonhave established themselves as returning Christmas classics.Or the chart crown could go to something non-Christmassy - like recent hits byGracie Abrams,RoseandBruno Mars, or the fast-risingLola Young.There was a long period when the Christmas number one was reserved for the latest X Factor winner - seven times between 2005-14 - or novelty charity-fundraising sausage-roll enthusiast LadBaby, a five-time victor between 2018-22.And just like with buying gifts, the key for any artists involved now, according to Official Chart Company boss Martin Talbot, is to step into Christmas with confidence and a strategy, and to go early. ""The singles market is very much dominated by streaming these days, in general terms, throughout the year,"" he says.""But the Christmas market is the one market where you can sell a lot of physical [copies and] a lot of downloads and actually make a big difference. Because people want to buy gifts.""That's where Wham! will do really well this year.""Physical or download sales count for much more than streams in the chart in the digital era. ""The other thing is, if you've got a charity record, let's not be shy about it,"" Talbot notes.That's an adage not lost on Bob Geldof and the Band Aid team, who are going again with their own 40th anniversary Ultimate Mix, which has made headlines this timeafter Ed Sheeran saidhe would have preferred for his vocals not to have been used again because of the song's portrayal of Africa.""When people engage with charity records, they're not doing it because they specifically want to listen to the charity record over and over again, Talbot notes.""Streaming doesn't really work."" Instead, he says: ""It's all about voting. And you cast your vote by buying a download or by buying physical products.""East 17,Reverend and the MakersandThe Celebsare all also having a go in aid of various charities this year, as areSouth Yorkshire Fire & Rescue. Mariah's slow-burning 1994 anthem finally topped the UK chart for the first time in 2020,returning to the summit in 2022.Yet despite it being screeched by revellers across the country every December, the unofficial queen of Christmas (her bid to trademark that moniker was denied by US authorities)has never been at the top of the UK chart in Christmas week itself.""It was the first Christmas song I ever wrote and I was just thinking about all the things that I really did want at Christmas,"" sherecently told Rylan in a BBC interview.""I guess I turned it into, if there's something that you love, it means more than all that stuff."" Aww.Her tune, like Wham!'s and Band Aid's, has benefitted from being heavily promoted by streaming services like Spotify, Apple and Amazon on their top Christmas playlists. In recent years, Amazon has thrown its might behind new Christmas songs that are exclusive to its service. They have included Sam Ryder's You're Christmas To Me, which narrowly lost out to Wham! last year, and Ellie Goulding's River, which topped the chart just after Christmas in 2019.This year, Grennan's soulful, lovelorn It Can't Be Christmas is only available via Amazon Music.Grennan, who actually penned the track in Los Angeles in the summer, said it was a ""no-brainer"" for him to team up with the streamer to create his own festive song.Amazon has also commissioned Icelandic-Chinese singer-songwriterLaufey's Christmas Magic.She said being asked to come up with an original to go up against the usual suspects was ""such a fun challenge"".The classically-trained star's jazzy number features in Red One, a holiday-themed action movie starring Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans and Lucy Liu - and made by Amazon. Chart expert James Masterson says the Christmas number one race began as an invention of British bookmakers in 1984.While it used to produce many bona fide pop hits, he believes the concept has been ""ruined"" in recent years, not least by the admittedly well-intentioned LadBaby.""It became pointless speculating as to what was going to be Christmas number one,"" he says of the LadBaby era.""Which is why, when he didn't release a song last year, it left this void and it was a void that nobody came along to fill.""Last Christmas ""won by default"", he says, because it appears at the top of all the Christmas playlists playing ""the same old songs, every single year, in much the same order"". Due to a crowded Christmas market, Masterson says many record labels began to feel it's not worth worrying about the end of year chart any more.Chart rules dictate that songs released in the last three years are weighted more favourably than those already in the Christmas canon.But even with that factor in their favour, he feels it is increasingly difficult for artists with genuinely good new seasonal songs to ""achieve enough momentum"" to ""get lucky"".""My view is that if Last Christmas by Wham! gets the Christmas number one again by default, it would be a disaster for the whole concept,"" he concludes.So anyone launching a late bid - be it fans of the lateLiam Payne, Liberal Democrat leaderEd DaveyorYorkshire Pudding Boy-will probably require a cracking campaign.There have been upsets in the past - fans ofRage Against the Machine's Killing in the Nameput a small-but-welcome dint in the X Factor monopoly in 2009. Talbot thinks that ifSheeran really ""wanted to really go for it"" with Under The Tree, his song from Richard Curtis's That Christmas movie, he could challenge Wham! and  Mariah.Alternatively, the ""Wicked phenomenon could be really powerful"", meaningCynthia Ervivoand Grande's Defying Gravity could pull off a ""surprise"" as families and friends head for outings to the cinema.US pop sensationSabrina Carpenterhas released a Christmas-centric EP, Fruitcake, which could top the festive album chart, but its tracks don't seem to be in the running for the singles crown.So it's beginning to look a lot like Wham! will be Christmas number one again - just like last Christmas.This year's Christmas Number 1 will be revealed on 20 December on theOfficial Chart on Radio with Jack Saunders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Wanted singer needs urgent heart-block surgery12 mins agoCulture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4xl549v5go,"Max George, of boy band The Wanted, has said he needs surgery for a heart condition, ""way quicker than the doctors first thought"".Taken into hospital on Wednesday, the singer, 36, had a scan on Monday and then posted: ""We don't have too much time to wait.""He had been diagnosed with ""a 2:1 block in my heart"", George said, wherethe heart beats more slowly or with an abnormal rhythmbecause of a problem with the electrical pulses.It was ""a pretty scary time right now and the last few nights have been really rough"" but he hoped to be out of hospital by Christmas. George's message was accompanied by a series of photos and a video of him on a hospital trolley, with wires attached to his chest, and giving the thumbs up. ""Had a little day trip today,"" he wrote, ""full Cat scan on my heart - not something I'd choose to do again.""As I mentioned yesterday, I have a 2:1 block in my heart.""Unfortunately, my heart rate hasn't picked up at all in almost a week.""Because of this, we don't have too much time to wait.""So it looks like I'm going to be in surgery way quicker than the doctors first thought.""I may even be home for Christmas.""Still a pretty scary time right now and the last few nights have been really rough.""But I wanted to say that I'm absolutely humbled by all your messages of support - both people I know and those I don't.""It's given me a much-needed boost and my family have been overwhelmed with support, which means more to me than anything. Much love, Max."" In a separate video, posted on Sunday, George told followers the scan would determine whether he needed ""a pacemaker, a defibrillator or something else"".""It's the top part not sending signals to the bottom, apparently,"" he said.He was ""feeling OK tonight"", George said in Sunday's video, adding: ""The City game didn't help much,"" in a reference to Manchester City's dramatic late defeat to rivals Manchester United.The British Heart Foundation saysan atrioventricular heart block is when the electrical impulses are delayed or blocked as they travel between the atria (the top chambers of the heart) and the ventricles (the bottom chambers).Heart blocks are graded as first, second or third degree, depending on severity. George rose to fame in the early 2010s, with bandmates Siva Kaneswaran, Nathan Sykes, Jay McGuiness and Tom Parker.The Wanted announced a break in 2014 - and in 2022, George and Kaneswaran relaunched as a duo.George also appeared in Strictly Come Dancing, in 2020.Parker died from brain cancer, aged 33, in March 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robbie Williams on why he's played by a chimp in new film17 hrs agoCulture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7r21egd82o,"Robbie Williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo.""I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,"" the singer says.He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig.""I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.""The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man.""Kevin Costner sought me out,"" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: ""He wanted to come and tell me about the movie."" Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two).The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party. Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence.Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman.Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey. For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.""There have been a lot of musical biopics,"" says Gracey. ""I wanted to come at this with a different lens.""Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'.""It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.""And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'""Williams takes up the story: ""I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'""I went, 'Monkey?'""And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'."" The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey.""I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,"" he says. ""And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.""There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.'""And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'"" Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022.""We also scanned his eyes,"" explains Gracey, ""So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.""""I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,"" interrupts Williams.""I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film.""Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic."" Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as ""the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation"".And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion.""My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,"" Williams admits.""She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend."" Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years.In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family.""He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,"" says Williams.""I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man.""But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up."" The film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That.""There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,"" is his summary.""I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.""The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.""It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,"" he says.""It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.""But these plans will have to wait. At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars.Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.)In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric ""Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing"".How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards.And there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination.""Best visual effects,"" starts Gracey, before Williams interjects once more.""Best musical monkey!"" he beams.Gracey laughs. ""If that was a category, we would definitely win.""Hollywood is indeed starting to listen.Better Man opens in cinema on 26 December.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2 hrs agoGrenfell families complain to architect regulatorThe Good Law Project has complained over architects involved in the Grenfell Tower refurbishment.2 hrs agoLondon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx9574ew07o,"The families of three people who died in the Grenfell Tower fire are supporting a letter of complaint to a regulator about the architects involved in the block's refurbishment.The Good Law Project delivered a letter of complaint to the Architects Registration Board (ARB) which accused Studio E of being negligent in its role and said it should be held accountable.Apublic inquiry previously found architectural firm Studio E bore ""a very significant degree of responsibilityfor the disaster"" in 2017, in which 72 people died.The ARB said formal investigations began after phase two of the inquiry concluded, but it did not comment on the details of investigations. Studio E isin the process of being liquidatedand the BBC has attempted to approach representatives for comment.The Good Law Project was joined by the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) on Monday to deliver the letter, and said if the complaint is upheld it hoped to set a precedent enabling other residents of buildings with dangerous cladding to file a complaint against their architects with the ARB.It added the families ofAmna Mahmoud Idris, Amal Ahmedin and three-year-old Amaya Tuccu-Ahmedin, all of whom died on the 19th floor of Grenfell Tower, supported the group's efforts and submitted a statement saying while the architects ""may be held to account today... we, the bereaved families, will have to live with their mistakes for the rest of our lives"". Their statement read: ""These architects were responsible for the architectural safety of our and our families' homes.""Yet none of their partners or employees had the relevant knowledge, experience or skills needed to work on a high-rise cladding project.""They let us and our loved ones down.""The Good Law Project said it also gained support for its letter from the Grenfell Community Campaigners.Bekah Sparrow, legal manager at the Good Law Project, said: ""It's been seven and a half years since the fire and those architects are still on the register, we haven't seen any action from the regulator at all."" ""We're really hoping the registration board takes robust action. In practical terms they can issue a reprimand, fine, suspension - they can even strike architects off the register,"" Ms Sparrow continued.""We've got unsafe cladding up and down the country, so many people living in unsafe buildings and we need them to know, architects to know, that the registration board does take action when there's information in the public domain that seriously questions whether things have gone as they should have done."" Matt Wrack, general secretary at the FBU, said: ""One of the things we've said from day one is that the Grenfell Tower tragedy represents a complete failure of regulation in this country in terms of building safety, and that's at the heart of everything that went wrong.""If anyone reads the findings of the report and the evidence given in the inquiry, there was a complete failure in terms of the planning of that redevelopment, how it was done who was allowed to do it - and that needs to be challenged.""I think the architects are exposed in the evidence that was heard at the inquiry and in the findings of the inquiry as a firm who had no experience or knowledge of that type of work... and they need to be held to account for that, and the regulation of architects needs to be better enforced."" An ARB spokesperson said following phase two of the inquiry, formal investigations began ""into whether any architects involved in the refurbishment of the tower might be guilty of a disciplinary offence under the Architects Code"".""The investigations must be conducted properly if they are to be effective, and can be complex, particularly when they take place in the background of potential criminal proceedings which must not be prejudiced,"" they added.""It is ARB's policy to not comment on the detail of investigations until or unless they reach a public hearing of our professional conduct committee, so that the committee can make an independent decision based on the evidence available.""

Ms Harper said they were ""all amazing bands and we are so thankful to them for playing and so hopefully we will get a few people down to see that"".The venue was ""looking a little bit shabby at the moment"", she said, and the aim was to repair the damage and improve the exterior, for nearby residents and guests, with new signage and planters.""You can see a lot of our cladding and our old windows through it now and it's just getting a bit dangerous and it's actually affecting all our bookings now,"" Ms Harper added.She said some couples who had met at the venue wanted to get married there, but the condition of the building ""puts a lot of people off"".Ms Harper said the ""amazing"" funding from the Veolia Trust would cover a lot of the work but the terms included the venue contributed £10,000 to complete the project.She added it was very important to preserve The Tin, especially as many music venues were being closed nationally.The Tin held many gigs, supported grassroots music and ran projects, including Live on Stage which helped senior school-aged children get into music and try out workshops, Ms Harper explained.""We just need our front to reflect the amazing stuff that goes on inside.""

"4 hrs agoPaddington firm lists in UK to protect British bearThe boss of Canal+ says the bear will stay ""close to his roots"" as the firm begins trading in London.4 hrs agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c390zve2ejzo,"Paddington will not be Americanised for US audiences, the boss of the firm behind the film franchise has pledged.""This is the most British bear… it has appealed to a lot of people because it is authentic,"" said Canal+ chief executive Maxime Saada.The news comes as the the French streaming company, which owns the film rights to the iconic British bear, began trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday.Chancellor Rachel Reeves has described it as a ""vote of confidence"" in the London market, which has struggled to attract new business in recent years. Canal+ is being spun off from the Vivendi media stable, and is reported to be planning further global expansion from its new London base. Mr Saada told the BBC: ""We got some feedback from American companies that Paddington the bear is not American enough.""To maximise the Paddington box office, we could have made an American movie.""But he said the British bear's heritage would be preserved.""This is really our most prized intellectual property... we are very careful about being very close to its roots and authentic.""Canal+ is behind streaming hits such as Versailles and its subsidiary StudioCanal owns the rights to an array of movies including Total Recall, the Shaun the Sheep and Bridget Jones franchises, and more recently the Amy Winehouse biopic, Back to Black, as well as the three films featuring the marmalade-munching bear.The latest Paddington film, released last month, shows the bear and his adopted British family returning to his roots in Peru amid a trail of mishaps.Mr Saada said Paddington 4 was ""certainly not coming tomorrow"" but confirmed that the company is working on a follow-up and an animated series. Canal+ operates in 50 countries and has 27 million subscribers, two thirds of whom are outside of France.The firm's London listing comes after years of concerns over the exchange's lacklustre performance, with companies such as the construction group Ashstead and microchip designer Arm leaving to list overseas. Others have opted to go private.The London Stock Exchange is set for itsworst year for departures since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Some 88 companies have delisted or transferred their primary listing from London's main market, with only 18 taking their place.Economists say a thriving stock market is important for boosting the economy because it helps businesses raise money by allowing them to sell shares.This gives companies the funds they need to borrow and invest in new projects, create jobs, and expand, which in turn drives economic growth.Mr Saada has said the new flexibility in rules for LSE and the UK's strong creative industry played a role persuading him to choose London.""We have suddenly aroused a lot of curiosity from American investors, from British investors, from investors all over the world and we don't think this could have happened by listing anywhere else in the European territory.""""We have a long history of working with the creative industries here in the UK and that's also very important to us.""The flotation is expected to value the firm at up to €6bn (£5bn).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carter-J said he was shocked to be offered the part of Harry Plat in Coronation Street earlier this year, and said people around his hometown had started recognising him in the street.His mother Abbie said: ""Being from Manchester anyway, you grow up watching Coronation Street, so when your child gets cast as one of the Platts, it's just crazy.""I am really, really proud of him.""Carter-J said he enjoyed playing the younger Williams as ""I am more like him"", adding the experience of attending the premiere was great as there was ""loads and loads of famous people"".When it comes to acting, he said he aimed to ""just think what I would feel if I was Robbie, what would he feel like, will he feel this way in this situation.""The 10-year-old said he now had two weeks off filming Coronation Street for Christmas, and was looking forward to enjoying some downtime after a busy year.

1 day agoAmbulance dispatcher releases second singleAaron Wilkes released Stand Together in September and The Adventure was released this week.1 day agoStoke & Staffordshire,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dxejyzj9go,"An ambulance worker who wrote and recorded a single in his front room to support male mental health, after he went through a tough time himself, has released his second track.In September, Aaron Wilkes released Stand Together, and his next song, The Adventure, was released this week.The 38-year-old, who has worked as a West Midlands ambulance control room dispatcher for 18 years, surprised his colleagues with his first single after keeping his talent under wraps.He is now forming a band to perform live, but said his music would remain a hobby, because he loves his job. He said he recorded and produced the original song in his front room in Stafford, with a little help from his father.He said he wanted to create a song to boost mental health because of music's ability to change the way we feel and make us think.""Rather than slow and depressing, it was uplifting and powerful,"" he said. ""That was the intent.""People who heard it messaged him directly to say thank you, he added. ""They were complete strangers. What impact it had on them, I don't know. I'm just pleased it did.""It was released on 28 September, ahead of Men's Health Awareness Month in November.He wrote the song to help himself through a tough time and help others as well, he said.It went on to be played on 15 radio stations and has been listened to more than 9,000 times. The Adventure has a Celtic theme with a hint of Christmas, he said.""It's not just a Christmas song though, you can play it all year round,"" he added.""It's not so much about mental health. This is aimed at people setting out on a new adventure, maybe in a relationship, or a new connection, or networks - just to feel on top of the world.""He said while the duet with fellow musician Freya Butlin is about new adventures, he will not be starting a new career.""It's a hobby,"" he said. ""I love working for the ambulance service. I've been there 18 years and I don't intend to change.""Both songs have raised money for charity.A spokeswoman for the ambulance service said: ""Aaron's passion for helping others means that, once more, 100% of the royalties from his new song will go to MAAC (Midlands Air Ambulance Charity) and TASC (The Ambulance Staff Charity).""

"2 days agoBollywood superstar on why he secretly quit filmsAamir Khan had decided to leave the film industry during the pandemic, but is now back and hoping to make history at the Oscars.2 days agoCulture",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70883g2kzno,"Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan is known for some of India's most popular films, including Lagaan and 3 Idiots.So great is his appeal, he can barely walk down the street without getting mobbed by fans.What's less well known is that he secretly quit films during the Covid pandemic in order to spend more time with his loved ones.""I told my family I'm done with acting and films,"" he tells BBC News.""I [didn't] want to produce or direct or act. I just wanted to be with the family.""You'd imagine a major star like Khan deciding to quit the industry would have sent shockwaves through India, a nation that is fully obsessed with films.But, he explains, his decision went unnoticed at the time because so few movies were being made due to the pandemic.""No-one knew about it,"" he says. Fans can breathe a sigh of relief, though.Khan didn't quit for long. And now he's back and is promoting Laapataa Ladies - or Lost Ladies - a film he's produced. It is India's official pick for the Oscars in the best international feature film category.Khan says it was his children who convinced him to go back to work.""They were like, 'But we can't spend 24 hours with you. So get real and get a life.' So they gently nudged me back into the films,"" he says. Can zombies and witches save Bollywood from its troubles?Nostalgic Indians flock to cinemas to watch old hitsAlia Bhatt: The young Bollywood star taking on Hollywood At 59, Khan has worked as an actor, director and producer for three decades.He's known as one of the three ""Khans of Bollywood"" - the others being fellow megastars Shah Rukh and Salman.Known for tackling social issues, Aamir's films are widely acclaimed as well as breaking box office records.He is also no stranger to the Oscars. Lagaan, a film about cricket set in the 19th Century during the British Empire, was nominated for best foreign language film in 2002.Khan is now trying to make history with Laapataa Ladies. If it succeeds, it would be the first Indian film to win the coveted international prize. He will find out whether it has made the shortlist on Tuesday.Khan said he's ""not quite sure how seriously"" to take awards. ""Cinema is so subjective,"" he says.But he admits a win would mean a lot to India. ""I think Indians are so film crazy and we've been dying to win the Academy Award for an Indian film, which hasn't happened till now. So the country will go ballistic. They'll just go mad if we win,"" he says.""So just for the people of our country and for our country, I would be really happy if we win the award.""Set in rural India, Laapataa Ladies tells the story of a young man bringing the wrong bride home. Meanwhile, his wife ends up lost, having to fend for herself.It's a satire looking at the treatment of women, including touching on the sensitive topic of domestic violence.Khan describes the plot as ""a bit Shakespearean"", with its focus on humour and mistaken identities.But, he adds, it's saying ""a lot of important things about women's issues, their independence, their right to decide for themselves what they want to do"".It was these issues that drew him to the film in the first place, he explains.""Every now and then you get an opportunity as a creative person to actually also sensitise people about certain issues that we face in society,"" he says.""Women all over the world have been subjected to a lot of challenges in their lives. Women have a raw deal in life. So I felt that here is a story which really brings that out well in such a nice way, which is why I wanted to produce it."" Khan was also ""very keen"" that his ex-wife, Kiran Rao, should direct the film.The pair, who married in 2005, announced their separation in 2021. But they have remained close, both professionally and personally.""I think the reason I chose Kiran was because I knew that she would be very honest with it and that's what I wanted,"" he says.""We get along really well. We really love each other, we respect each other.""Our relationship may have changed slightly – but that doesn't mean what we feel for each other has gone down or something.""That's not to say it's all been plain sailing, however.Khan admits there were arguments on set.""We can't make a film without an argument. So we argue every point and we have strong opinions,"" he says.""But our sensibilities are very similar. We are not talking about fundamental things. We are just trying to sometimes convince the other person a better way of conveying something."" Bollywood produces hundreds of films every year and has a huge following among Indians globally.The sway the films and stars have on their fans' imagination cannot be overstated.It has had recent success at the Academy Awards, with Naatu Naatu from RRR winning best original song and The Elephant Whisperers awarded best documentary short film.But victory in the international film category has so far eluded it, something Khan attributes to the competition.""India has made really great films over the years. Occasionally it's a matter of the right film not getting sent or the best film not getting sent,"" he says.""But otherwise we have to understand that the films you're competing against - you're not competing against five or six films, you're competing against almost 80 or 90 films, which are the best in the world.""As to whether a Bollywood film could one day scoop the best overall film award, Khan says it is ""possible"".But Indian film-makers would first need to start making movies for a global market, he adds.""I've never really looked at an international audience,"" he says. ""We have such a large audience of our own that it doesn't come in to our mind.""That will only happen when Indians start making films for a world audience. I don't think we have the bandwidth for it right now."" For now, Khan is focusing on a range of projects alongside Laapataa Ladies, which also include his next film Sitaare Zameen Par, due for release in 2025.Looking further out, he's hoping to make one film a year, while his ""dream project"" is to take on Mahabharat - the ancient Indian epic.But since unretiring from film, he is determined to do things differently. Again, this was influenced by his children.""My son said, 'You're an extreme person',"" he says.""He said, 'You're like a pendulum. You only did films, films, films. And now you want to swing to the other side and do no films and be with family, family, family. There is a middle place also you can think about'.""Khan says his son told him to ""try and bring some balance"" into his life.""And I thought he was right. So since then, that's what I've been trying to do - living a balanced life where I'm working really hard, in fact I'm doing much more work that I ever did, but I don't work after 6 o'clock any more.""Khan says he has also started therapy in recent years, inspired by his daughter Ira, who works in mental health.""I think that's something that's really helped me.

"Nato must switch to a wartime mindset, warns secretary generalMark Rutte urged members to ""turbocharge"" their defence spending to prevent future war with Russia.4 days agoEurope",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly41x7eg71o,"The head of Nato has said it is time to ""shift to a wartime mindset"", as he warned the military alliance's members were not spending enough to prepare for the threat of a future conflict with Russia.Secretary general Mark Rutte said Moscow was ""preparing for long-term confrontation with Ukraine and with us"", describing the current security situation as the worst in his lifetime.""We are not ready for what is coming our way in four to five years,"" he said in his first major speech since becoming secretary general in October, urging members to ""turbocharge"" their defence spending.His comments come weeks before president-elect Donald Trump takes office, havingpreviously suggestedthe US would not protect Nato allies that were failing to spend enough on defence. Nato members have pledged to spend at least 2% of the value of their economies - measured by GDP - on defence per year by 2024.But speaking at an event in Brussels, the former Dutch prime minister said ""a lot more"" would be needed as danger ""[moves] towards us at full speed"".He said European members had spent upwards of 3% of GDP on defence during the Cold War.""If we don't spend more together now to prevent war, we will pay a much, much, much higher price later to fight it,"" he said.He added that Russia's economy was ""on a war footing"", with its defence spend by 2025 set to be ""a third of Russia's state budget – and the highest level since the Cold War"".Russia has significantly increased its defence spending since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with record levels approved for 2025.Rutte spoke ata critical juncture in the war in Ukraine,with Russian forces grinding forward in the east of the country. By November, Moscow had seized six times as much Ukrainian territory in 2024compared with the whole of 2023.While the average defence spend for Nato members in Europe and Canada is estimated at 2%, not all meet the target.Trump said in February that he would""encourage"" Russia to attack any Nato member that fails to pay its billsas part of the Western military alliance.Nato's 32 members in Europe and North America agree that if one member is attacked, the others should help defend them. Speaking to the BBC following his speech on Thursday, Rutte said: ""Donald Trump was completely right when in his first term he forced us to spend more, he was successful, we are considerably spending more than before he became president, so in that sense he was totally right.""This is why some in Nato call Rutte ""The Trump Whisperer"". And that, they say, is a very big reason he was chosen as Nato secretary general.Back in 2018, then President Trump famously threatened the US would ""go our own way"" if other Nato members - essentially in Europe - did not spend more on their own militaries. Then Dutch Prime Minister Rutte was credited with reasoning with the US president, assuring him that spending had already gone up and that he, President Trump, was the reason for it.And now Trump is poised to return to the White House and Rutte wants to keep the US committed to Nato and European defence. So Rutte's messaging to Trump is once again to flatter him.As a former prime minister, Rutte well knows that Europe's leaders hesitate to spend much more on defence because voters across the continent have other priorities - rising living costs, health, migration.That, he told the BBC, is why he aimed his speech today as his ""plea"" to ""people"".""I'm really pleading directly to the one billion people living in Nato territory, and particularly in Canada and Europe, to ask them to help me,"" Rutte said.""Call up your politicians, tell them that you agree that yes it is difficult, it will mean somewhat less spending on some other items, but that you want them, your politicians, to prioritise defence, because this is long-term crucial…""My plea here is if you have children, grandchildren, if you think our way of life should be preserved, the democracy, our values, then we have to prioritise defence.""And if we don't, in four or five years we are in real difficulty.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia launches huge attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructureThe Kremlin says the strikes were in response to Kyiv using US-made missiles to attack its territory.3 days agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0xw05k7z1o,"Russia has launched a huge attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which authorities said was the 12th large-scale attack on energy facilities this year.Ninety-three missiles and more than 200 drones were used - but 81 of the missiles were shot down, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.The strikes targeted sites in western Ukraine, damaging energy facilities in several regions, some seriously. Authorities in Ivano-Frankivsk said it was the worst attack on the region so far.Moscow said the attack was in response to a Ukrainian strike on a military airbase in south-west Russia using US-made missiles. In an interview with Time magazine on Thursday,to mark being named Person of the Year, US President-elect Donald Trump said he disagreed ""very vehemently"" with American-made missiles targeting sites in Russia and branded it ""crazy"".""We're just escalating this war and making it worse,"" he said.On Friday, the Kremlin said that Trump's comments were ""fully aligned"" with Moscow's position.""That impresses us,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""It is obvious that Trump understands exactly what is escalating the situation.""Trump also told Time he wanted to reach an agreement to end the war, and the only way to do that was ""not to abandon"". Last month, US President Joe Biden allowed Ukraine to use US-made ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia.The first attacks using the long-range missiles occurred the following day, with Russian authoritiesstating at the time that the Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine, had been hit.Kyiv had been using ATACMS missilessince October 2023, but only on Russian-held targets within Ukrainian territory. Russia's attacks came on the coldest day of the Ukrainian winter so far, with temperatures around -6C.Along with the damage caused in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, energy and infrastructure facilities were damaged in the Lviv and Ternopil regions.No critical or residential infrastructure was hit in the Kyiv region, according to Ruslan Kravchenko, the area's governor.Five out of the country's nine operating nuclear reactor units have been operating with reduced power.As a result of the attack, the Ukrenergo National Power Company had to increase power supply restrictions on Friday, with rolling blackouts being introduced in all regions.Ukrenergo added that during the day on Friday, electricity would be imported from Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In total, Russia has captured and retaken about 2,350 sq km of territory (907 sq miles) in eastern Ukraine and in Russia's western Kursk region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The woman helping amputees rebuild their lives in war-torn UkraineOlga Rudnieva is supporting Ukrainian soldiers who have lost limbs in the front line to return from injury even stronger.6 days agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q0wvyqzwdo,"Serhiy Petchenko lost both hands while defending Ukraine from Russian invaders in June 2023.After surviving the bitter months-long battle for the city of Bakhmut, his injury came in a railway incident further from the front line.It left the 42-year-old feeling helpless and in despair. After the amputations, his wife, Anna, had to remain by his side 24/7 for six months.""What helped us survive is our love,"" says Serhiy.But it's hard to believe he went through such an ordeal when you see him now, standing on the doorstep of a brand-new café, which he is about to open in Lviv, in the west of Ukraine.He smiles widely, his arms - and hands - by his side.Serhiy received two prosthetic hands and full rehabilitation at the Superhumans Center, a private clinic for people with war injuries, located outside the city.At the same time, the couple received the training they needed to open a family business.Serhiy says the centre gave him a chance to return normal life, while learning to live with a new disability. At least 50,000 Ukrainians have lost limbs in nearly three years of war according to the Ukrainian Health Ministry - both soldiers and civilians.""Some people have double, triple, quadruple amputations. All these people will need prosthetics, or some will use wheelchairs,"" says Olga Rudnieva, CEO and co-founder of the Superhumans Center.Many amputations are the result of delays in evacuation from the battlefield. The barrage of incoming fire can be so intense that it may take many hours to get a wounded soldier to hospital.With more than one million people on the front line, Rudnieva says, Ukraine will become ""the country of people with disabilities"".""We want to normalise disability. OK, that's how the country is going to look,"" she says, describing the thinking behind her centre.""Most of the people here at the centre shouldn't be alive. The fact that they are is a miracle in itself."" Rudnieva co-founded the centre amid the Russian missile attacks that have rained down on the country since February 2022. Some people called her ""crazy"" but she went ahead anyway.""If I have an opinion, I'm sharing my opinion. If I know what to do, I just go and do it,"" she says.Her partners and team raised funds all over the world for high-quality prosthetics and reconstructive surgery. Her passionate presentation, explaining how injuries can be empowering, turned some celebrities into Superhumans supporters, including British adventurer Bear Grylls, Virgin boss Richard Branson, singer Sting and actress Trudie Styler.""We truly believe that you can be empowered by trauma. The trauma can ruin you or it can build your superpower,"" she says.The Superhumans Center supplements Ukraine's military hospitals and clinics, which are overloaded with the constant flow of wounded soldiers from the 3,200km long front line.Since it opened in April 2023, more than 1,000 patients have received treatment here - both military and civilian, adults and children. Almost 800 of them have received prosthetic limbs.""It's the global headquarters of resilience,"" says 47-year-old Rudnieva. walking energetically between patients' wheelchairs. BBC 100 Womennames 100 inspiring and influential women around the world every year - Olga Rudnieva is on the 2024 list.Meet this year's 100 Women here They are waiting for modern prosthetics or are already practising to use their new limbs.She asks some of the young men around, with double and triple amputations, to show her what they have learnt so far.Ukrainian soldiers use callsigns instead of names, and Rudnieva has one too - ""Mum"".""They learned to walk with their mothers, and I was the second person they learned how to walk with,"" she says proudly.At the start of the war, Ukraine was not ready to support so many people with disabilities.""Ukrainian soldiers are less afraid to be killed than to be wounded, because a severe injury means you are going to be disabled for the rest of your life – and the infrastructure is not right, and society is not ready, and the healthcare system is not right,"" says Rudnieva.A few times a day she visits the rehabilitation room where the ""superhumans"", as she calls them, are learning to walk again.Among the battle-hardened men is gentle Olena, a bakery manager from the city of Kostiantynivka in eastern Ukraine. She lost her leg in a Russian rocket strike on the way to her mum's birthday party. ""The first thing I'll do when I have my artificial leg, if the weather is fine, is just go for a walk. Without any rush, without an aim. I'll just take a walk to recall how it feels,"" she says.At present she uses a leg that belongs to the rehabilitation room, but soon she will have one of her own.Rudnieva remembers Olena's story in detail, and the stories of her other patients.She knows about their wives and husbands, parents and pre-war jobs. ""Younger guys bring me their girlfriends and ask my opinion,"" she says, with a smile.Couples have even come came to her before taking a decision on whether to divorce or not.A severe war injury is a challenge not just for the survivor, but for his or her entire family, and it tests relationships.Showing the newly equipped children's room, Rudnieva smiles.""We are waiting today for Nazarchyk, Serhiy and Anna's son. He is so active. He will turn it upside down.""Rudnieva says that her work has taught her to value life as never before, and also to stop fearing death. Once a director of the Olena Pinchuk Foundation, working to halt the spread of HIV/Aids across Ukraine, she was abroad when Russia invaded. For a few months she ran a humanitarian aid hub in Poland, then she returned to Ukraine and founded her life-changing project.She wasn't the only one. Ukrainian civil society quickly rallied round, both to support the war effort - fundraising for drones and vehicles, importing medical equipment or clothing - and to keep society going while the country fought for its life.There are now other private rehabilitation centres, ambulances and taxis that help evacuate people from half-destroyed towns, food services for refugees, and many other initiatives that supplement services provided by the state.And women have played a key role.""When the full-scale invasion started, I, as a feminist, was very scared. I thought that it's the end of feminism, because war is a very masculine thing,"" Rudnieva says.But later on she realised that women have taken over many responsibilities as men have gone away to fight, as well as in some cases becoming fighters too.""I think that women proved to be absolutely amazing during this war,"" says Rudnieva, as some of her words are drowned out by sirens - part of the soundtrack of Ukraine's new life.

Prison boss killed in car blast in occupied UkraineSergei Yevsyukov's death is being seen as the latest in a series of attacks on Russian officers.7 days agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y867penn8o,"The former head of a notorious prison in Russian-occupied Ukraine has reportedly been killed in a car blast in Donetsk, in what is being seen as the latest in a series of attacks on pro-Kremlin figures in occupied land.Ukrainian media say that Sergei Yevsyukov, 49, was killed in a blast from an explosive device planted under his car, with one outlet reporting that the bomb was equivalent to about 100g of TNT.Yevsyukov was chief of the Olenivka Prison when dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of wardied in a missile strike in July 2022.Russia blamed Ukraine for that attack but Ukraine said Russia had targeted the prison to destroy evidence of torture and other war crimes committed there. On Monday, Russian authorities said they had opened a criminal investigation into the incident which took place near the city's centre.They did not confirm identities but said two local residents had been injured.Ukrainian bloggers reported Yevsyukov's wife had also been injured in the attack, losing a leg, and was in hospital on a critical condition.""[We] are conducting a detailed examination of the scene of the incident and a set of operational and investigative measures,"" the Russian Investigations Committee said.Footage of the scene shows the burnt-out white SUV parked on a main street in Donestsk.Yevsyukov's killing is being seen as the latest in a string of targeted attacks by Ukraine on Russian officers, Russian-installed military officials and pro-Kremlin public figures in occupied Ukrainian territory and in Russia.In November, a senior naval officer Valery Trankovsky who had been accused of war crimes by Ukraine was killed in Crimea. Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.Trankovsky's assassination was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence, AFP news agency reported last month citing a source in Ukraine's security services.In October, Ukraine claimed responsibility for a car bomb attack that killed an official at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.And in April, a car bomb in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region killed a Moscow-appointed government official.Donetsk city and parts of the wider region in eastern Ukraine were first seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014, and the area has been partially controlled by Moscow ever since.The region has consistently seen some of the fiercest fighting of the war these past nearly three years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Artists imagine a new utopia for Kenya's capitalCreatives in Nairobi unleash their imaginations in an effort to inspire a new future for the city.30 Nov 2024Africa,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4vk5y4ng5o,"Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, has long been known as “the green city in the sun” because of its mix of forest and grasslands among the urban sprawl, but it all depends on where you are viewing it from.Seen from one of the city’s comfortable apartment blocks or homes, then yes, perhaps – from one of its densely packed slums, then no.There, life can be characterised by poverty and ecological disaster, such as flooding and deadly landslides.But an art collective - Kairos Futura – has been trying to take what might seem like some of the city’s more dystopian elements and create a vision of a utopia, or at least how that might be achieved.Their exhibition Hakuna Utopia features the works of seven artists exploring themes of apocalypse and resilience – some in quite abstract ways - as they respond to the daily challenges endured by Nairobi’s six million residents. One of the collective, Stoneface Bombaa, grew up in Mathare, the capital’s second-largest informal settlement.He has overcome great odds to become an artist and wants to use his work to address the way that people in Mathare live – often lacking jobs, housing and education.Bombaa says they endure a “hand-to-mouth economy”, never sure where their next meal will come from.“People are really angry,” he says, but through art, he feels he can “channel” his community’s anger into something positive as “art unites”.Bombaa set out to create from the exhibitions “micro-utopia” sites dotted around the city.He called it the “jungle room” and hoped to get people to connect with nature from within Mathare itself, in an attempt to bridge the ecological divide.Ironically, the building he had identified as a possible site was demolished by the authorities to make way for a road. Undeterred, he has been taking children from his community, often stuck living in unimaginable urban squalor, to experience Nairobi’s verdant parks and expose them to green spaces.“There are no trees or green spaces in Mathare,” Bombaa says.But by contemplating the idea of utopia, he believes that he can imagine what it would be like if people in his community actually had unrestricted access to the city’s green spaces.In this way, people in his community can claim a right to access nature that is denied to them simply because they are poor. Bombaa also complains about how ordinary Nairobians, often scrabbling to make a living, have to pay to enter some of their city’s most beautiful locations such as the arboretum or Karura forest.The Kairos Futura team are also drawing inspiration from nature to use their imagination in how to address urgent environmental issues.For example, Coltrane McDowell has applied this to architecture.In his work Invisible Cities, he was inspired by termite mounds to reimagine what architecture might look like in the future. Another artist in the show, Abdul Rop, known for his mesmerising woodcut prints and paintings, says that in order to “achieve utopia”, Nairobians need to work together.“That's why the young people are agitating right now for change,” he says, suggesting they are frustrated by a corrupt political system that hems in their potential.Gen Z were at the forefront of proteststhis year against new tax measures, which saw the government make an embarrassing U-turn.Rop argues that by thinking about utopia through the lens of art, young people may find creative ways to fight for their future.Rather than being far-fetched, he thinks that it can help imagine a bolder and more equal future for his city.“The moment to act for the future is now,” he says.

Ewan McGregor takes on first UK theatre role in 17 yearsThe star will appear in My Master Builder in London's West End next year.See more,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3we671xvpqo,"Ewan McGregor has described live theatre as ""good for the soul"", as he announced he is to return to the London stage for the first time in 17 years.The Scottish actor, who has starred in Trainspotting and Moulin Rouge, is set to star in My Master Builder in London's West End between April and July next year.McGregor told BBC News: ""This is the longest I haven’t been on stage, and in honesty, I’ve missed it.""Inspired by Henrik Ibsen's 1892 play The Master Builder, the new show is written by US playwright Lila Raicek and will be directed by Michael Grandage. ""The funny story is, I had literally just finished reading Ibsen’s The Master Builder for pleasure – an extraordinary read,"" McGregor explained. ""Michael got in touch out of the blue and I mentioned how much I’d love to get back on stage.""And in a moment of pure coincidence, he told me he had a play inspired by The Master Builder sitting on his desk. I asked him to send it to me, and here we are. A moment of total serendipity.""He said Raicek had taken the script in a ""fascinating"" direction, describing the new play as a ""very modern take on sexual politics in a way that resonates particularly for this moment we find ourselves in"".""It examines these issues in a very grown-up way,"" he continued. ""And ultimately, I felt like what a great play it would be to see, and therefore what a great play it would be to do."" Ibsen's The Master Builder focused on a middle-aged Norwegian architect who becomes successful by building new homes following a fire that destroys a residential estate.But the ambitious and ruthless architect, Halvard Solness, grapples with feelings of inadequacy and fear of being overtaken by younger talent.The production will begin previews at the Wyndham's Theatre in London on 17 April, and run until 12 July.Grandage and McGregor have previously collaborated on Othello and Guys and Dolls, both for the Donmar theatre, where Grandage was artistic director.McGregor described working on the two shows as ""amazing experiences"", adding he felt ""incredibly safe"" in the director's hands.""I really like the work he gets out of me,"" McGregor said. ""He has great creative intention and ideas before we start in the rehearsal room, but when we are actually rehearsing with him, there’s such a great sense of discovering it together."" McGregor's film credits include Brassed Off, Miss Potter, Black Hawk Down, Angels & Demons, Birds of Prey and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.He played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the first of the Star Wars prequel trilogy Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace in 1999. He revisited the role in subsequent Star Wars films and in the 2022 miniseries Obi-Wan Kenobi.The 53-year-old's other TV credits include Halston, in which he played fashion designer Roy Halston Frowick. McGregor won an Emmy Award in 2021 for his portrayal.His last stage appearance was more than a decade ago, when he appeared in The Real Thing on Broadway, opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal.Reflecting on his return to live theatre, McGregor said: ""I love acting on film and television, and of course, I love acting on stage. I have always been lucky enough to do all three throughout my career.""Theatre teaches you so much about acting, the audience teaches you. What works, what doesn’t. It’s very good for the soul. The live experience. The power of storytelling.""Also I love the routine of it, waking up in the morning with the day aiming towards this event, this electric experience.""Earlier this year, McGregor received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. He said he was ""particularly moved"" his star had been placed beside that of the movie franchise's original Princess Leia, the late actress Carrie Fisher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Golding had been prepared to spend his 10th year in the St Albans pantomime when Covid hit and the run of Mother Goose in December 2020 was scrapped.He moved to Northamptonshire and in 2021, performed in Northampton's Royal and Derngate pantomime instead, where he played the dame for three years.At that time, and with a two-year-old daughter, to be working 10 minutes from where he lived was a ""no-brainer"" but now she is older, he has returned to the Arena.""Don't get me wrong, I loved the three years I've been in Northampton, it's been fantastic and it's a wonderful theatre but to come back to St Albans really feels like sitting in an old comfy chair again,"" he said. This year, Golding, who played comedy great Eric Morecambe in the award-winning play Morecambe,returned to the characterin Paul Hendy's The Last Laugh, which had a successful Edinburgh run and will embark on a national tour in 2025.But before that he will be one of the Ugly Sisters, alongside his best friend, Ian Kirkby, in Cinderella, which he said is ""the greatest of all the pantomimes"".""To be here, back in the old building again it's like nothing's changed but everything has changed,"" he said.""We've even got a working sink in the dressing room now."" Throughout his sojourn in Northamptonshire, Golding remained a patron of the venue, a role he has held since 2018, when he organised its 50th anniversary gala, but which he said had been ""slightly dormant"" since the pandemic.""I had lots of things planned and it was very exciting but then Covid happened and it kind of put the kibosh on anything that we were going to do to get more attention to the arts locally for the people of St Albans,"" he said.Now he is back he said he fully intended to ""take on my patron duties whatever they may be in the future"" and represent the venue on an artistic level. It has been a tricky few years for the Arena, with the pandemic in 2020 and thediscovery of asbestos in December 2021which led to its pantomime closing early and the postponement of all shows for about four months.There has also been discussion aboutreplacing it with a new entertainment space.But Golding is championing the theatre, which is now under new management and ""looking great"", he said.""I'm fighting it's corner,"" he said. ""There's been a big shake up and it's got a very nice, exciting fresh new feel about it, it's a bit of a renaissance moment.""It's had a few licks of paint and it just feels like it's got a new lease of life and a burst of energy.""This old building, I've always said, is probably one of the ugliest buildings in the city but with the biggest heart so it's nice to see some love going back into it again and hopefully we can continue to bring some more joy to the people of the area.""I'd love to be here again... so we'll see what happens next year.""

1 day agoColourful life of 100-year-old artist who's never used a paint brushShe will shortly turn 101 but still paints in her studio at her Swansea home every day.1 day agoWales,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dq95d29jyo,"Acclaimed artist Glenys Cour is just weeks away from her 101st birthday and cannot believe her good fortune.She has built her long and vibrant life around her passion for colour, met the love of her life along the way and even counted the great Welsh poet Dylan Thomas as a friend.She is still painting every day at her home in Mumbles overlooking Swansea Bay.Glenys has never used a paint brush, instead preferring the ""immediacy"" of working oil paint with torn pieces of fabric and her fingers. ""It's exciting, it's terribly exciting, I love it,"" she said.""Colour is the most important thing, certainly in my work as well as in my life.""She said her career as a painter, printmaker, collage and stained-glass artist and teacher meant she mixed with the ""intelligentsia of Swansea"".As well as Dylan Thomas, who she fondly recalls as a ""really naughty boy"",  her social circle included composer Dan Jones, poet Vernon Watkins, painter Ceri Richards and sculptor Ranald Cour who she would go on to marry.This ""pretty hectic"" social life she enjoyed as an adult could not be further from the experience of her childhood years.Born in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, in 1924, the then Glenys Carthew was an only child and the daughter of a colliery manager.Her father's job meant the family moved around the south Wales valleys seven times in total, living in a series of manager's houses set apart from the workers. During theDepressionof the 1930s, the disparity between her relatively comfortable existence and that of the workers and their families left her isolated from other children.""The circumstances of my father being a manager in a colliery meant you didn't make friends,"" she said.She recalled walking behind some terraced houses and hearing a group of children playing and pretending to be her.""They were playing school and I heard them say 'now I'm Glenys Carthew',"" she said.""And I realised I was posh, I didn't know... it was shattering actually."" But at home, her imagination was fuelled by the books her father would read to her and she began making up her own fairy stories that she would tell to her classmates.""When I think of it now I must have been very odd,"" she laughed.She would also spend hours drawing on paper her father would bring home from work and discovered a passion for creating new colours with watercolour paints.Becoming an artist was ""inevitable"", she said, and she flourished at Cardiff School of Art, where she was taught by celebrated painter Ceri Richards.Richards is regarded asone of the most important British artists of the 20th Century.""He opened my eyes, he was wonderful, he taught me how to see,"" she said. After college, she took a teaching position in Fishguard, living with her grandmother and aunt, but it wasn't long before she moved to Swansea to take a  job as an art teacher at Glanmor Girls School.She began attending an evening classes in life drawing at Swansea College of Art, and it was here she met her husband, the sculptor Ronald Cour, who was lecturing there.She was lovestruck the moment she met him.""The funny thing that stood out was the fact he had beautiful hands and anyway, I fancied him,"" she said with a glint in her eye.She decided to hide in the ladies' toilets so she could speak to him as he left the building at the end of the day. ""I waited until he came level with the door and I opened the door and bumped into him,"" she laughed.""We walked down the stairs together and he said to me 'would you like to come for a drink?'.""They headed to the now demolished Bush Hotel on Swansea's High Street.It was to be her first time in the pub and also the first time she met Dylan Thomas, a schoolfriend of her new beau.""I discovered the best place to meet people when you didn't know anybody was the pub,"" she said.""I met all the intelligentsia of Swansea really."" At the age of 25, she married Ronald, who was 10 years her senior.""We had a pretty hectic social life, a wonderful social life, it was a rich social life, music, theatre, everything,"" she said.""I loved it all, I was so lucky and I adored my husband.""He was always over my shoulder telling me I was wonderful.""The couple had a daughter, Jane, and both their careers went from strength to strength.But in May 1978, Glenys' world was torn apart when Ronald died suddenly and unexpectedly, aged just 63.""I didn't think I could live,"" she said.""Honestly, I really thought I couldn't live without him."" She took a week off work and then threw herself into painting.""I don't think I'd have got through it if I hadn't,"" she said.""I immersed myself in it.""I go through that door and forget everything.""Almost five decades on, Ronald remains a huge part of her life and she confessed she still speaks to him.Her living room is adorned with black and white photos of him and his sculptures. After losing Ronald, she entered a period of vital creativity and spent three decades teaching at Swansea College of Art.""I love people and I love teaching,"" she said.""To be standing up in front of a group of students and trying to open their eyes, there's nothing more thrilling than that.""Today her artworks have found their way into numerous private and public collections and she has been exhibited widely in Europe and the US.In 2014, a major retrospective of her work was held at Swansea's Glynn Vivian Art Gallery. To what does she attribute her longevity?""I think it's the fact that I'm working, I'm sure of it, it's a necessity,"" she said.""I could never get over my good luck for the whole of my life, I've been blessed.""I've had a fantastic life. I really, really mean it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 days ago'Theatre should be accessible to all'Heartstopper actor Bradley Riches champions accessible performances at the Aylesbury Waterside.2 days agoBeds, Herts & Bucks",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rj550x7pyo,"Seeing actor Bradley Riches flying high above the audience at Buckinghamshire's Aylesbury Waterside Theatre as Peter Pan, belting out numbers such as A Sky Full of Stars, audiences might be surprised to learn that until he was 10, he was non-verbal.Now, the 23-year-old is a passionate advocate for neurodivergent awareness, especially during the sensory overload of panto season.After Riches' autism diagnosis at the age of nine, he started going to an after-school theatre club where he grew up in Surrey.""When I first joined the group, I didn't use words as a form of communication so I was just there pushing myself out of my comfort zone and being around people who couldn't stop singing,"" he said. He added that he ""found his voice"" by playing characters such as Fizzy in Bugsy Malone.""Watching American TV shows, I was able to impersonate the voice,"" he said.""I had a stammer because I'd never used that muscle before, but I was able to use characters to be like an extension of myself and then this art taught me how to weave that into me, and start speaking as Bradley as well.""Doing a musical theatre degree at Hertfordshire drama school, the Emil Dale Academy, he wrote his dissertation on the challenges for neurodivergent performers, which he said started with auditions.""Some directors don't want to give you a lot [in advance] in order to see what you come with, but that's not helpful for neurodiverse people,"" he said.""You need to know what you're doing, you need to get your brain around it... you just want to see what the room looks like and who you're meeting.""Little things like that could be so easily managed, it's not like we're asking to change the world, it's just asking to put different things in place to make things more accessible for everyone."" Other challenges include the industry's unpredictability, finding a routine when not working, and sensory aspects like being in a busy rehearsal room.""I think slowly once you understand the industry and get used to it you start understanding how you can cope with it,"" he said.Since graduating in 2023, Riches has appeared on the London stage in new musical Babies, in Netflix's LGBTQ drama Heartstopper and ITV's Celebrity Big Brother.Peter Pan is his panto debut which brings another level of unpredictability.""I'm shocked that I am excited for it but I think it's just because it's such a positive experience,"" he said.""Everyone has got each other's back, no one wants anything to go wrong and, obviously with time, with different interactions, you know your way out of it. There are worst-case scenario exits."" Riches' neurodivergence also helps him understand the needs of anyone who finds visiting a theatre daunting.He said it was important to have relaxed performances where house lights were left low and strobe lighting and loud noises or explosions may be removed, and is championing the Waterside's efforts to make theatre inclusive for everyone.""I think the main thing that a lot of people feel is of being judged, especially if anything becomes too much,"" he said.""With relaxed performances there's no judgement, anyone can get up from their seat, you can be as loud or as quiet as you want, you can leave and there's a calm room.""There aresigned, captioned and audio described performancesas well, all these are so crucial because everyone should enjoy the panto magic and it makes everyone feel included.""The Waterside also has sensory bags for any performance which include ear defenders, fidget toys, puzzles, and communication cards and this year sign language has been integrated into one of the panto songs for the first time.Theatre director Grant Brisland said theatre leaders ""must have the mindset of removing barriers and establishing initiatives to broaden access for all"".""Bradley's been an inspiration and catalyst for us to unlock more conversations about what we can do to support our neurodiverse community,"" he said.""Whilst we have a lot more to do, we're headed in the right direction.""

2 days agoBeck Theatre saved from closure after council dealThe Beck Theatre had been due to close in the new year but will now be taken over by a new operator.2 days agoLondon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp69965xjo,"A west London theatre that was set to close in the new year has been saved following a deal with the council.Hillingdon Council has announced a 15-year deal with new operators of the Beck Theatre, Parkwood Theatres, with the option to extend the deal by 10 years.The theatre in Hayes had been due to close in January following a row between the former operator, Trafalgar Entertainment, and the council over subsidies and costs.The deal was struck after the council brought in specialist consultants, Blue Horizon, to source a new operator and avoid a period of closure for the theatre. Jonathan Haynes, a ""Back the Beck"" campaigner, told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS)this was the '""best Christmas present"" anyone could have asked for. He said: ""I'm delighted. We've been very nervous for the last few weeks because the council had gone quiet on the communications front.""But we were hopeful, and campaigned intensely. You can't put it into words. The campaign has really invigorated the borough and shown the council that people can't be pushed around.""I think there is no better news."" The Beck Theatre is expected to move over to the control of Parkwood Theatres in mid-January.Council leader Ian Edwards said they aimed to maintain the theatre while delivering value for money for residents.Tony Doherty, managing director of Parkwood Theatres, said he was ""delighted"" to be securing a long-term future for the theatre while ""bringing fresh and exciting opportunities to the stage"" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

FBI informant who lied about Biden 'bribes' pleads guiltyAlexander Smirnov will likely spend four to six years in prison for making up a story which sparked impeachment hearings.32 mins agoWorld,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnl7qdvjno,"A former informant has pleaded guilty to lying to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about a fake bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.Alexander Smirnov, 44, also admitted tax evasion after not reporting more than $2m (£1.58m) in income.His claims became the basis of an impeachment investigation in Congress which centred around the false claims that the Bidens made millions in bribes from Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.But Smirnov admitted he made the story up, and pleaded guilty in Los Angeles on Monday as part of an agreement with prosecutors. Smirnov, a dual US-Israeli citizen, had been an FBI informant for more than a decade when he made the allegations about the Bidens in June 2020, saying that Joe and Hunter Biden each received $5m from the energy company.Prosecutors said Smirnov was motivated by ""bias"" against President Biden and that he spun his ""routine and unextraordinary business contacts"" with Burisma into tales about bribery that were ""fabrications"".The FBI investigated his statements but within months recommended the case be closed without any legal action taken against the Bidens.But the allegations refused to die, and became the basis for a Republican-led drive to investigate President Biden, including an effort to make Smirnov's initial statement public.Prosecutors say that when he was re-interviewed by FBI agents in September 2023, Smirnov doubled down on his claims.Smirnov was arrested in Nevada as he returned to the US from an overseas trip in February 2024.Alexander Smirnov: FBI source accused of Biden lies 'linked to Russian intelligence'According to court documents, he had ties with Russian intelligence and used his more than $2m in unreported income to buy a Las Vegas condominium, a lease on a Bentley car, and hundreds of thousands of dollars of clothes, jewellery and accessories.The case was brought by Special Counsel David Weiss - who has overseen  an investigation of Hunter Biden.Joe Biden issued a pardon for his son, who faced potential prison time for tax evasion and lying on a form about his drug addiction when he bought a gun.Smirnov will be sentenced in January. The plea agreement is subject to approval by a federal judge.He faces a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison and a $1m fine, however prosecutors and defence lawyers have agreed to a sentence of between four and six years and a restitution payment of $675,502, according to the plea deal.The BBC contacted Smirnov's lawyers for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drone detection system deployed to New York after mystery sightingsThe state governor has asked for more federal support as questions grow over objects spotted in the skies.6 hrs agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvnjp30pplo,"US officials are sending a drone detection system to New York, Governor Kathy Hochul says, after questions over mysterious objects in the skies over the east coast and beyond grew in recent days.Hochul requested the federal assistance after drone sightings forced runways at Stewart International Airport in the state to shut for an hour last week.""In response to my calls for additional resources, our federal partners are sending a drone detection system to New York,"" Hochul wrote on X on Sunday.She said state governments needed more power to deal on their own with the small, uncrewed aircraft that have also been reported in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Massachusetts. And further west, in Ohio, drone sightings also led to the closure of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for about an hour on Friday night, according to local media.""Congress must pass a law that will give us the power to deal directly with the drones,"" Hochul said in her post, after last week promising to ""do whatever it takes to ensure New Yorkers remain safe"".Senator Chuck Schumer said on Sunday he hoped to pass a bill that would give local enforcement more power to investigate unidentified flying objects, saying: ""I'm pushing for answers amid these drone sightings"".He also asked that a drone detection system similar to the one headed for New York also be sent to New Jersey, where most of the aerial encounters have so far been recorded.New Jersey Senator Andy Kim said he went out with local residents over the weekend to observe the night sky, and that he believed - based on conversations with civilian pilots and flight tracking data - that most of the aircraft he saw ""were almost certainly planes"". What we know about mysterious US drone sightingsTwo arrested after 'hazardous drone operation' near Boston airport Despite their demands for more help in dealing with the issue, Hochul and other officials have sought to reassure the public that the suspected drones do not pose a national security threat.On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed the sightings included drones, as well as manned aircraft commonly mistaken for drones. He told ABC News that he knew of ""no foreign involvement"" related to the sightings.The Pentagon has denied the suggestion of one New Jersey representative that the possible drones were coming from an Iranian ""mothership"" lurking off the east coast, while an FBI official has said there may have been ""a slight overreaction"" on the topic.According to Mayorkas, the uptick in drone reports may be due to a change in federal regulations allowing drones to be flown at night.He added that the federal government was working in ""close co-ordination"" with state and local authorities on the issue, saying it was ""critical"" they be given the ability to counter drone activity under federal supervision. With just over a month to go until Donald Trump's inauguration, the president-elect's pick for national security adviser, Republican Representative Mike Waltz, hit out against the Biden administration's response to the sightings.""I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from,"" he told the BBC's US news partner CBS.""We need to get to the bottom of it,"" he said, accusing government agencies of ""pointing at each other"" rather than offering answers.Kim, a Democrat, also called on federal authorities to do more to assuage Americans' concerns.""People have a lot anxiety right now about the economy, health, security etc,"" he wrote on X.""And too often we find that those charged with working on these issues don't engage the public with the respect and depth needed.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A decade since Canada opened its doors, Syrians reflect on home away from homeSyrians in Canada reflect on a decade in the country1 day agoWorld",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kev3k49gwo,"It started with just a small group gathered in Mississauga's Celebration Square, rejoicingthat 10,000 km (6,200 miles) away, the Syrian city of Homs had fallen to rebel forces.But when news broke that President Bashar al-Assad had fled the country, putting an end to the country's civil war, this town square in a small Canadian city became flooded with people celebrating,many of whom had fled Assad's regime for Canada just a decade ago.""I was crying for more than 45 minutes,"" said Khaled Abdulwahed, a 31-year-old Syrian who resettled in Toronto when he was just a young man and helped organise Sunday's impromptu event.Now a Canadian citizen, Mr Abdulwahed - who was 17 when he first participated in anti-government protests in Syria - has continued to advocate for the human-rights of his country, which has earned him the title of the ""Syrian mayor of Toronto"".While many have begun to plan trips to see family and friends, they have also shared how Canada will, for most of them, remain home.""Right now, is our turn to help our people, to rebuild our country and to support them from here,"" he said. Mr Abdulwahed was part of a wave of Syrian refugees who came to Canada between 2015-2016, backed by a campaign promise from newly elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to help resettle 25,000 Syrians at a time when many were dying trying to flee their country.Canada's warm welcome stood in sharp contrast to their neighbour's to the south, where Donald Trump was running his first presidential campaign on a promise to ban Muslims from entering the country. He would later try toban immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.Like Mr Abdulwahed, Muzna Dureid was forced to make the journey to Canada by herself when she was a young woman.Within the first three months of the revolution, the then-21-year-old witnessed her brother's arrest, her social media accounts hacked by Assad intelligence officers and an uncle's assassination for his pro-democracy activities.""This was the tipping point,"" she said on a call from her older brother's new home in Spain. He was released a year after the arrest, but the family had by that point fled Damascus and spread out across the world.While Ms Dureid's parents stayed in Saudi Arabia, she managed to secure a fellowship in Turkey before landing another one in 2016 to study in Montreal.A call-out on Facebook for a couch to stay on soon transformed into a lifelong bond. The Quebec family who put her up for that first night - and continued to for that first year - would later go on to privately-sponsor the rest of her family to join her in Canada. Since 1979, Canadians have helped resettleover 390,000 refugeesthrough private sponsorship - which differs from government-assisted programmes as the cost of resettlement is borne by an individual or group.As Canada raced to resettle Syrians fleeing the war, it proved to be essential in meeting that goal; nearly half arrived through some form of private sponsorship, according to theGovernment of Canada.Canada's has gone on to resettlemore than 100,000 Syrians,all through a mixture of government-assisted and private sponsorships.It is a small number compared to how many refugees countries around Syria - namely Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan - took in since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. But their warm welcome in Canada has helped make them feel like an integral part of their new community, Ms Dureid said.""This is why people believe they belong to this country, not for a temporary period, but that this is their country,"" she said.The human-rights activist and policy advisor, who has worked with Canada's ministry for gender equality, says that now that Assad is gone, she'll likely split her time between Syria and Canada.""My dream is to have a ministry for gender equality in Syria and be part of this work,"" she said.""I think a lot of us are gonna be between both countries and serving both countries equally.""But there are signs that Canada's doors-open attitude has been shifting in recent years, with Trudeau's government moving to reduce the number of permanent residents in the country as it grapples with a persistent cost of living and housing crisis.It is unclear what effect - if any - this would have on Canada's refugee resettlement programme. In 2023, the country became the fifth-largest recipient of asylum seekers worldwide. Maya Almasalmeh, a sociology student at Western University, was just 17 years old when she arrived in London, Ontario with her family in 2016.In the Syrian city of Deraa, she lost her grandfather - ""a second father figure"" - along with her home amidst the siege on the city, which would come to be known as the birthplace of the uprising against Assad.""He stole our childhood,"" she said.Being the eldest daughter of seven siblings in an immigrant home, she said, meant that she also viewed herself as a second parent figure to her many brothers and sisters. And that sense of responsibility extends beyond her front door in London.""Canada is the country that gave us peace, it [gave] me my education and helped me to develop to the person who I am today,"" Ms Almasalmeh said. But, she stressed, we ""will go back"" to help ""build the new generation.""She goes on to outline in great detail her long-term goals.""I want to be a social worker, because the people who helped us in the beginning, it was a lot of kind social workers,"" she explained, noting that her ""second home"" of Deraa will need people with her skills to rebuild.But like Ms Dureid and Mr Abdulwahed, the 25-year-old doesn't foresee Syria becoming a permanent base.""Canada is our home. I would say, it's our heart,"" she said. ""We will never forget how Canada gave us the chance to live happy again."" Yet some of those celebrating are also exercising a heavy level of caution before booking flights to see distant relatives.""Edmonton - this is my home. This is where my family is,"" explained 36-year-old Basel Abou Hamrah, who resettled in the Canadian prairies with his mother and three siblings in late 2015.Mr Abou Hamrah said there are concerns when he thinks about going back to Syria. Part of his struggles when he first arrived in Edmonton stemmed from the fact that he hadn't yet come out to his family as gay.There is also uncertainty about what the future holds for Syria, which was liberated by an Islamist rebel group that was once an off-shoot of Al-Qaeda, though it had rebranded itself in recent years.Questions have swirled on what type of government the group would form, and how much freedoms Syrians will have under this new leadership.""It's not safe for LGBTQ refugee people back home in Syria,"" he explained.Prior to the 2011 revolution, there were reports of gay menbeing targeted by police.Mr Abou Hamrah said this is why the news this week, that some European countries are choosing topause asylum decisionsfor Syrian refugees, causes him grave concern.""There are lots of LGBTQ refugees that - no matter what is the new government of the new Syria - they will not be safe,"" Mr Abou Hamrah said, citing how the situation in the country is still in ""flux"". Moving back to Syria on a more permanent basis may be, for others, the news they've been waiting to hear since the civil war pushed them from their homes years ago.""Canada gave us safety and dignity,"" explained Israa El Issa, a mother of four, from her home in Prince George, British Columbia. ""There has never been a day where I felt like a refugee or not Canadian or unwanted.""She and her family fled Aleppo and were later sponsored out of Lebanon by a group of private citizens on the western coast of Canada.Up until this week, she had been planning to carry on with her studies in Canada to one day become a nurse. But she said now that's all been put on hold: ""God willing I'll finish in Syria instead.""A motivating factor for returning to Syria is an intense feeling of ""estrangement"" she has felt for the family she left behind, after trying, and failing, to bring her father and mother to join her.""That's all I wanted,"" she explained. But her father died from cancer about eight months after she moved. She tried to bring her mom, but said she struggled navigating the system.""I tried so many times, but no result,"" she said.Despite these difficulties, she doesn't begrudge the country that took her in and instead views it as a natural process to want to return home.""At the end of the day, Syria is our country. And why are we refugees in the first place? Because there was war in our country and it wasn't safe to stay,"" she said.""But now that Syria is free from the oppression of Assad, and God willing safety returns to Syria, then of course we will return too.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Canada's finance minister quits over Trump tariff dispute with TrudeauChrystia Freeland says Canada faces a ""grave challenge"" from incoming US President Donald Trump's tariff threats.3 hrs agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2elggj813o,"Canada's Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland has resigned from her post, citing disagreements with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on how to respond to incoming President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs.She announced her resignation in a letter to Trudeau on Monday, in which she said the two have been ""at odds about the best path forward for Canada"", and pointed to the ""grave challenge"" posed by Trump's policy of ""aggressive economic nationalism"".Freeland said the decision comes after Trudeau informed her last week that he no longer wanted her to be his government's top economic adviser.Her resignation came hours before she was due to provide an annual fiscal government update in parliament. In recent days, the two have also reportedly been in a dispute over a policy that would have delivered a C$250 ($175; £139) cheque to every eligible Canadian.The BBC has reached out to the prime minister's office and the finance department for comment.In her publicly-shared resignation letter, Freeland said Canada needs to keep its ""fiscal powder dry"" to deal with the threat of sweeping tariffs from US President-elect Donald Trump.She added this means ""eschewing costly political gimmicks"" that Canada cannot afford.Trump has promised to imposea levy of 25% on imported Canadian goods, which economists have warned would significantly hurt Canada's economy.Referencing the tariffs, Freeland called them a ""threat"" that needs to be taken ""extremely seriously"".She added that this means ""pushing back against 'America First' economic nationalism"" and working with unity in response to these tariff threats.Freeland and Trudeau were reportedly in disagreement over a series of recently-proposed policies by the prime minister designed to address the country's cost-of-living crisis.Among them is a cheque of C$250 that the government wanted to send to every Canadian earning less than C$150,000 annually. These cheques were expected to cost the federal government a total of C$4.68bn.Another is a temporary tax break on essential items during the holidays which is anticipated to cost C$1.6bn in lost tax revenue.Freeland's office had reportedly been concerned about the price of these two policies, saying they are economically unwise at a time when the country's deficit is growing.The tax holiday has since been approved in the House of Commons, but the C$250-cheques hit a hurdle when the New Democratic Party - a centre-left party in parliament - signalled it would not lend its support to the policy unless it is expanded.A poll bythe Angus Reid Institute showed that four out of five Canadians viewed the cheques as a political movedesigned to win public goodwill as Trudeau's popularity plummets.Freeland, who also holds the position of deputy prime minister, has long been one of Trudeau's closest allies within his Liberal party. She has held the key role of Canada's finance minister since 2020, helping to lead the country through the pandemic and its aftermath.She replaced former Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who also resigned from his post amid a dispute with Trudeau over government spending policies, as well as conflict-of-interest allegations he faced involving a youth charity.Other members of the Liberal party's cabinet have since reacted to her resignation.""These are difficult and deeply personal decisions and obviously she's made that decision and I respect her for it,"" said Patty Hajdu, Canada's minister for indigenous relations.Minister of Transport Anita Anand described Freeland as a ""good friend,"" and added: ""This news has hit me really hard and I'll reserve further comment until I have time to process it.""It is unclear if the fall economic statement will be delivered on Monday as planned in light of Freeland's resignation. A government official told Reuters news agency that the finance ministry is determining next steps.Canada's public broadcaster CBC reported that Freeland's resignation was not expected today, citing a senior federal government source.Freeland said she intends to stay on as a Liberal member of parliament, and that she will run again in Canada's upcoming election, which must be held on or before October.Her resignation comes after another cabinet member, housing minister Sean Fraser, announced he will not be seeking re-election, saying he wants to spend more time with his family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US officials in 'direct contact' with victorious Syria rebelsSecretary of State Antony Blinken confirms contact with the HTS group, despite it still being on the US terrorism list.1 day agoMiddle East",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y46713z21o,"The US has made ""direct contact"" with the HTS rebels who now control Syria after topplingthe Assad regime, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.It is the first acknowledgement of direct US interaction with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which the US currently still designates as a terrorist organisation.Blinken told reporters the US has been in contact in particular over the fate of the missing American journalist, Austin Tice.Blinken was speaking in Jordan after talks with representatives from several Arab countries, Turkey, and Europe to discuss the future of Syria. Officials agreed to support a peaceful transition process in the country, with Jordan's foreign minister saying that regional powers did not want to see it ""descend into chaos"".A joint communique called for an inclusive Syrian government that respects the rights of minorities and does not offer a base for ""terrorist groups"".The talk both inside and outside Syria after the tumultuous events of recent weeks has been of the vital importance of setting up new governance that represents all Syrians.HTS was not present at the meeting in Jordan.There, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein expressed concern over Syria's future shared across the Middle East and beyond.He said regional players did not want to see another Libya - referring to the chaos that ensued after Colonel Gaddafi's removal from power.Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said existing Syrian institutions must be preserved and reformed.""Never allow terrorism to take advantage of the transition period. And we have to coordinate our efforts and learn from the mistakes of the past,"" Fidan said according to Reuters news agency. Trump says Syria 'not our fight'. Staying out may not be so easyUS military flies freed captive Travis Timmerman out of SyriaFormer Syria prison head charged with torture in US Meanwhile, Israel has launched dozens more air strikes against Syria, according to a war monitor, despite regional condemnation.Israelhas previously saidit was taking action to ""destroy strategic capabilities"" that threaten it.The UN Secretary General has said he is ""particularly concerned"" about the hundreds of Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Syria.HTS, Syria's most powerful rebel group, was set up under a different name,Jabhat al-Nusra, in 2011 as a direct al-Qaeda affiliate. It was considered to be one of the most effective and deadly groups opposing President Assad.It was proscribed as a terrorist group by the UN, the US, Turkey, and other countries - and currently remains so.Its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who previously used the name Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, cut ties with al-Qaeda in 2016. He has recently pledged tolerance for different religious groups and communities.But the group's violent jihadist past has left some doubting whether it will live up to such promises.Missing from the talks in Jordan was any representative from Syria. The foreign ministers from eight Arab countries who did attend the meeting said they wanted to ensure that Syria was unified and not split along sectarian lines.Also absent were the two countries that gave financial support to Assad which enabled him to survive in power for so long - Iran and Russia.Assad's downfall followed a 13-year civil war, which started after he crushed pro-democracy protests. The fighting killed more than half a million people, displaced millions more, and embroiled international powers and their proxies.The shadow of all the outside forces that battled over Syria for so long hangs heavy over its future.Syria's next leaders will need cohesion not just inside the country but outside, too, if there is to be any real hope for the Syrian people to build on the freedom they have experienced in the past week.

"Pelosi has hip replacement surgery after fall in LuxembourgPelosi, 84, was airlifted by the US military to a hospital in Germany after she tripped at an event.2 days agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce329pv42y4o,"Former US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has had hip replacement surgery after injuring herself while on an official trip to Luxembourg, her office says.""Earlier this morning, Speaker Emerita Pelosi underwent a successful hip replacement and is well on the mend,"" her spokesman Ian Kreger said in a statement.Pelosi, 84, was airlifted by the US military to a hospital in Germany after she reportedly tripped and fell on stairs while attending an official event on Friday.The California Democratic congresswoman was travelling with a bipartisan delegation of lawmakers to Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. Pelosi thanked both US military staff at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany and medical staff at Hospital Kirchberg in Luxembourg.""Speaker Pelosi is enjoying the overwhelming outpouring of prayers and well wishes and is ever determined to ensure access to quality health care for all Americans,"" the statement added.She has withdrawn from the rest of the events she had scheduled for the trip.In an earlier statement on Friday, Mr Kreger said Pelosi was looking forward to returning home to the US soon and was continuing to work from hospital.The delegation she was travelling with in Luxembourg is scheduled to take part in anniversary events along with veterans, their families and military officials.One of the congressmen on the trip, Michael McCaul, said he was disappointed Pelosi would not be able to join the delegation's weekend events.""But she is strong, and I am confident she will be back on her feet in no time,"" the Texas Republican said.Pelosi has been a prominent figure in US politics over a career stretching seven presidential administrations.She first served as House speaker from 2007-11, a post second in line to the presidency after the vice-president, then regained the job in 2019 after her party took back control of the chamber.She resigned as Speaker in 2023, but continues to serve in the House and remains a highly influential voice within the Democratic Party.Last month, she was elected to another two-year term.She is not the only member of Congress to be injured in a fall this week.Outgoing Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, 82, suffered a sprained wrist and cuts to his face at the US Capitol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tornado hits northern California town as ice storm chills MidwestA twister touched down in Scotts Valley as one person was killed during ice storms in Nebraska.20 hrs agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv8z7jx70o,"At least four people were injured after a tornado struck northern California on Saturday afternoon, according to local authorities.The twister flipped over several cars and brought down power lines in Scotts Valley, located around 55 miles (89km) south of San Francisco, police said.The National Weather Service (NWS) said the tornado was categorised as an EF1, one of the weakest classifications, and that it lasted around five minutes.Elsewhere in the US, an ice storm swept into the Midwestern states of Iowa and Nebraska, heavy snowfall hit upstate New York, and severe weather warnings were issued around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the states of California and Nevada. In Nebraska, at least one person was killed in a crash on an icy road near Arlington. Washington County Sheriff's Office said a 57-year-old woman lost control of her pickup truck and crashed into an oncoming vehicle.A major highway between Iowa and Nebraska, Interstate 80, was shut down as vehicles slid off the road due to the icy conditions. It has since reopened.In upstate New York, people ploughed snow out of their driveways, with more than 33in (83cm) of snow reported near Orchard Park in Erie County.To the west, in Nevada, up to 3ft of snow was predicted in the Sierra Nevada mountains.Snow also hit areas around Lake Tahoe, with some ski resorts seeing more than 1ft.A 112mph gust of wind was recorded at the Mammoth Mountain resort south of Yosemite National Park, the NWS said.In California's Scotts Valley, the tornado touched down at 13:39 local time (21:39 GMT) on Saturday, police said.The local fire service said four people had been injured and two of them had been taken to hospital, the BBC's US partnerCBS Newsreported.Wind speeds were estimated to have peaked at around 90mph, the NWS said.The weather agency also said the twister had been around 30 yards wide and travelled for a quarter of a mile before subsiding. Earlier on Saturday, a brief tornado warning was issued to residents of downtown San Francisco and San Mateo County just before 06:00 local time.San Francisco last saw a tornado in 2005, though that struck without any clear radar signature, so no warning was issued in that case, NWS meteorologist Roger Glass told AP news agency.As of Sunday, more than 40,000 customers were still without power along the California coast, with Monterey county the worst affected,according to the PowerOutage website.San Francisco's tornado alert came just a week after the citysaw its first ever tsunami warning.The brief advisory was issued for northern California and southern Oregon following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that hit off the northern coast of the state.It was later rescinded, and no injuries were reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dark fandom behind healthcare CEO murder suspectOnline adulation painting Luigi Mangione as a folk hero and fuelled by health system anger has worried authorities.3 days agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8nk75vg81o,"They came in hoodies, they came in masks, shuffling their feet and laughing nervously while waiting for a winner to be announced.Just a few days after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was murdered on a New York City sidewalk, these young men had lined up in Washington Square Park to compete in a lookalike contest for the man wanted for his murder.It was sparsely attended and seen as a joke by those who did turn up, said Talia Jane, a journalist who was there.But it underlined an obsession with a murder suspect that has gripped social media since the killing on 4 December, fuelled by latent anger directed at America's private health insurers.""There was a lot of tinder already there, a lot of discontent, a lot of frustration already there, and [this] sort of threw a match on it,"" Ms Jane said.And it has only grown since the suspect was named as Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League-educated member of a prominent Baltimore family.Tracing the powerful family roots of suspected killer Luigi MangioneIn TikTok videos, memes and group chats, a young man accused of shooting a father-of-two in the back on a New York City sidewalk has been fawned over and praised as a kind of folk hero.This fetishisation was remarkably widespread, not limited to radical corners of the internet or any political affiliation, troubling many observers.""We do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,"" said Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, where Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's.""In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice."" Almost immediately after Mr Thompson was shot dead, the internet began to lionise his suspected killer. On TikTok, people posted videos of a ""CEO assassin"" New York City walking tour. On Spotify, playlists dedicated to the suspect started to appear.Once Mr Mangione was arrested, these fans came to his defence.The start of his legal battles prompted anonymous donors to chip in thousands of dollars towards his defence through various online fundraisers.Etsy was flooded with pro-Mangione apparel, while Amazon pulled similar products from their site.The McDonald's worker alleged to have turned him in has become a target for online hate, while the fast-food franchise itself has been spammed with bad reviews.The police department in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that arrested him even received death threats.Much of this online reaction has focused on his looks, with the internet dubbing him the ""hot assassin"".Indeed, Mr Mangione's appearance, which he showed off in shirtless social media posts, is now clearly part of the appeal, said cultural critic Blakely Thornton.Americans are effectively ""programmed"" to trust and empathise with men who look like Mr Mangione, he said.""That's why they are the protagonists in our movies, books and stories.""Public adoration for handsome menaccused of crimes is not new - from Ted Bundy to Jeremy Meeks, violent men have developed cult followings.But Professor Tanya Horeck, an expert on digital culture and true crime from Anglia Ruskin University, says that social media has given those sentiments massive visibility, and helped them spread.The internet has caused ""a blurring of the lines between celebrity and criminality"", she told the BBC, adding that when people see a good-looking person pop into their feeds, their first thought is lust, not moral criticism.""The mood around Luigi Mangione is 'thirst',"" she said.Beyond his appearance, a large part of Mr Mangione's online appeal is clearly his apparent ire against the private healthcare industry and corporate elites in general. US media has reported that Mr Mangione was arrested carrying a handwritten document that said ""these parasites had it coming"".The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), a non-profit extremism research group based in New Jersey, said that after the shooting the hashtag #EatTheRich went viral.Since Mr Mangione's arrest, variations of ""#FreeLuigi"" were posted on X over 50,000 times, likely getting tens of millions of impressions. And by some measures, the NCRI said, engagement with posts about Mr Thompson's killing across platforms like X, Reddit, and others surpassed that of the assassination attempt against Donald Trump in July. An analysis of a sample of comments carried out by market research firm OneCliq found the vast majority - four-fifths - contained criticism of the healthcare system.Mr Mangione's X account has gained more than 400,000 followers since the shooting.The shooting also seemed to inspire others to take action against healthcare insurers - ""wanted"" posters of other CEOs appeared around New York City,and a woman in Florida was arrestedafter telling an insurance agent on the phone ""Delay, Deny, Depose. You people are next,"" alluding to the words inscribed on bullet casings found at the murder scene.Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser at the NCRI, called the online reaction a ""turning point"" and ""a catalyst for the normalisation of political violence that was once confined to extremists on the fringes"".He compared the wave of comments to the online activity following racist mass murders, designed to defend the killers and signal-boost their beliefs - only more widespread, and happening across mainstream social media networks.""The dynamic we are observing is eerily similar to the activity on platforms like 4chan, 8chan, Discord, and in other dark corners of the internet, where mass shootings are often met with glee,"" he said.Tim Weninger, a computer science professor at Notre Dame and expert in social media and artificial intelligence, said evidence suggests that the groundswell was authentic - not powered by bots or government influence operations.""People are pissed off at the healthcare industry and they are using social media to express their frustrations,"" he said. ""They're expressing those frustrations by supporting this suspect."" Recent research by Commonwealth Fund, a health policy institute, found 45% of insured working-age adults were charged for something they thought should have been free or covered by insurance, and 17% of respondents said their insurer denied coverage for care that was recommended by their doctor.There are indications that the shooting has prompted some introspection on the part of healthcare companies.""I think all of us are taking a step back and trying to understand what's happening with patients and their experiences,"" Pfizer's chief sustainability officer Caroline Roan told a conference in New York on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Some of the people who have been protesting against health insurance companies for years, before online criticism about UHC took off, understand some of the darker sentiments, even if they don't endorse them.""It's a horrific act of violence, and I absolutely condemn it no matter the motivation,"" Jenn Coffey, who has been fighting to get UHC to cover her medical bills, said of Mr Thompson's killing. ""But I'm not shocked by the reaction."" Ms Coffey, 53, from Manchester, New Hampshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 and later fell ill with complex regional pain syndrome, a potentially debilitating neurological condition. When a doctor suggested that she try ketamine therapy, her UHC insurance would not cover the procedure, she said. She has since become involved in a protest campaign organised by activist group People's Action.Ms Coffey's illness forced her to stop working as an emergency medical technician. She said she started a crowdfunding drive and had to sell most of her belongings in order to pay for the treatment herself.""I get to have some normality. I can sit up and paint, or I can enjoy a meal with my family"" because of the treatment, she said. ""I can have a life that's worth living.""UnitedHealth Group told the BBC they could not comment on individual cases for privacy reasons.At the same time, much of the online discussion has effectively ignored the victim, Brian Thompson, who was 50.""It's incredibly bleak that [Thompson's death] hasn't been covered as much because, bottom line, a person died, a person was murdered,"" Blakely Thornton said.""The collective rage over [the healthcare industry] is really outweighing what is still a tragedy."" In his last post on LinkedIn, Mr Thompson talked about efforts to make healthcare more affordable - and was criticised in the comments. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, obtained a message that UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty sent to staff this week, memorialising Mr Thompson and calling his murdered colleague ""one of the good guys"".""He was certainly one of the smartest guys. I think he was one of the best guys. I'm going to miss him. And I am incredibly proud to call him my friend,"" he wrote.In the email, the company shared messages from customers, including one who wrote about recovering from cancer, saying their treatment was paid for by the insurance company's benefits.""I'm thankful to UHC and everyone there who works within a broken system to help as many people as they can,"" they wrote, according to the company.Another message said: ""So very sad that this world is so hateful. I have always had great experiences with UHC.""Ms Coffey, the UHC policyholder and patient, said: ""My heart goes out to the family and I can't imagine what they're having to struggle with that [killing]. It's awful to me that this is the catalyst for this debate.""""I would have much rather sat down and had a conversation with him.""With additional reporting from Grace Dean",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Xi Jinping not expected to attend Trump inaugurationChina's ambassador is expected to attend and other officials may join him, two people told the BBC's US partner CBS.3 days agoWorld",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm9jvek93po,"Chinese President Xi Jinping is unlikely to attend the US presidential inauguration in January despite an invitation from Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the planning.China's ambassador to the US is expected to attend and other officials from Beijing may also join him, the sources told the BBC's US partner CBS News.CBS first reported on the unusual invitation – records indicate no foreign leaders have ever attended a presidential inauguration.""This is an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just allies but our adversaries and our competitors too,"" Trump's spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Fox News. Trump has at times praised Xi but has also been heavily critical of China. He has pledged to sharply increase tariffs on imported Chinese goods when he takes office next month.In October, Trump told podcaster Joe Rogan: ""He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist.

How Luigi Mangione's legal defence could take shapePolice believe forensic and ballistic evidence ties the suspect to insurance CEO Brian Thompson's killing.5 days agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm987p8xz3o,"Forensic and ballistic evidence that police say ties the accused murderer of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson to the crime scene will make it difficult for his lawyers to mount a defence, former prosecutors and other legal experts say.Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested in Pennsylvania on Monday after a days-long, multi-state manhunt ended at a McDonalds in the town of Altoona.New York authorities say fingerprints and shell casings link him to the crime scene.His lawyer, Thomas Dickey, earlier told local media he had not ""seen any evidence yet"" implicating his client. He said Mr Mangione would plead not guilty to the charges he faces in Pennsylvania, including firearms charges.In New York, he has been charged with second-degree murder over Mr Thompson's killing and it is not clear how he would plead. He is currently being held in a state prison in Pennsylvania where he is fighting extradition to face that murder charge. The legal battle over his extradition could potentially take more than a month to resolve, officials said.But legal experts told the BBC that his efforts to contest his extradition to New York are unlikely to be successful. They could, however, provide his defence with a glimpse into the state's evidence against him.""I don't even know if this is him,"" his lawyer, Mr Dickey, said in a recent interview with US media outlet NewsNation, referring to images of Mr Thompson's killer.""We're going to test those waters and give the government a chance to bring some evidence forward,"" he said.How the six-day manhunt unfoldedWhat is a ghost gun, the weapon allegedly used in shooting?Who is the CEO shooting suspect?Who was UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson?If he is extradited to New York to face the murder charge, Mitchell Epner, a New York-based lawyer and former prosecutor, told the BBC that  there are, broadly, two approaches that Mr Mangione could take if he pleads not guilty.""Defence number one is 'it wasn't me' and defence number two is 'it was me, but I shouldn't be punished' because of X,"" he said.According to New York police, Mr Mangione was found with a gun similar to the murder weapon, a silencer and a fake ID, as well as three handwritten pages which they believe suggest a potential motive.Mr Epner said that the publicly known evidence so far means denying responsibility is ""out the window"".Another New York-based lawyer, criminal defence attorney and Professor Dmitriy Shakhnevich, said Mr Mangione's attorney could also, in theory, argue that an impaired ""mental status"" makes him unfit to stand trial.""If a judge makes a determination that he's misunderstanding, or not understanding, what's happening in court, then essentially the case won't go forward,"" he  said.""He'll be institutionalised for a period of time until he's deemed to be fit, which may be never.""That defence, Mr Shakhnevich added, is different to a plea of insanity, in which his lawyers could argue that ""he's not responsible for his actions because of some mental defect"".""That could also deem him not guilty, because you won't satisfy the elements of the offence,"" he said. ""But then again, he doesn't go free. He would be institutionalised for a period, assuming that defence is successful."" The start of Mr Mangione's legal battles has prompted anonymous donors to chip in thousands of dollars towards his defence through online fundraisers.It comes as some online have shared support for the suspect and anger at the health insurance industry. The New York City Police Department has also warned some healthcare executives are potentially in danger because of a ""hit list"" posted online after Mr Thompson's murder.In a bulletin, the NYPD said several viral posts included the names and salaries of other insurance executives. Mocked-up wanted signs featuring some executives have also been posted in Manhattan.Mr Mangione allegedly had grievances with the wider industry.Timothy Gallagher, a former FBI agent and the managing director of Nardello and Co, a global investigations firm, said the current climate means the ""threat of a copycat is real"".""There are people out there who have grievances and are observing the amount of press and attention that is being given to the accused,"" he said.Mr Gallagher said that there has been an ""outpouring of support from dark corners of the internet"" for anti-corporate causes.""I'm afraid that may fuel follow-on attacks,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
